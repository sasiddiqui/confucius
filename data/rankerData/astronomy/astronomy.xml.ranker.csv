"<p>The chemical evolution of galaxies is an important way to learn about their formation and stellar/gaseous constituents. Many galaxies show narrow emission lines at optical wavelengths (3500-9000 Angstroms) from ionized elements (e.g., [O II] at 3727 Angstroms) and recombination Balmer lines (e.g., H$\alpha$ at 6563 Angstroms). The origin of the ionized emission line flux can depend on the amount of the element present in the galaxy, and also on the nature of the ionizing source (i.e., the oft-mentioned <dq>shape of the ionizing spectrum<dq>).</p><br><br><p>I have a few questions that I cannot seem to find clear answers to in textbooks, publications and review papers.

Again, why? I would think if the metallicity or oxygen abundance is higher, then there is an increased chance of getting more [O II] and [O III] emission. Also, assuming that metallicity is higher, the amount of hydrogen should decrease, and this would decrease the $H\beta$ flux in the $R_{23}$ ratio above, thus increasing the ratio at high abundance. </p></li><br></ol><br>","14509","1"

"<p>What I mean is, with a central mass orbits are relatively simple, but orbits around the galaxy are different, in essence as the star orbits through the dark matter halo, the further it moves away from the center of the galaxy the greater the gravitational field, so while orbits tend to slow down as kinetic energy is turned into potential energy, stars are effectively orbiting around more mass the further they are from the center of the galaxy, which might speed them up. The equal areas over equal time rule would seem to no longer apply.</p><br><br><p>So, ignoring up and down motion relative to the plane of the galaxy, is there a common shape for galactic orbits? Is there a formula? I think eccentricity would still apply, but I don't think the orbits would be ellipses, so it would be a different kind of eccentricity. Would these orbits tend to circularize (in an ideal dark matter cloud, ignoring perturbations. Obviously perturbations would lead to, in a practical sense, unpredictable orbits, not neat and tidy formulas. I gather from a show I caught on the science channel that the Milky Way's magnetic field also plays a role in forming its spiral arms, but I'm asking in an ideal, mathematical sense, what shape would orbits be through a galaxy, from a 2D point of view, ignoring up and down motion.</p><br><br><p><strong>Update</strong></p><br><br><p>It occurred to me that the question might be more simply asked by a black hole in effect <dq>orbiting<dq> through a planet or even a low-velocity neutrino (if there are any low-velocity neutrinos).

"<p>On a casual star walk, (for comparison of identifying different objects) I witnessed some meteors, quite a few satellites gliding on their smooth and straight trajectories, and some airplanes with their much brighter (sometimes blinking) lights, lower altitude and the characteristic sense of moving towards and away from me.

The airplanes made noise, this one did not. Visually perfectly identical with all of the normal satellites. I had never seen anything like that before so I wondered if it could've been some debris colliding into things, but probably not. The best explanation I have for now is that it apparently might have been a satellite on a Tundra or Molniya orbit, as their ground tracks aren't the usual straight or sine wave shaped trajectories that we're used to.

"<p>Recently, I got around to seeing the movie <em>Interstellar</em>. In it, the characters of the movie visit a stellar system that appears to be built around a black hole instead of a star. On top of this, their mission is to find a habitable planet in this system. I was wondering how stable the system, as a whole, would be in terms of operation and would any of the planets be habitable at all due to the obvious differences between a star and a black hole.</p><br><br><p>In the movie the black hole is supposed to be a 'supermassive rotating black hole'. As for being a binary star system, it's never stated as such nor depicted as such. It's depicted visually as the black hole alone being the center. However one of the characters does mention a <dq>Neutron Star<dq> as part of the system so it could possibly be a binary star system. The ambient lighting for the planets is generated by the accretion disk of the black hole. The size and rotation speed of the event horizon are not defined in the movie. At least not that I can remember. </p><br><br><p>As for the planets, their proximity varies, with the first planet depicted as being so close to the event horizon that it is effected by time dilation. The distances of the other two are not specified directly, but traveling to the second planet out seemingly takes days, while traveling to the third planet out is stated to take months, if I remember correctly. As for their surface gravity, the first planet is depicted as having higher surface gravity than Earth but not so much higher that movement is impossible, just strained. The second planet is depicted as being '80<percent> Earth's gravity', if memory serves me correctly. </p><br><br><p>To better help define certain variables relevant to the question I found an info-graphic related to the movie that illustrates the size of the black hole and it's rotational speed: <a href=<dq>http://tinyurl.com/pqph8wl<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>http://tinyurl.com/pqph8wl</a></p><br>","8493","3","11535","0"

"<p>I would like to know how large a telescope's  mirror aperture would need to be, that is pointed squarely at Sirius to equal the light intensity at the focus of a 5 inch glass lens of our Sun?

"<p>I'm trying to think through what the cost would be of an unmanned mission to a nearby asteroid.  To me it seems like the high-level costs would be the fixed cost of the <dq>spaceship<dq> itself (including any scientific or mining equipment required to carry out the mission), the cost of getting into orbit which would depend on the ship mass, and the fuel to get there and return (which would be a function of fuel cost, ship mass, how fast you want to get there, and the mass of anything collected at the asteroid site that would be returned).  Is there anywhere that this is discussed or has anyone thought this through further?</p><br>","12641","4"
"<p>Supposing a planet is made entirely of gas, is it possible for the planet to become tidally locked with the star it orbits? </p><br><br><p>I know when a terrestrial planet orbits a star in a different amount of time than the length of its day, the planet warps continuously, resulting in tidal heating. This heating takes energy from the planet's rotation until it stabilizes in a tide-locked formation. </p><br><br><p>I believe a purely gaseous planet would also have some sort of internal heating for the same reason. But because the <dq>surface<dq> of a gas planet is fluid, it must also obey thermodynamic principles.</p><br><br><p>As a basic example, the side of the planet facing a star gets hot, and the side facing away gets cold. The hot gas expands and the cold gas contracts and you get convection, Hadley cycles, prevailing winds, and chaotic weather patterns.</p><br><br><p>So it seems like there's a battle between gravity, which wants the gas to stop moving and become tide-locked, and thermodynamics, which wants the surface to roil with convection.</p><br><br><p>Does one process dominate over the other? Does one process slowly take over as the other fades away? Can it go either way?</p><br>","19262","1"

"<p>The Moon is tidally locked to Earth - a long time ago it was spinning, but after a time, the spin stopped - two factors stabilizing it: unequal mass distribution creating an equilibrium position where there's one <dq>preferred<dq> axis by which it faces Earth - an attractor, and the dynamic tidal forces acting as stress upon its structure, dissipating the energy - a friction, reducing the rotation speed.</p><br><br><p>So, at one point in time, it would no longer complete a full spin, but instead reverse its turn direction, start spinning in opposite direction, with maximum spin speed around the time where the <dq>preferred<dq> axis faces Earth, then slowing down again, until its spin stops, and reverses direction again - each time the angle smaller as the dynamic forces act against the direction of rotation - but also, with the rotation angle and angular velocity dropping, the value of the dynamic forces dropping.</p><br><br><p>There is a significant apparent wobble caused by the orbit's eccentricity, and possibly some actual continuous wobble, as the result - with the attractor axis missing Earth as result. But is there any long-term oscillation left over from the times when the Moon was spinning - a harmonic motion around its original spin axis, that would likely not be in tune with the orbital period? (I imagine the period of these oscillations would be very long; after all it's about reversing Moon's spin back and forth, by a force that isn't all that strong.)</p><br>","17959","2","17958","0"
"<p>Recently I purchase Chinese 8 inch reflector telescope from local store. When I observing starts and planets I've been having trouble getting really sharp image from this telescope.

Three wide rings, concentric, wider than the planet itself.<dq></p><br>  <br>  <p>Trevize said, <dq>I never heard of such a thing. I don't think rings can be that wide.

No other inhabited world in the Galaxy has such a satellite. Large satellites are invariably associated with the uninhabited and uninhabitable gas-giants.

It's rather farther from the planet than one might expect but it's definitely revolving about it. It's only the size of a small planet; in fact, it's smaller than any of the four inner planets circling the sun. Still, it's large for a satellite. It's at least two thousand kilometers in diameter, which makes it in the size range of the large satellites that revolve about gas giants.<dq></p><br>  <br>  <p><dq>No larger?<dq> Pelorat seemed disappointed. <dq>Then it's not a giant satellite?<dq></p><br>  <br>  <p><dq>Yes, it is. A satellite with a diameter of two to three thousand kilometers that is circling an enormous gas giant is one thing. That same satellite circling a small, rocky habitable planet is quite another. That satellite has a diameter over a quarter that of Earth. Where have you heard of such near-parity involving a habitable planet?<dq></p><br>  <br>  <p>Pelorat said timidly, <dq>I know very little of such things.<dq></p><br>  <br>  <p>Trevize said, <dq>Then take my word for it, Janov. It's unique. We're looking at something that is practically a double planet, and there are few habitable planets that have anything more than pebbles orbiting them. Janov, if you consider that gas giant with its enormous ring system in sixth place, and this planet with its enormous satellite in third—both of which your legends told you about, against all credibility, before you ever saw them-then that world you're looking at must be Earth.

"<p>Imagine a photon reaching the Hubble Space Telescope today had originally been emitted from a star in the early universe 13 billion years ago. Einstein’s Special Relativity tells us, traveling at the speed of light, that from the photon’s frame of reference, no time will have passed for the photon between the moment it was emitted from the star and the instant it was recorded by the Hubble telescope. In addition, at the speed of light, the length contraction (or Lorentz contraction) is said to shrink the distance between these two objects (the ancient star and the Hubble telescope) to zero. But herein lies the apparent paradox in two parts: 1) In the early universe 13 billion years ago when the star first emitted the photon, there was no Hubble Telescope for the photon to instantaneously collide with from its frame of reference. In other words, how can the photon instantly collide with something which won't be invented for 13 billion years? 2) Given the complete length contraction of all points in space to zero at the speed of light, how can a single photon ever be absorbed at <em>any one</em> particular point when, if all distance between points in the universe is zero from the photon’s frame of reference, the photon will hit <em>each and every point</em> throughout the universe simultaneously, not just one? </p><br><br><p>If you could help me understand this apparent paradox in laymen’s terms, it would be greatly appreciated.</p><br>","14264","2","14261","1"

Astronomers from the High-z Supernova Search Team and the Supernova Cosmology Project used ground-based telescopes and HST to observe distant supernovae and uncovered evidence that, far from decelerating under the influence of gravity, <strong>the expansion of the universe may in fact be accelerating</strong>. The cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood; the most common cause attributed is dark energy.</p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>I don't take this at face value because we should expect more distant objects to have higher <strong>observed</strong> speeds and therefore higher <strong>observed</strong> red-shifts.

An object 1,000 light years away, if it's light is reaching us now, is being observed in its state that existed 1,000 years ago. We are effectively looking through a time machine.</p></li><br><li><p>So if we observe a more distant object, we're observing an older state of that object. Therefore, we are observing it at a time when the Universe was expanding faster than it is now, so it has higher red-shifts.</p></li><br></ol><br><br><p>And isn't that what we observe today?

I would guess that given the outward pressure of solar wind and solar radiation, the direction of such material is generally outward, away from the sun. Well, where to? Media coverage of the departure of Voyager 1 from our solar system into the realm of interstellar space alerted me to the idea that there is an outer edge to solar influence, and I would guess that this is where the lighter molecules, like water and gases would tend to land. And indeed there is a collection of similar material out there at that solar radius.</p><br><br><p>Given these facts, is it accurate to view the Oort cloud as behaving similarly to a terrestrial cloudscape? Our clouds form at the altitude where water tends to deposit after it evaporates from the heated surface of the Earth. It gathers there and coalesces to a form which is then overcome by the opposing force of gravity. Then it returns from whence it came. Similarly, I imagine water and gases ultimately being driven from the heat of the sun to an “altitude above its surface”, where ultimately, over a much longer time scale, that material coalesces until other forces eventually drive them back toward the hot sun.

"<p>I realize this is kind of general as it would depend on the size of the white dwarf and the rate of accrual.    The general idea I got thinking about is what would happen if a white dwarf star - lets say 0.8 solar mass, well below Chandrasekhar was to accrue a bunch of hydrogen rather quickly.  I thought it might be get very hot and bright, perhaps similar to a red giant for a relatively brief period of time.</p><br><br><p>Mostly White dwarfs add mass by siphoning from the outer layer from a near by co-orbiting star, but I imagine, that mostly happens quite slowly, not fast enough to make the white dwarf shine like a main sequence star.  </p><br><br><p>Are there studies on how quickly mass can be added in this way and how bright it makes the white dwarf?  Does Hydrogen quickly fuse on the surface of a white dwarf or does it need to build up to a certain thickness first, perhaps creating a mini flash? or does the fusion happen rather quickly.</p><br><br><p>A very rough calculation, the escape velocity of a white dwarf, which would be similar to the terminal velocity of matter (mostly hydrogen) falling into it is about 5,500,000 meters/second for a 1 solar mass white dwarf.  <a href=<dq>http://www.astronomynotes.com/evolutn/s13.htm<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>Source</a>. </p><br><br><p>The velocity needed for hydrogen fusion is about 20,000,000 meters per second.  <a href=<dq>http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/01/nuclear-fusion/<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>Source</a> (under the what makes fusion hard section).   So, white dwarf's aren't massive enough to create fusion upon impact, but the high density and high heat of impact seems like it could create fusion relatively quickly as matter builds up around them, perhaps creating something that perhaps glows like a star and expands rather rapidly - assuming there's a sustained burn and not a kind of very quick explosion of sorts.   I think it could glow very hot and perhaps expand rather large, but I'm just kind of guessing.</p><br><br><p>If a white dwarf was to crash into, say, a brown dwarf or very low mass star, hydrogen rich, say about .1 solar mass?   Such a brown dwarf would be much larger than the white dwarf but also quite a bit lighter, probably light enough to get penetrated completely though the impact would also likely create fusion and it's difficult for me to imagine what would happen with so violent a crash.   It seems to me that the density of the white dwarf, if it could retain most of the matter from the brown dwarf would be sufficient that you'd be left with a fast burning light weight fusion star, with a very dense core.   This might be an impossible question, but how quickly would a .8 solar mass white dwarf consume the hydrogen from a .1 solar mass brown dwarf, should this rare kind of collision happen.   Would it actually form a star-like object for a period of time, say a million years or so, or would the enormous energy of impact basically blow it apart no new star?  Perhaps a near miss and an inside the Roche limit approach would be better than a direct impact for new star formation.</p><br><br><p>Thanks.</p><br>","18332","1"

"<p>My question is about the <a href=<dq>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/812/1/8/pdf<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>journal paper</a> mentioned in <a href=<dq>http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/58502/journal-paper-and-conference-proceedings-note-appear-to-be-identical-is-this-pl<dq>>an Academia Stack Exchange post</a>. Please understand that this paper has never been posted on arXiv, and I can provide only a link whose content is behind a paywall.</p><br><br><p><strong>Summary of my question:</strong> it boils down to <dq>whether a spatial coordinate of a fiducial observer can have a nonzero partial derivative with respect to the coordinate time.<dq></p><br><br><p>I am interested in the validity of the central result of this paper. It is Eq. 4.24, which reads<br>\begin{equation}<br>\begin{split}<br>&amp;\nabla\cdot\left[\frac{\alpha}{\varpi^{2}}\left\{1-\left(\frac{\omega-\Omega^{F}}{\alpha}\varpi\right)^{2}\right\}\nabla\Psi\right]<br>- \frac{\omega-\Omega_{F}}{\alpha}\nabla\Omega^{F}\cdot\nabla\Psi\\<br>&amp;+ \frac{4\pi\dot{\varpi}}{\alpha^{2}\varpi}\left(1-\frac{\dot{\Phi}}{4\pi}\right)\frac{\partial \Omega^{F}}{\partial z} + 4\pi \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left[\frac{\dot{\varpi}}{\alpha\varpi}\frac{\omega-\Omega^{F}}{\alpha}\left(1-\frac{\dot{\Phi}}{4\pi}\right)\right]\\<br>&amp;+\frac{1}{\alpha\varpi^{2}}\left[\left(\frac{\dot{\alpha}}{\alpha}+\frac{\dot{\varpi}}{\varpi}\right)\dot{\Psi}-\ddot{\Psi}\right] + \frac{\dot{\varphi}}{\varpi}\frac{\omega-\Omega^{F}}{\alpha}\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial\varpi}\\<br>&amp;-\frac{16\pi^{2}\xi}{\varpi^{2}}\left(1-\frac{\dot{\Phi}}{4\pi}\right) = 0,<br>\end{split}<br>\end{equation}<br>where a dot on top of a symbol denotes a <strong>partial</strong> derivative with respect to the coordinate time $t$.</p><br><br><p>The above partial differential equation is supposed to describe the magnetosphere of a Kerr black hole. The authors use the spherical coordinates $(r,\theta,\varphi)$ and define $\varpi$ as follows:<br>\begin{equation}<br>\varpi \equiv \frac{\Sigma}{\rho}\sin\theta,<br>\end{equation}<br>where<br>\begin{equation}<br>\rho^{2} \equiv r^{2} + a^{2}\cos^{2}\theta,<br>\end{equation}<br>\begin{equation}<br>\Sigma^{2} \equiv (r^{2}+a^{2})^{2}- a^{2}\Delta\sin^{2}\theta,<br>\end{equation}<br>and<br>\begin{equation}<br>\Delta \equiv r^{2} + a^{2} - 2Mr.<br>\end{equation}<br>Note also that $\alpha$ is the lapse function defined as<br>\begin{equation}<br>\alpha\equiv \frac{\rho}{\Sigma}\sqrt{\Delta}.<br>\end{equation}</p><br><br><p>The functions $\Psi(t,\textbf{r})$ and $\Phi(t,\textbf{r})$ denote the magnetic and electric fluxes through an $\textbf{m}$-loop passing through $\textbf{r}$, where $\textbf{m} \equiv \varpi\hat{e}_{\varphi}$ is the Killing vector associated with axisymmetry.</p><br><br><p>What confuses me is the following: $\varpi$, $\varphi$, and $\alpha$ are simply spatial coordinates or combinations thereof, and their (partial) time derivatives should all be identically equal to zero because space and time coordinates are independent variables. This would render many parts of Eq. 4.24 nothing but convoluted ways to express the number zero.</p><br><br><p>I have also tried to follow the derivation of Eq. 4.24, and figured out that the authors implicitly assumed the following relations:<br>\begin{equation}<br>\dot{\Phi} = \dot{\varpi}\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial \varpi}<br>\end{equation}<br>and<br>\begin{equation}<br>\dot{\Psi} = \dot{\varpi}\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial \varpi}.<br>\end{equation}<br>Recall that a dot means a partial derivative with respect to time. As $\dot{\varpi}$ is identically zero, the above relations seem to be wrong.</p><br><br><p>However, what makes me somewhat unsure about my conclusion is that this paper is published in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>, a renowned peer-reviewed journal in astrophysics.

If any matter were to actually fall into a black hole, it seems like it would need to gain infinite energy.</p><br><br><p>This is seen by considering an object close to the event horizon of a black hole. If we consider escape velocity for a particle at the event horizon, it has an escape velocity of the speed of light. The energy required to achieve this escape velocity would therefore be infinite. As we approach the event horizon, it seems like we should be able, then, to define an arbitrarily small distance across which the particle gains an arbitrary amount of energy. </p><br><br><p>As the object approaches arbitrarily close to the event horizon, it seems like its relativistic mass would therefore grow arbitrarily high, resulting in a corresponding increase in the gravity of the black hole, which seems impossible.</p><br><br><p>If we extrapolate back to the formation of the black hole, it then seems like it should be impossible for any particles to fall into the black hole, even as it forms. Instead, mass should be distributed in a probability cloud whose density asymptotically approaches zero at the event horizon of the black hole. New particles could then enter this cloud of incredibly dense (but not black hole dense) matter, where they would be captured rather than falling past the event horizon, within which there would be a vacuum.</p><br><br><p>If this were true, there would be no black holes, only hollow spheres of radiation and matter which externally look like black holes, since their gravity would be great enough that particles entering the sphere would exit at an incredibly slow rate. Interestingly, such spheres wouldn't suffer from the apparent information paradox that black holes do.</p><br><br><p>That or I'm missing an obvious explanation for why that's all wrong, which seems more likely because I'm neither a physicist nor an astronomer.

"<p>Accretion discs are ubiquitous in astrophisics. As a direct corollary, they are important for the following question.</p><br><br><p>Consider the following model, representing one of the most simple models for accretion discs. A central object is a star (pre-MS, WD or NS, but not a BH) of mass $M$, surrounded by a thin flat disc of material, which continuosly feeds the star at a rate $\dot{M}$, such that $M/\dot{M}$ is much larger than thermal and dynamical timescale of the star (i.e. accretion rate is slow).</p><br><br><p>Everywhere in the accretion disc its local motion is nearly circular and nearly Keplerian. Therefore, at the interface of the star and the disc the disc will always tend to make the star rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities. From the other hand, if the stellar outer parts were to rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities, these parts would become gravitationaly detached from the star, which would have significant consequences for the stellar shape and structure. Surely, though, the process is going to be slow and the acquired angular momentum will be redistributed within the star.</p><br><br><p>Now the question: <strong>What will be happening to the star if it approaches nearly break-up velocities due to such a spin-up?</strong> This involves a few subquestions: How close the rotation rate can actually get to the critical one? If it can get close enough, how would the whole process look like? That is, what would happen in the short term to the star when the effects of rotation will start to affect its structure? What would happen to the star in the long term?</p><br><br><p>I would like to keep this problem as a purely hydrodynamical one. That is, assume, that the only laws involved are hydrodynamical and gravitational ones, with some constant accretion rate supported. In reality magnetic fields would also play an important role for some stars, and stellar winds could also possibly be important.</p><br><br><p>Examples of the decribed systems are numerous.

From the distant vantage point of Kepler, the spacecraft could observe the comet's core and tail. The long-range global view of Kepler complements the close-in view of the Rosetta spacecraft, providing context for the high-resolution investigation Rosetta performed as it descended closer and closer to the comet.</p><br>  <br>  <p>During the two-week period of study, Kepler took a picture of the comet every 30 minutes. The animation shows a period of 29.5 hours of observation from Sept. 17 through Sept. 18.

"<p>Determining effective temperature of a star is in general a non-trivial task. Simple reason for this is that we can only study the electromagnetic radiation from a star, but not the temperature directly. The complexity is due to the fact that the radiation is produced in stratified stellar atmospheres, which are only partially characterised by stellar temperature, but also by many other factors, such as stellar mass, elemental abundances, stellar rotation, etc. What is more, the temperature of atmospheres varies with depth, whereas effective temperature is just a number.</p><br><br><p>From the other hand, temperatures and magnitudes are the most important quantities, characterising stars.</p><br><br><p><strong>So, the question</strong>: How exactly does one use the spectrum to extract the information about the temperature of a star?

First what Meeus calls the <dq>instant of the 'mean<dq> equinox or solstice<dq> is calculated using a fourth degree polynomial; there are 8 expressions. There are different expressions for each solstice or equinox, and different expressions for the year ranges -1000 to 1000 vs. 1000 to 3000.

"<p>This is a question, where I start with some assertions:</p><br><br><p>Try to consider the universe as a four-coordinate system, x,y,z,t where t is time and where we view a change in t as a change in position, and as a velocity in the same way as any other change in either of the other components of the coordinate. Everything is then moving at the speed of c. The difference between a photon and another particle would be that a photon <dq>spends<dq> its velocity in any of the x, y or z dimensions - but not in the time dimension.</p><br><br><p>This implies that all photons are on the same coordinate in the t-dimension - only the x,y,z values change while t remains 0. It also implies that time would appear to stop for something travelling in only the other dimensions, while it would pass fastest for something completely stationary.</p><br><br><p>You can then also consider space-time as a function of acceleration.

"<p>A telescope located in the gravitational focus of the Sun can use the Sun as a magnifying lens. The focus begins 550 AU away, but maybe a 700 or 1000 AU distance is needed to get rid of disturbances from the Corona, and the focus extends practically indefinately. Here are some slides by Dr. Maccone who has promoted this idea he calls FOCAL:<br><a href=<dq>http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf</a></p><br><br><p>I intend to ask about the technical design and feasibility of such a project in the Space Exploration SE. Here I rather ask about the scientific value and challenges.</p><br><br><p>POINTING: The magnification would occur only in the exact direction of the Sun. But since the Sun moves and the background objects magnified move, I suppose that the observed targets would change continuously. Would it even be practically possible to give the telescope a trajectory which keeps it aiming at for example Alpha Centauri? Would there most of the time be nothing in the right direction as the line between the telescope and the Sun sweeps across space, or would there alway be some star or galaxy in sight? Like CMB if nothing else.</p><br><br><p>GAIN: In the slides linked above, Maccone has calculated the expected gain to 114 dB for infrared wavelengths. How many times <dq>magnification<dq> does this mean? I don't think I understand the units here, I get a ridiculously large number. Can it be explained somewhat intuitively? Would a FOCAL mission be a unique revolution in astronomy, or could similar results be achieved by building an interferometer with interplanetary sized baselines here nearer to the Sun? How does the science value of a gravity lens compare to that of a wide baseline? Are they good for different tasks?</p><br><br><p>DISTORTIONS: Could the lensed signals be reconstructed thanks to our knowledge of the Sun and measurements of corona activity? If pointed towards a central part of the Milky Way, wouldn't signals come from multiple objects at the same time, some much further away than others? Would the gravity lens of the Sun have bigger problems with distortion than the intergalactic gravity lenses we know of today?</p><br><br><p>And finally, can any natural strong lensing inside the Milky Way be used today, for example using a globular cluster as a lens?</p><br>","2123","2"

From the disk itself.<br>  All gas in the Universe is magnetized, at least a little bit, and the [accretion] disk's gas is no exception.

In a Q&amp;A session, a listener had asked what would happen if Superman really did stop the earth from rotating and rotated it in the other direction. Prof. Tyson's response was that if the earth, which is rotating at approx. 1000mph about its axis, is stopped, everything that is not anchored on earth will move the opposite direction at 1000mph and we'd all go crashing into things at that speed.</p><br><br><p>I suppose that is just simple inertia: if a body moving at 1000mph is stopped abruptly, everything that was moving with it but not attached to it would indeed attempt to continue in the same direction at 1000mph. However, the earth is <em>rotating</em> rather than moving in a straight line. Essentially, gravity is strong enough to ensure that we are not thrown off into space by the centrifugal force from the earth's rotation (we aren't holding on to our dear lives as the earth turns at 1000mph). So in a sense, aren't we <em>anchored</em> to earth by gravity? And therefore, doesn't it mean that if the earth stopped abruptly, we'd just stop with it? (I'm thinking of say a centrifuge with test tubes attached to it. Though as I think about this, I feel that we'd sway at the point of attachment instead of stand still, were the earth to stop).</p><br><br><p>Can someone help resolve this for me?</p><br>","1684","3","1687","2"

"<p>Please forgive my ignorance, I am not an astronomer, just an interested layman.</p><br><br><p>The further away a galaxy is from us, the faster it is moving away from us.

"<p>I'm working on a game concept that does some mild simulation of realistic stellar classes and luminosities.

Still, I could write some code to parse the values in that field to try to get a rough count of luminosity categories in those roughly 116,000 stars... but I'm a little perplexed that no such chart appears to exist already somewhere in Internetland. (Either that or my search-fu is weaker than usual.)</p><br><br><p>If anyone can point me to a chart of the frequency distribution for the luminosity categories noted above, or suggest a reasonably simple way for me to calculate those values myself, I'd appreciate it.</p><br><br><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Out of curiosity, I went ahead and did my own simple parsing of the spectrum fields from the Hipparcos dataset.</p><br><br><p>Out of 116472 rows, only 56284 (fewer than half) provided luminosity class data in the Spectrum field.

But how can the other end of the black hole let space <dq>escape<dq> in order to complete the motion? </p></li><br></ol><br><br><p>I am pretty sure I am just missing something here, because as I have learned, black holes have been found in galaxies and solar systems and many other places where they have to be moving.

And along those lines, it seems amazing to me that a black hole could be in essence a kind of scar in spacetime that can also move through it.</p><br><br><p>Thanks for any help and sorry for the wordy question. </p><br><br><p>UPDATE: Thanks for the answers so far.

But on the other hand, Dr. Hamilton describes a flow of spacetime between the event horizon and the inner horizon, and he says it is plausible that within that area, space itself (which has no substance, in his words) can be described as flowing in and being flung back out. </p><br><br><p>I don't understand how space can have these two opposing properties - (1) a curvature that is maintained in order for the black hole to exist, that is, a curvature generated because matter can interact with the space and (2) a flow of space that sounds like it is not subject to a restriction of crossing back out of the event horizon.</p><br><br><p>It's that apparent difference between (1) and (2) that I want to understand better.</p><br><br><p>Thanks!</p><br>","10086","3","10090","1"

"<p>I've had a dobsonian telescope for a while now, but I've never been able to collimate  it. I thought I had it collimated once, but when I looked through it the star didn't look right, it looked kind of like a round disc with a hole in the middle.

"<p>It is believed that dark matter is made of particles, which interact with matter only weakly and gravitationally. One common candidate for dark matter are so called <a href=<dq>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle<dq>>WIMPs</a>. WIMPs, specifically, are heavy and may be their own antiparticles.</p><br><br><p>And as any other particles dark matter particles can be produced at sufficiently high energies. The mass of dark matter particles is unknown, but is estimated to be of order $1$-$100 \textrm{GeV}$, which corresponds to temperatures of $T_{DM}\approx 10^{13}$-$10^{15}\textrm{K}$, at which these particles may be expected to be produced.</p><br><br><p>Such enormous temperatures are barely attainable in any reasonable astrophysical processes, but say in core-collapse supernovae newly formed core has temperatures of $T_{SN,after}\approx 10^{11}\textrm{K}$, and probably more during the collapse phase. Then a crude estimate would suggest that the amount of dark matter produced is $M_{DM}\approx e^{-T_{DM}/T_{SN,max}}M_\odot$. Or, in number form $\log_{10}(M_{DM}/\textrm{kg})=30.3-0.43(T_{DM}/T_{SN})$. This means that at $T_{SN}=1.4\cdot 10^{-2}T_{DM}$ the amount of dark matter produced during a supernova will be around one kilogram. Such temperatures are fairly reachable for $1 \textrm{GeV}$ DM particles. So one can optimistically expect few kilograms of dark matter produced per supernova.</p><br><br><p>Now the question. <strong>What is a typical dark matter production in core-collapse supernovae?</strong> A good answer, I imagine, would be a more robust expansion on the existing estimate.

"<p>I understand that astronomers once thought that the material in the disc of a galaxy was moving around the galactic centre (where most of the mass was thought to be) in roughly circular orbits. The circular motions would be explained by the combination of inertia and gravitational acceleration towards the centre. This follows the Kepler/Newton model which describes/explains the orbits of planets around the Sun.  In a Kepler/Newton system the tangential or transverse velocity of a low-mass orbitting object depends on the radial distance of the high-mass object from the centre.  Objects further out must have lower velocities so that the weaker centrally-directed acceleration at that distance can keep the object moving in a roughly circular track. </p><br><br><p>In the centre of the galaxy the velocities are low and increase rapidly with distance away from the centre.  This is understandable as the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy  is not concentrated at the centre, it is spread out over a relatively large volume.  </p><br><br><p>However it is now well-known that the measured velocities of visible material in the disks of discoidal galaxies do not vary as expected for a Kepler/Newton system.

"<p>A tidal day is the MEAN time between successive meridian transits of the Moon. (This is sometimes called called a lunar day, a term that should be deprecated for use in this sense, because it is also used for the length of a day on the Moon and should be reserved for the latter meaning to avoid ambiguity.) Its length exceeds a mean solar day of 24 hours by X minutes, which is also the (mean) time-length by which moonrise (or its meridian transit) is later each day than it was yesterday.

However, I cannot find anywhere an authoritative source detailing the <dq>correct<dq> way to calculate X.</p><br><br><p>Does anyone know of an authoritative method of calculating X, and/or can anyone comment on the three methods given below.</p><br><br><p>(1) I have a personal theory that puts X at about 48.763 minutes, but I am uneasy about how correct the underlying logic of it is, which is this:</p><br><br><p>Consider two successive conjunctions (C1 and C2) of the MEAN sun and MEAN moon. At C1, the Sun's azimuth and the Moon's azimuth will, at ALL places on Earth, be the same, and, although this is no longer true for the rest of the lunation, it will once again be true at C2. This is analogous to two clocks: Clock 1 (the MEAN sun) keeps correct time, while clock 2 (the MEAN moon) loses a constant amount of time (X minutes) each day. Since the two clocks agree at C1 and at C2, clock 2 must have lost exactly 24 hours (1440 minutes) during the intervening synodic lunation, whose length (Ln) is 29.5305891203704 days. This suggests that X (the number of minutes that clock 2 loses per day) = (1440 / Ln) = 48.763.</p><br><br><p>However, I feel uneasy about this logic for this reason: If C1 occurs on April 1 at 06:00:00, UTC, and it is then sunrise at Tema, Ghana (on the prime meridian, near the equator), C2 will be on April 30 at 18:44:03, UTC, and that will not be sunrise at Tema; it will be dusk there, and it will be sunrise at east longitude 169°.</p><br><br><p>Does this negate the above logic suggesting that X = 24 hours / Ln?</p><br><br><p>(2) Another method for calculating X suggested to me is this:</p><br><br><p>It is based on the Moon's sidereal period (Ld), 27.321661 days. The MEAN angular distance along its orbit travelled by the Moon each day is (360° / Ld) = 13.17636° (which equates to a mean orbital speed of about 0.55° per hour.) So, each day, the Earth must rotate 360° plus an extra 13.17636° to point the same meridian back at the Moon again. The Earth's rotational speed is (360° / 24 hrs) = 15° per hour. At that rate, the extra time needed by the Earth to rotate those extra 13.17636° is [(13.17636/360) * 24] = 0.878424 hour = 52.7 minutes.</p><br><br><p>(3) I argue that even if method (2) is right in principle, it requires two amendments, because:</p><br><br><p>(a) The Earth rotates 360° in a sidereal day, which is nearly 4 minutes shorter than 24 hours, in which time the Earth rotates nearly 361°, or, more precisely, 360.98565°. (The fraction in the latter value is obtained from the average daily portion of the Earth's orbit: 360°/365.2422 days = 0.985647° per day.) (An animation demonstrating why this is so is <a href=<dq>http://moongazer.x10.mx/website/astronomy/downloads.htm#solarVsidereal<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow noreferrer<dq>>here</a>.) So, the extra time needed by the Earth to rotate those extra 13.17636° is:</p><br><br><p>[(13.17636/360.98565)*24] = 0.8760 hours = 52.56 minutes.</p><br><br><p>(b) Furthermore, in those extra 52.56 minutes, the Moon has moved on in its orbit by nearly another half a degree. More precisely, it is (360/27.321661)*(52.56/1440) = 0.48094°. So the calculation should be:</p><br><br><p>[(13.17636+0.48094)/360.98565)*24] = 0.90800 hours = 54.48 minutes. </p><br><br><p>So we have three different methods of calculating X, yielding values of 48.763, 52.56 or 54.48 minutes.</p><br><br><p>Comments anyone?

Would we be able to look at the way the Sun wobbles and determine how many planets were in orbit around our Sun, or would we only be able to say that there was one, or simply that there may be several? I guess, the root question is how accurately can we judge the contents of a star system based on the perturbations in the star's orbit?

I would expect that would affect calculations for things like how much 'missing' matter there was.</p><br><br><p>To try to further clarify this second question, simplifying things to 3 points on a triangle... if we're at A and we observe points B and C which are X billion light years apart, then the effect of gravity on the speed of B and C moving apart would have been greater in the past when they were closer together and furthermore the effects of the current gravitational force will take more than X billion years to reach the other object. As far as I understand, dark matter is a way to account for observed gravitational effects that can't be accounted for in other ways.

After calculating sky glow the device would add it to a plot that shows how sky glow varies throughout the year, and creates a nightly twitter post rating the night for Astronomy.

I am not sure what factors are important in this decision at all. Also, once the camera is set up, what would be the best process for calibrating it to get values that agree most closely with accepted ones?

"<p>I was wondering if there could theoretically exist systems in which an Earth-like planet was in the habitable zone of one (or two) Sun-like star(s), while actually not orbiting around any star.<br>To be more precise, I started asking myself whether a planet like earth could be placed in the inner orbit of a black hole, while one or a pair of Suns would be revolving around the black hole too, on an outer orbit.</p><br><br><p>My question is not whether such a system could actually exist somewhere, but only if it could <em>theoretically</em> exist, even if it is probabilistically not likely to exist.</p><br><br><p>So I found this sets of issues:</p><br><br><ol><br><li>Planet must be far enough from the black hole ( > Roche Limit )</li><br><li>Harmful radiations from black hole's accretion disk</li><br><li>Planet-Star relative distance must not vary too much ...which I guess in turn means that the planet-blackhole distance must be small compared to the average blackhole-star distance</li><br></ol><br><br><p>Given these limitations, how would you choose the stars and blackhole masses and their relative distances to the planet, in order to have it suitable for complex, perhaps intelligent forms of life? Do you see other issues to this purpose?</p><br><br><p>Below I add what I've been able to collect so far (more like a collection of unsolved questions..)</p><br><br><p>So, about the issue #1, I thought about a rather lightweight blackhole, with M &lt; 10 Solar masses. I once read in a thread that when considering a central body = 10 solar masses, and a satellite with a density of 5000 kg/m^3 (Earth's average density), then the Roche Limit would be as little as 0.8<percent> of an AU . That would be conveniently small, though I guessed that using Earth's average density may not guarantee that the whole planet is kept together (it may lose its atmosphere...). So, just to be sure, would you rather increase this distance to 1/20 of an AU, perhaps less, perhaps more? I'm asking here because Im not able to conduct these calculation myself. </p><br><br><p>Then again, Im not an expert and I don't know if staying out of the Roche Limit is a sufficient condition for orbiting around a blackhole of this small size without things becoming nasty. I know of issue #2 though,and about that I read someone suggesting that If the planet were subjected to tidal lock, then at least the face looking away from the blackhole would be spared from the harming X rays. But how close a planet should get to a blackhole in order to experience a tidal lock within a reasonable amount of time? Would it likely be tidally locked if it stayed at 0.05 AU away from a 10 solar masses black hole? I guess the answer to be yes, but I wanted some validations from the experts here.</p><br><br><p>Then about issue #3 again, I thought that If there were two Suns (making another binary system of their own), then there would be also a larger insulating flux, perhaps allowing us to keep the Suns more far away (by a quick calculation I think i found that two Suns at 1.4 AU would give the same flux as one Sun at 1 AU). Another possibility is to have a brighter Star class, at expense of its life-time. So for simplicity let's say we can go up to 2 AU (maybe even more) without the Planet getting too cold, or the Stars too short-lived.</p><br><br><p>Summarizing, I now have a 10 Solar Masses black hole and a (likely) tidally locked earth-like planet orbiting at 0.05 AU from it.Tidal forces should still be small enough not to suck the planet's atmosphere. Perhaps having a planet slightly bigger than the Earth would also help in this account. Then we have a couple of Stars orbiting together around the black hole, at a distance of 2 AU. Relative distance from the twin Stars to the Planet is 2 +/- 0.05 AU. I guess that would be within the limits of the habitable zone, right?</p><br><br><p>One last curiosity: assuming the black hole has an <dq>average<dq> spin, would it be realistic if the two Stars had a tilted orbit with respect to the black hole spinning axis?</p><br><br><p>I'm sorry for the many questions, by any means please don't assume I'm expecting a single person to answer all of them. Well, at least I dont expect to be that lucky :) . Thank you all</p><br>","18278","1","18277","0"

In a Newtonian central-force elliptical-orbit model the addition of an extra centre-directed acceleration ($dV/dt$), which varies through the orbit as $(+3 V_t^2/c^2\,\equiv \, +3 h^2/r^2c^2)$ times the co-temporal standard Newtonian centre-directed gravitational acceleration, can be shown (by first order perturbation analysis or numerical modelling) to produce apsidal precession at a rate (radians per orbit) defined by a Newtonian formula $$\epsilon = 24 \pi^3 \frac{a^2}{T^2 c^2(1-e^2)}$$ .  This formula is well-known (see for example <a href=<dq>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>Wikipedia Apsidal precession</a>). According to, but not clearly referenced by, <a href=<dq>http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath527/kmath527.htm<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>this article</a>, the formula (or an algebraic equivalent using other terms) was well known c. 1895 (i.e. <em>before</em> the publications of Gerber 1898 and Einstein 1915).

These are claims I find impossible to believe.  </p><br><br><p>A simple application of, for instance, the Raleigh Criterion ($\theta = 1.22~\lambda/D$), where $\theta$ is the angular resolution of the telescope, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light in question, and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope, would show that a comparison between angular resolutions is as simple as comparing the diameters of the telescope apertures.  Hubble's mirror is 2.4 m; comparing with the 24.5 m GMT and the 30 m TMT we see that the GMT will have 10.2 times the angular resolution of Hubble, while the TMT will have 12.5 times the angular resolution of Hubble.  I think a calculation similar to the one I have described is how the article linked above came up with the numbers they did about the angular resolution of these telescopes compared to Hubble. </p><br><br><p>However, the Raleigh criterion only applies to telescopes working at their diffraction limit.  Space telescopes (if they're designed well and built correctly) can work close to the diffraction limit (maybe even at the diffraction limit).  Ground-based telescopes, however, are limited in angular resolution by the atmosphere, which at best will limit resolution to about an arc-second at the best sites on Earth. Thus the GMT and TMT by themselves will <strong>not</strong> have better image resolution than Hubble.</p><br><br><p><strong>My question, then, is whether this article is correct (possibly because of one of the reasons I list below) or whether it seems this article naively applied the Raleigh Criterion for angular resolution with no thought about how the atmosphere will affect the resolving capabilities of these large ground-based telescopes.</strong></p><br><br><p>Possible reasons the article may still be correct:</p><br><br><ul><br><li>Adaptive optics, a developing technology which can allow telescopes to correct for distortions to the image produced by the atmosphere.

The paper suggests that these stars form from Population III stars.</p><br><br><p>What's more, while almost all of the star's luminosity is from the accretion disk (which is far more luminous than thermonuclear reactions), temperatures around the central black hole are hot enough for fusion:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>Although we do not model the non-hydrostatic region of quasi-stars in any detail, in our case high temperatures <em>are</em> attained in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. However, even in this region the neglect of nuclear reactions is justified, first because black hole accretion is energetically much more efficient than fusion, and secondly because on-going accretion limits the time-scale over which inflowing gas is exposed to high $T$.</p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>That's all fine, but what surprised me is the footnote on the third page:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>In the most massive quasi-stars, the central temperature may be high enough (a few million K) to initiate lithium burning.

Considering that these form from Population III stars, how is it that much lithium burning can happen in the first place?</p><br><br><p>Although lithium is a relatively light atom, it is considered a metal and lithium burning depletes the amount of lithium in a star.

"<p>According to modern cosmology, space is expanding, causing proper distances (but not comoving distances) to increase between galaxies. In the Big Crunch hypothesis, gravity halts and reverses the expansion of the Universe, causing all matter to collide and eventually form a single black hole. This gives way to other oscillating universe hypotheses, which generally propose that the conditions in a compressed Universe would be the same as those during the Big Bang, leading a cycle of expanding and contracting universes.</p><br><br><p>Ignoring the <a href=<dq>https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/13615/are-there-any-studies-that-prove-disprove-the-oscillating-universe-theory/18569#18569<dq>>problems with entropy</a> in reverting the Universe to Big Bang conditions, how can gravity be the cause of a Big Crunch in the first place?

Is this actually the case?</p><br><br><p>If not, the gravitating objects should be moving through a comoving coordinate system, so space itself would not actually be contracting. As far as I can tell, we would have all the Universe's matter compressed within a single point in space, instead of space itself contracting.

If this is in fact what the Big Crunch hypothesis describes, than I'm utterly confused as to how an oscillating universe could work in such a situation.</p><br><br><p>Am I mistaken, or do the Big Crunch and oscillating universe hypotheses imply that gravity actually contracts space (as in, the comoving distances of gravitationally attracting objects would not change)?

What happened before the big bang according to these scientists? And this big bang theory came from scientists thinking that the universe expands so if we reverse the time, it will do the opposite and come to one single point....but then if it did come from a point, I found that the expansion is INCREASING which is weird. How on earth can it be a blast , because obv like any blast it should decreases and come to a hault , here instead of the universe expansion decelerating its actually accelerating.

So this brought my mind a new question, if scientists still cant understand what has happens in the big bang , how can they tell that God doesnt exist, and stuff like that and make them appear as facts, if they knew the physics at the big bang and talked then its fine, but here they are talking without even knowing those.</p><br><br><p>Source: <a href=<dq>http://srilanka.answercup.com/question/215/how-can-i-convince-my-atheist-friend-that-god-exists/<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>http://srilanka.answercup.com/question/215/how-can-i-convince-my-atheist-friend-that-god-exists/</a></p><br>","6044","5"

The complete package includes a sturdy metal tripod, a red dot viewfinder, two 1.25 inch eyepieces and a star diagonal, and a software DVD with instructional video. The NG60-SM Refractor Telescope comes disassembled in a compact box, but the instructional DVD video guides you through all the steps required for assembly. Go ahead and try it out in the daytime, that's the best time to align the red-dot finder scope while looking at a distant tree or telephone pole. The optics of Meade's NG60-SM produce an image that is right side up but the diagonal mirror reverses the image left-to-right. That's no problem most of the time, but an optional correct image diagonal is available. The low power 25mm eyepiece produces a magnification 28X which is just right for spotting the Moon or the planets, while the 9mm eyepiece (78X magnification) can be used to zoom in for more detail. The MH25 eyepiece at 28X shows a lovely view of the Lunar disk in a dark sky, while the MH9 eyepiece at 78X shows literally hundreds of craters on the Moon and begins to show the rings of Saturn and the cloud bands of Jupiter. For even better views it's easy to add better eyepieces. My best view of Saturn, for example, came with an optional 6.4mm Super Plossl eyepiece, about 110X magnification. The Altazimuth mount included with Meade's NG60-SM is lighter and easier to use than an Equatorial mount, yet the slow motion knobs make it easy to keep objects in view. The rotation of the Earth causes the Moon or planets to appear to drift out of the eyepiece, but the slow motion knobs make it easy to keep the telescope on target, even with a high power eyepiece. The telescope is sensitive to vibration, however, so a high power eyepiece can be difficult to focus.</p><br><br><p>So which 1 is best?????</p><br><br><p>I wanna see Saturn its rings,Jupiter and its moons,mars,venus, basically planets and their moons</p><br>","14069","1"

This way, the definition specifies  $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ through $L=4\pi \sigma R^2 T_{\textrm{eff}}^4$, where $\sigma$ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. </p><br><br><p>The definition clearly alludes to black-body law. Many stars, including our own Sun, have a spectrum that does not follow it. For this reason, one often talks about another effective temperature, which is the temperature of stellar material at photospheric radius, and which can be determined by examining stellar spectrum. There are a few more complications to that, but let's put them aside.</p><br><br><p>Determining  $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ is extremely important in characterising stars, therefore there exists a variety of methods of measuring it, and naturally researchers strive for obtaining the best possible precision.</p><br><br><p>Hence, the question: <strong>How well can one in principle measure $T_{\textrm{eff}}$, if one could have arbitrarily perfect instruments?</strong> </p><br><br><p>Edit: <strong>I would like to see a quantitative estimate in your answer. Is the best possible precision for $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ of order $10\textrm{K}$, or is it $1\textrm{K}$, or some $10^{-4}\textrm{K}$, or can we measure it arbitrarily well?</strong></p><br><br><p>Here are just a few sources of uncertainty/arbitrariness: convection in stars, dependence of photospheric radius on wavelength, limb darkening, stellar variability, to name a few.</p><br><br><p>I would encourage the answers to be in the format <dq>Source of uncertainty<dq> - <dq>Simple derivation<dq> - <dq>Estimate of the effect<dq>. If there are more than a few estimates, I will add a summary of them in the question or in a separate reply.

In general, the winds are isotropic, and so emission is assumed to be spherically symmetric neglecting rotational effects.

Simulations place most of the emissions in a rather narrow spot near the star, because while there are indeed high temperatures experienced all along a beam extending outward from the star, the density quickly falls off, as shown in Figure 4:</p><br><br><p><a href=<dq>https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5HQa.png<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow noreferrer<dq>><img src=<dq>https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5HQa.png<dq> alt=<dq>enter image description here<dq>></a><br><br><br><sup>From left to right: Logarithmic density, logarithmic temperature, and x-ray emission.</sup></p><br><br><p>Why does the density drop off so quickly?

The GR potential $V_{GR}$ is given by<br>$$V = -\frac{GMm}{r} -\frac{b}{r^3}$$<br>where $m$ is the target body mass and $b$ is a constant (Goldstein uses $h$ instead of $b$, see below, but I have already used $h$ to mean something different in Walter above,)<br><p> differentiating the potential with respect to distance $r$ to give force we derive<br>$$F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3b}{r^4}$$<br><p>Now Goldstein defines the constant $b$ thus :-<br>$$<br>b = \frac{k\,l^2}{m^2c^2} \qquad\text{ Goldstein eqtn [12.48]} <br>$$<br>where<br>$$<br>k=GMm <br>$$<br>and <br>$$<br>l^2 = mka(1-e^2) \qquad\text{ Goldstein eqtn[12.50]}<br>$$</p><br><br><p>So</p><br><br><p>$$b = \frac{GMm\, m\, GMm\, a(1-e^2)}{m^2c^2}<br>= \frac{GMm \, L^2}{c^2}<br>= \frac{GMm \,m^2 v_c^2 a^2}{c^2}<br>$$</p><br><br><p>So the GR force equation becomes<br>$$<br>F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm m^2 v_c^2 a^2}{r^4c^2}<br>$$<br>substituting $a$ by $r$ we get<br>$$<br>F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm m^2 v_c^2}{r^2c^2}<br>= \frac{GMm}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{3 v_c^2 \, m^2}{c^2} \right)<br>$$</p><br><br><p>So the Newtonian:GR ratio derived from Goldstein is the same as the ratio derived by Walter except that the former has the additional term of $m^2$ in the numerator.<br>Even if we tried to fudge this numerically by invoking a unit mass target, it would still be dimensionally incorrect.<br><p> So what is the correct ratio?<br>$$$$<br><p>UPDATE ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br><p>In the refactoring of $b$ I used angular momentum $L$ when I should have used specific angular momentum $\mathfrak{l}$.

"<p>In anticipation of the upcoming <a href=<dq>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2014_lunar_eclipse<dq>>April 2014 lunar eclipse</a>, I decided to use the 3D virtual planetarium software <a href=<dq>http://www.stellarium.org/<dq>>Stellarium</a> to simulate what it is supposed look like where I live, since I've never actually witnessed an actual eclipse before. I set the clock to begin at the moonrise before the beginning of the event and to tick at a rate of a few virtual-minutes per real-second, pressed play, and waited for the eclipse to begin. When it did, I saw something I did not expect. To be honest, I realized my expectations were embarrassingly naïve.</p><br><br><p>I watched the Moon rise in the east and begin its upward left-to-right path across the night sky, towards its zenith in the south. My expectation was that the moment the Moon enters Earth's shadow which marks the beginning of the eclipse would be visually apparent by the darkening of the full moon's outer limb on the right side, and the darkening would progress from right to left from there. When I saw that the darkening actually progresses in the opposite direction, I immediately realized that my understanding of the geometry and kinematics of the Earth-Moon-Sun system must be much shallower than I would have thought.</p><br><br><p>My main question is must lunar eclipses happen this way every time, and if so why?

The apparent survival of these Ultra Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in a rich cluster suggests that they have very high masses. Here we present the stellar kinematics of Dragonfly 44, one of the largest Coma UDGs, using a 33.5 hr integration with DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope. We find a velocity dispersion of 47 km/s, which implies a dynamical mass of M_dyn=0.7x10^10 M_sun <strong>within its deprojected half-light radius</strong> (<em>my emphasis</em>) of r_1/2=4.6 kpc. The mass-to-light ratio is M/L=48 M_sun/L_sun, and the dark matter fraction is 98 percent within the half-light radius. The high mass of Dragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population. From deep Gemini imaging taken in 0.4<dq> seeing we infer that Dragonfly 44 has 94 globular clusters, similar to the counts for other galaxies in this mass range. Our results add to other recent evidence that many UDGs are <dq>failed<dq> galaxies, with the sizes, dark matter content, and globular cluster systems of much more luminous objects. We estimate the total dark halo mass of Dragonfly 44 by comparing the amount of dark matter within r=4.6 kpc to enclosed mass profiles of NFW halos. The enclosed mass suggests a total mass of ~10^12 M_sun, similar to the mass of the Milky Way. The existence of nearly-dark objects with this mass is unexpected, as galaxy formation is thought to be maximally-efficient in this regime.</p><br></blockquote><br>","18078","8"

"<p>67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko has a highly irregular dumbbell shape. But the sample of comet shapes observed is very small, so I wonder if irregular shape is the norm for comets and for small moons.

Moons differ from comets in several ways. AFAIK: Moons in general have a very different gravitational environment, a much more stable distance to the Sun, experience more frequent impacts, another formation history if not captured. Composition and density depends on the formation distance from the Sun, although even ~300 km Hyperion has a similar density as 67/P.</p><br><br><p>Should we expect the small moons in general, and the moons of Pluto especially, to be rounded or dumbbell shaped?

As if it were an animation, the star isn't just a white blob, it looks like the sun, where the blob is moving - as if it were a liquid. No I am not stupid enough to point the scope at the sun... during night time. The stars just move like a liquid in the center, is this an effect of the mirror? I can't see why it would be as the image was fine during daylight. Is this how all stars work? I haven't had a chance to point it at the moon or any other planets so I can't test it on an object that isn't a star.</p><br><br><p>Also, as the scope is a reflector it has the <dq>three lines<dq> on the front, however this interferes with the object I am looking at as i can see the lines on the star.

"<p>Now that LIGO has finally measured gravitational waves using a huge laser interferometer, to me, the question remains, why was it possible? As it is explained in many news articles, gravitational waves are similar to water waves or electromagnetic waves, they just do not exist in a medium like water or space, but space-time itself is the transport medium.

The ruler you use for measurement (the laser beam) gets deformed while the wave travels through the measuring device. Otherwise the <dq>ruler<dq> had to live outside of space-time, but there is no outside. If space-time was a cup filled with pudding, on which we had painted a straight line with 10 marks, pushing into the pudding slightly with our thumb does bend the line, but for us, there remain 10 marks on the line, because to measure the extension, we had to use a ruler, outside of our space-time (pudding) to measure, let's say, 11 marks.

While I do not doubt the validity of this assumption, I have some trouble with how they justify it.</p><br><br><p>They estimate the inverse ionization rate for ground state hydrogen at a typical distance from the star, which is of course the lifetime against ionization from the ground state $\tau_\mathrm{ion}^{1^2S}$.

But there is no slit and probably no bending of light.

I mean that if I use 4mm eyepiece then first of all it becomes very difficult to find the object and secondly it's brightness gets reduced when compared to the brightness that I had got using a 20mm eyepiece ?</p><br><br><p>4) Secondly why do the Barlow lenses reduce the brightness a lot. And why on using  Barlow lenses the field of view get smaller and the object passes twice as quickly as without the Barlow ?</p><br><br><p>5)Now the biggest question. Every time I point my telescope towards a visible planet or a star ( I know it's a star because of the sky map), I see almost the same size if both. How is it possible when stars are visible only as small dots. The stars appear to be bluish and the planets which I have seen (mars and jupiter)appear reddish. That's ok but a star can not be visible as a sphere. Stars appear as dots . Don't they ?</p><br><br><p>6)How can I make the telescope give the best results i.e which eyepiece should I use and whether I should use Barlow lenses or not ?</p><br>","18706","3","18707","1"

Here's the information I was able to get that I needed to calculate the diameter:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>Focal Length of Telescope: 1.2 m</p><br>  <br>  <p>Multiplier for Barlow Lens: 2x</p><br>  <br>  <p>Camera CCD (Sensor) dimensions: 14.8 x 22.2 (mm)</p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>I found the diameter to be 135 pixels in my image.

Substituting my values, I got:</p><br><br><p>\begin{align}<br>\text{Field of View} &amp;= \frac{0.0222}{2.4} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}\\<br>&amp;= 0.53^\circ <br>\end{align}</p><br><br><p>As my entire image is 4271.8 pixels wide, and I know the angular field of view, I used ratios to get the field of view of the 135-pixelled Jupiter to be $\theta = 0.017^\circ$.</p><br><br><p>Then, using basic trigonometry, I was able to calculate the radius of jupiter:</p><br><br><p>$$\tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\text{Radius of Jupiter}}{\text{Distance to Jupiter}}$$</p><br><br><p>The photo was taken on March 22, 2016 - Wolfram Alpha gives 667.6 million as the distance to Jupiter on that day:</p><br><br><p>$$\tan \left(\frac{0.017^\circ}{2}\right) = \frac{\text{Radius of Jupiter}}{667.6 \cdot 10^6}$$</p><br><br><p>$$\therefore \text{Radius of Jupiter} = 97\ 577\ \mathrm{km}$$</p><br><br><p>Googling the radius of Jupiter gives $69\ 911\ \mathrm{km}$ as the result.

"<p>When an object in the space comes close to a massive body (like a black hole or a neutron star), we see from Earth that its speed significantly increases while it is close to the body.

But also, gravity causes time dilation, so an observer near a black hole will experience less time spans between same events than a far-away observer. So, the question is: if we travel on an asteroid and come close to a black hole, will we experience an increase in our speed, or the time dilation will compensate space distortion and we'll feel the same movement speed as before (i. e. no acceleration)?</p><br>","13905","2","13951","1"
