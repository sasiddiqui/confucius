                "answer": "<p>Great question. You are correct that the song is in A and that E is the V chord. That being said, try not to think of the Eb diminished chord as a substitution chord, because it actually isn't one. And second of all, from a theory perspective, I would encourage you to view this chord as a D# diminished chord and not an Eb diminished chord. I am aware that both of the chords have the exact same notes in them, but this particular chord functions as a D# chord and here is why... The overall cadence [or return to the I chord] here is IV V I, or D, E, A. The D# chord is placed between the IV [or pre-dominant] chord and the V [dominant] chord and provides better voice leading into the V chord. It creates a lot of tension that wants to resolve to notes in the V chord. This is why, in Jazz, diminished chords are often used for a short amount of time... they are very unstable and your ear wants to hear them resolve quickly. You will seldom hear a full bar of a diminished chord for that very reason. The tensions and resolutions of this D# diminished chord at hand are as follows... The D#, which is played in the bass, resolves a half step up to the E [which is the root of the V chord, beautiful!].  The A resolves a half step down to the G#. And the C resolves a half step down the the B natural. Notice how there are three movements of only a half step when moving to the V chord.  Because of this phenomenon, there was a time in music when this \"D# chord\" wouldn't have even been called a chord, but just voice leading. Since the chants of olden days, we have since distilled such harmonic movement into things called chords but originally they were simply voice leading that made for smoother transitions between harmonies. That is why in this particular instance the D# chord wouldn't be seen as a substitution, because it isn't substituting for anything... it is transitioning between two block sounds. I hope this helps! \n</p>",

People also tend to play vinyl much louder and systems set up for vinyl tend to have independent (as well as analog) mixing systems in the rack. Hearing is like a bell curve - it is exactly true to say that louder music sounds clearer to the human ear. Listening to a record is also something usually done all the way through and very often bands will list their tracks on an album in an order that compliments each other well which also contributes to the overall experience. Vinyl (ultimately recorded on tape) is also purely an analog system - analog meaning at its most base form of the word \"one thing taking the place of another\" - there is no signal reprocessing or re-interpretation outside of what the user does to the original track which is an \"analog\" - a direct physical representation - of the original sound waves produced when recording as apposed to a digital emulative representation of that sound. This is not to imply that analog music is not mixed - far to the contrary - but the data being manipulated is a physical representation of a vibration at a point in time (ultimately transferred to the vinyl) and not simply a reproduced copy of that vibration by a device which must interpret a digital signal as would be true with digital music.\n\nDrawbacks of vinyl include;\n\nNo exact track selection when desired\n\nRecords are easily scratched or damaged often by the very equipment used to play them\n\nTurntables are extremely sensitive to vibration and movement - jumping on a wooden floor will likely skip one from halfway across the room\n\nNot all records are compatible with all players though players exist which can play almost any size or speed record\n\nVinyl is a plastic which means that any record has a built-in lifetime from the time it is pressed. Poor vinyl lasts less time and even records which still play likely suffer from degradation. It is also very sensitive to damage from sunlight and abrasion by dust.\n\nAnd oh yeah... try playing records in your car or while jogging sometime.</p>",

Only with music you are talking about a much wider variable than 52.  But because music is not as neatly randomized as a deck of cards we have forces of trend.  So stretching that metaphor: its like if for the time being we decided that the ace of spades always stays in the same place but shuffled the rest of the deck.

In our culture we only have 12 pitches and then they repeat themselves. There's only so many combinations you can have before melodies start to be perceived as similar. Pitches can be grouped into 4 chords (major, minor, augmented, dimished, and their variations), and there aren't that many combinations of chords. There are only so many instruments and combinations of instruments. In the last century we had recording technology to advance music and now we have digital effects to explore. I just described thousands of years of musical evolution, but my point is that each new way music evolves becomes less related to the actual pitch content and more about the timbre (sound color). \n\nReturning to the deck of cards metaphor, 10 shuffled decks of cards may have 10 different sequences, but they are all perceived the same by us -- 4 suits of the same card values put in slightly different orders. To counter this in music, we kept adding more suits to the deck, but the fundamental structure of 12 pitches is underlying and completely explored territory at this  point. \n\nI'm not sure that I believe my own argument,  but I gave it a try.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>It's kind of a sinister thing where the music is more focused on defining random, jittery emotions, rather than focusing on a perpetual and consistent beat / time signature (4 or 3s for waltzes, etc). That's the rhythmic \"math\" side. It's like really free form jazz with a rock base (and bass lol). The melodic side of math core can be pretty excruciating to people who enjoy western melody. But it's similar to the mindset of building and progressing in the way classical music did. There would be an initial idea and a final destination and it may not matter what-the-fuck-all happens in between so long as it maintains some concept of the initial idea (by repeating something similar in any way) and incorporating it as a supporting characteristic in the final sections of the piece. However, now, we do it with screaming guitarists from Scandinavia and a double kick pedal. And thrashing vocals that may or may not allow a singer to work in the industry for more than 3 years safely. It's very much an exercise in patience, to learn those songs. There is a place in music for kids who still have to read the lyrics to ever learn them. This is just where that culture has ended up. Common occurrences are odd time signatures, reaching tonal expressions (not always in key), and seemingly random rhythmic gestures inside otherwise normal progressions. A lot of stuff that calls itself math rock may be a reach. But to a non-musician, the range of melody can often be misleading. I guess that's the beauty of music. edit [this qualifies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_CJiwYq1Cg) and dude kills it. random googling to find that</p>",

This could cause the amplitude of the waves (the amount that the gong is vibrating back and forth and how much it's disturbing the ambient air pressure) to be larger than the initial strike.

First, modern production standards in POP rock/alt music place the guitar squarely in the background. Any guitar solos in top 40 music from this time period may likely be classified as flourishes rather than what you and I might consider a solo. Secondly, I'd argue the gross commercialization of the pop music industry has actually filtered out and pushed away many many many great musicians who simply are so determined to play what they want that they have no desire to make cookie-cutter music. As it happens, cookie cutter music is the fastest way to become a proven \"successful musician.\"  As much fun as touring for no money might be, very few polished recordings are ever produced and even fewer get any functional circulation. \n\nNoel Gallagher is still releasing original music with High Flying Birds and it's great. It's got the kind of clean production you want with obviously the same kind of songwriting you prefer. That is the only spot-on suggestion I have.

They're the exact same set of notes on the piano. But, when you're playing music and there's a key change, it's easier to write and make the transition when you you use the same sets of accidentals. For example, if you're in F# major (6 sharps), it's easier to transition to C# Major instead of Db Major. Switching from flats to sharps feels weird and is a little awkward to the performer.\n\nThe other part is more abstract and theory based. There's usually a reason for a key change, in that the new key functions in a way that is related to the old key. So that relationship is better preserved and made obvious maintaining the same usage of sharps or flats. Like in the previous example, going from F# to C# is a perfect 5th and C# is found in the key of F#, but a Db is foreign to the key of F#. \n\nBack to function (and this gets more theoretical) C# supports the F# because it is 5th degree of the scale. The 5th of the scale is really important and is called the \"dominant.\" So when the key changes from F# to C# for a while, that \"dominant\" relationship is better preserved visually by using C#s instead of Dbs.\n\nEdit:  this is all based on our European system of music where the term \"octave\" implies that there are only 7 notes in a scale/key, and the 8th note (the octave), is where they start repeating again. So, to make the music easy to read, you want to use one of each note of the scale in each key. So always use an A, B, C, D etc, only once when you're spelling the scale and you don't mix sharps and flats together in the same scale. \n\nYou could spell the key of Bb as Bb, C, D, D#, F,G,A, Bb. But it'll look weird on the page to constantly be toggling those Ds between natural and flat. Easier to just call all the D#s as Ebs. Maybe the edit better answers your question.</p>",

Classical and jazz compositions use this technique a lot.\n\nSpecifically, we're in A major. You'd expect a B chord to be minor in the key of A Major, but here it's usually diminished which is what you'd expect if the key were in A minor.\n\nThe progression A major / G Major /D Major (with F# in the bass) is pretty standard... if we were in the key of D. The G Major chord just doesn't belong in A major.\n\nAlso, an E chord is usually Major in the key of A, instead it's minor at the chorus, again suggesting that were in the key of D, because in D-major an E chord is expected to be minor and then go to... an A major chord! But we're not in D, trust me, we're definitely in A. \n\nThese brief simulations of other keys are called tonicizations. The borrowing of chord types from other nearby keys is literally called borrowing, or sometimes altering. The A major chord exists in both A major and D Major and that's how the song switches between the two keys, and that's called a pivot chord.\n\nIt's really well done and purposefully sudden, probably because the songwriter decided to make the chords just as weird as those lyrics. Man those lyrics don't make any sense. Nice song, thanks for sharing!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>This is a really good question. Part of it lies in the history of each key. Symphonies by Haydn and Mozart, for example, tended to be written in C, F, G, and D major (and their relative minor keys), because separate horns were needed for each key. I've heard that Eb major evokes the holy trinity because of its 3 flats.\n\nIt also depends on how a key works with particular instruments. A major is particularly bright on violin (as is E major), since it is the middle string of the instrument, one of the most resonant, and is easy to play; all of these also contribute to why so much American fiddle music is in A.\n\nAs for tuning, think of it like trying to make a map of the globe. No matter which kind of map projection you use, you're still going to have some versions with parts of the Atlantic ocean cut out, or a big-ass Greenland. It's the same with tuning - no matter how you tune an instrument, certain intervals will always be a little off. The keys have the same spacing between them on a piano because pianos are tuned in equal temperament, so each semitone is the same distance apart. However, that means that the thirds and sixths are never quite in tune. String instruments are tuned using just temperament, so their fifths are in tune with one another, but the greater the distance between two octaves, the less in tune they will be on open strings. There are tons of these little tuning quagmires, and tons of partial solutions - just like all the different map projections of the globe.\n\nBecause of these tuning obstacles, and the fact that some keys sit better on certain instruments, composers have been inclined, for example, to write sad music in D minor just because it worked, until it became a cultural norm. [Here](http://www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/courses/keys.html) are some descriptions of norms for more keys.</p>",

Then loom through the piece for any other accidentals, making a mental note. Look out for particularly hard sections, and think them through in your head. When you first start, play almost as slow as you can, if that makes sense. A very good way to learn, also, is not to play pieces as such, but play church hymns. They are generally just chord after chord; practising reading like this will teach you to read multiple notes at once.\n\nIf you want easy practice, pick up a 'New Hymns and Worship Songs' Book (I will look for a link) and a graded 1/2 sight reading booklet (abrsm)\n\nI live in Britain though, and that is the preferred here\n\nEdit: http://www.musicroom.com/se/id_no/079425/details.html</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Also a pianist and I began on alto sax as well!  Depending on your ability, finding old church hymnals can be a great place to start.  One of the most important things while sight reading is playing in a consistent tempo where you don't need to slow down or stop.  Doesn't matter how slow you are going, your brain needs to be able to figure out how to prepare for what's next in 'real time' without getting used to pausing/stopping.  The other 'most important' thing, which is an extension of what I just said, is to not stop if you screw up.  Keep reading like a slow and steady conveyer belt.  And since you said it's more difficult to do both hands simultaneously, I think the hymns might work well for you since (depending on the hymn) they tend to fit into very predictable harmonies/chord progressions, without much counterpoint.  After that I'd consider reading something less vertical but still predictable, like some easy czerny or hanon exercises.  Those aren't musically satisfying but should get you used to reading simpler things with both hands.  but always slow and steady tempo.</p>",

One way of getting this kind of effect is to use a suspended chord and then resolve it. For example, if you think of Csus4, the notes are C F G. As F and G are a tone apart, it feels tense. If you follow this with a regular C major triad, C E G, it will feel like a resolution. \nI watched the video but 0.30 is silence so it's hard to know exactly what you're thinking of. I'd suggest looking into counterpoint for more information on the techniques in the video. </p>",

Make note though that also in this example the 9 is not an extension but an inner voice. If you want this sound go to the piano and voice the resolution like this... Play an E in the base with the left hand. In the right hand play an E an octave above the E in the left hand, an F# a whole step above the E, a G a half step above the F#, and then a B a third above the G. Resolve this to a regular E minor triad. Viola! That is the sound you are asking about. Hope this helps!</p>",
