Reserve garlic for another use. Allow oil to cool and add remaining ingredients to oil. Use an immersion blender to disperse dry ingredients. Allow to sit 24 hours before use.

This is called Caldo Gallego, \"Caldo\" meaning broth or soup and Gallego meaning rooster (not because there's rooster in it, though that would be fucking awesome, but because red-headed manly mountain-men in Spain are called Gallego for being the red-headed manly bad-asses that they are for eating this manly stew-soup).\n\nI do this Cuban-style so a peremptory \"piss off\" to traditionalists. \n\nAgain, you start with your onions and your peppers, your preposterous quantity of olive oil, your garlic, and your white wine steam-off. \n\nNow, you need you some traditional (dry, not fresh and crumbled Mexican style) Chorizo sausage. I like cutting it in half length-wise then on a bias, but you can dice or whatever you want. Throw it in. How much? Plenty. \n\nAdd white mountain beans -- this time, about two to two-and-a-half times as much as your base. Canned, and don't drain them. There's manliness in that juice. \n\nAdd an equal amount of chicken stock -- fresh is much preferred, but we'll forgive you if you go boxed.\n\nAnd you add one big-ass bag of greens. My supermarket brand (Publix, in the southern US) sells frozen turnip greens with turnip bits in it. This is perfect. But you can use fresh or frozen greens of your favorite type. \n\nYou will simmer this long and slow. You have your base, your sausage, your beans, and your greens, all simmering in your stock. You are a happy bastard. \n\nI like mine a little thick, but you can adjust your stock and cooking time to find the right balance between porridge and soupy goodness. \n\nNotice how we didn't really season this? It's because you really don't have to. I usually add some salt because I'm half fish and am not happy if I don't taste sea water, but the truth it that between the base, the sausage (which adds a ton of flavor), the stock, and that pot-licker goodness from the greens, one spoonful of this soup/stew will put more hair and/or tits on your chest than fucking a early-model Ford Mustang in the tailpipe.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Spices, spices and more spices: beans are pretty much all fairly bland. Beans vary the most in sweetness and texture, but the differences are pretty small in most widely available beans. One notable difference is in Azuki beans, which are pretty sweet (think sweet potato level of sweetness).\n\nYou can try vegetarian chili, which I love very much.\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 15 Oz Cans of Red Kidney Beans (Approx 1/2 lb dried beans)\n\n2 15 Oz Cans of Red Beans (Approx 1/2 lb dried beans) (These are really just small red kidney beans, but it gives the chili a firmer texture- if you cannot find them then just substitute Red Kidney Beans)\n\nAround 1lb of Fresh Tomatoes\n\n24 Oz Strained Tomatoes \n\n1-3 Tbsp Salt (Add to Taste)\n\n2-4 Tbsp Sugar (Add to Taste)\n\n1/2 of a Small White Onion\n\n2 Cloves of Garlic\n\n1/2 a Can of Dark Beer (I use Guinness)\n\n4 Oz Coffee\n\n2-6 Tbsp Your Favorite Chili Spice (To Taste) (I Use Todd's Bauou Dirt)\n\n0-2 Tbsp Crushed Red Pepper (To Taste) (If you like it hot)\n\nThinly chop the onion and finely chop the fresh garlic. Cook the onion in a pan using grapeseed or vegetable oil until clear, then add the garlic and cook a bit longer until the garlic browns. Allow the pan to cool, drain off the excess oil and set aside.\n\nWash and drain the beans and add them to a stock pot (Around 8 Quarts to avoid splatter) along with the onion, garlic and the strained tomatoes. Heat until boiling and then simmer. (If you are using dry beans instead of canned beans, soak them in water for 5-6 hours and rinse before adding to the pot).\n\nRemove the stem area of the tomatoes and chop them up whole into around 3/4\" chunks and add to the pot.\n\nAllow the pot to simmer for around 30 minutes then add the coffee, beer, Chili Spice and the Crushed Red pepper (if you want more heat). Add the Chili spice and Crushed Red pepper gradually, allowing a few minutes for the spice to \"soak in\" between your additions, and check the taste until you like it.\n\nAllow the recipe to simmer for another hour and a half, until the tomatoes are soft, stirring occasionally. Leave the pot uncovered until the chili reduces to the desired thickness. Check and stir at least every 15 minutes. (Note it is critical that you boil the soaked dry beans for at least 15 minutes to destroy the toxic chemical in kidney beans...you do not need to worry about this with canned beans, as they are pre-cooked).\n\nOnce cooked, slowly add salt and sugar to the pot until it matches your taste. Be extremely careful with the sugar- if you add to much it will ruin the chili...add it a tablespoon at at time until you are satisfied. Also do not add the salt to the chili before it is cooked, as this will increase the cooking time.\n\nEnjoy the chili with saltines (my favorite), cheese, chips fries, or whatever your preferred mode of chili consumption is.</p>",

A batch could be made in the morning. By dinner you just portion off some and make pizza. Don't forget to punch the dough down a few times to help develop flavor and texture. Since you may have trouble finding yeast try a sponge starter. There are tons of recipes on line and even some sites that ship starter culture. \n\nSauce can be no cook. Tomatoes and spice mixed together. This should be refrigerated. If you don't it will ferment in the heat. To save space use tomato paste. The paste not only comes in smaller cans but also allows you to control the thickness by how much water you add. Plus the cans have a really long shelf life. While fresh herbs and garlic would be ideal you would be better off with dried. Remember that dry herbs can be stronger than fresh. If the owner has containers or jars that don't take up too much space you can buy bulk spices. \n\nCheese is a two way street. If you want fresh mozzarella you'd probably have to make it yourself. If you can buy logs of mozzarella, Gouda, or provolone than you can hang to save space. Any shredded cheese needs to be refrigerated. The logs should be kept in a cool place until cut. \n\nDried meats should be bought in small logs that can be hung. Most cured meats can last years hung up in a cool place. \n\nGood luck. </p>",

The key to not simply burning money in the street is Process, Sourcing, Systems, and Scalability.\n\n Learn and deeply understand the process yourself before attempting to train others. The only thing worse than no training is bad training. Bad habits are impossible to get rid of and will slowly poison your business from the inside out.\n\nSourcing: Have simple and reliable sources for all your ingredients and readily available backups for all your equipment. You should be able to make pizza for 6 months after a nuclear war.\n\n\nSystems: Everything has a system in place to outline how it is done. Everything from weighing flour to operating the register to mopping the floor. You must be an expert at these and be able to train a new person at the drop of a hat. Remember what I said about bad habits.\n\n\nScalability: If today is a slow day you should be able to make just one pizza without all your ingredients spoiling, without anything going in the trash, and without burning money on utilities. If tomorrow you become the biggest hit in China and there's half a billion people lined up for pizza you should be able to sell every single one of them a slice.

Like I never thought about how important closing drawers and cooler doors lightly helps the equipment, as well as the things inside (an absentminded lowboy door slamming shut can shake your sauce out of a container and spill around your lowboy over the rest of your mis en place).  And same with ovens, pots/pans, station mis en place, plates.... Basically if you're not supposed to make noise and are, you're increasing the risk of breaking or fucking something up.\n\nAlso, work from one container to another, with a trash container. Like, one bowl for mushrooms, one for trimming and discards, and one to place product in. Keep your cutting board clean except the current focus.\n\nFold your towels, stay clean. A folded towel is cleaner, more effective, takes up less room, etc.  And keep your station as clean and organized as you can. And line sweeps show a chef you don't want to lean when you don't have something to do, as well as you care about the cleanliness of his kitchen.\n\n\nSharpen your knives, and get nice ones. Show pride in what you're doing and what you use to do it. If someone has a dull ass Mercer or Shun that's been beaten to hell, I can assume they won't be caring much for whatever tasks those knives will be put to. NOTE this does not necessarily translate to knives make you better. I have indeed seen good knife work from terrible knives. So that's why I say sharpen your knives before you get a nice new set of Inox or Masamotos. Splurge after you learn to sharpen and maintain knives.\n\nStart reading cookbooks. Good ones, not Jaime Oliver's best 100 Fuck Ups or whatever. Phaidon is a fantastic publisher, with restaurants like Osteria Francescana and NoMa in their collection. But also, like just badass books about ingredients and tastes and butchering and yea. You'll learn to enjoy going through a cookbook and dissecting their creative processes and cooking methods. I suggest getting a copy of The French Laundry to begin with. Or Momofuku. Both are great starter books. The Fat Duck Cookbook is a much more advanced volume but it is oh so sweet. And maybe one day you can get a copy of elBulli or Modernist Cuisine when you've fallen in love with reading.\n\n\nStage around. If you don't know what staging (stah-j / stah -jing) is, it's basically a tryout or short intern at a restaurant traditionally used as an interview, but also as a way to get around some kitchens. It's a great way to spend a day off for workaholics like 90% of our industry. And a lot of restaurants will honor your time in their kitchen with a few dishes to taste their menu. And you get a feel for other kitchens, chefs, teams, cuisines, etc. AND you can network, set up more stages at better restaurants, set up future jobs and relationships within the industry.\n\nLastly, listen to everyone. That guy that's in the weeds every night and looks like a mess? Maybe what he tells you has some weight because he knows how he's messing up. Some of the best coaches were mediocre or even laughable players. A lot of the time everyone has sage wisdoms to share. When I train new cooks I usually try to help them beyond myself, so they start off as high off the ground as possible. If someone is giving you shit or calling you out, it's because they want to push you to be better. Take it in stride and be better, don't get offended. </p>",

The trick will be to learn that as you have taken a step from a volume focused enviroment into a quality one: what components you can prepp/precook and how far. \n\nYou need to taste everything you dish out. \"Well it was ok an hour ago\" mentality wont cut it any more. Be critical of the work you do. Dont just wing it. Would you serv it to your SO on that special night? Be critical of your work and not yourself.\n\nThe recepies, specific handling techniques and exotic raw ingredients the head or sous cheff should tell you how they want it and what ever are the special considerations. Because they will differ from place to the other. If they dont: look for a new job ASAP, be cause they're assholes and you deserve better.\n\nShow some elementary understanding that it is after all a profit making business -> know what the ingridiants are worth and show it in your work.

It's mainly what I do at my restaurant, along with every other station once in a while if I'm not feeling it. It has its challenges for sure, especially with timing dishes properly, but you do eventually get the hang of it. If you're expecting to read a post and get good at it, you're expecting too much. I would say it takes a minimum of three months to get decent at it with a little experience. Minimum. Another three months to feel comfortable, and I would say around a year to have a really good grip on what you are doing. \n\nIt really is one of the most rewarding stations in my opinion, as it transfers over to cooking outside of the kitchen quite well. This is a station that real chefs work. Not just any line cook, but somebody who understands the craft. Anybody can slap steaks on a grill, throw stuff in a fryer, build a 30 second salad in a bowl. But this station? It requires skill. Pacing, timing, tasting, yelling and getting so pissed off you'll storm off line only to come back the next night and do it again. You'll learn when to cook what so things don't burn, when to add spices, how much to add, how long it takes to cook specific things and a whole bunch of other stuff.\n\nAnyways don't get stressed. It's all about learning and growing in this industry. Get rid of the mindset that is holding you back and dive in head first. I've been where you are. Its pretty demanding at first but you will feel more like an actual chef than a short order cook if you work at it. \n\nAnd hey, if you end up not liking it? Just quit and move on. There are endless other restaurants out there for you, which is the great part of being a cook. A good one is always in demand, and that is a promise. \n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>EDIT: Disclaimer since this has gotten to so much attention: I am not a scientist. I am a cook and food writer. All of the information in this post is based of several studies and other articles regarding MSG. I realize my thoughts my seem a bit radical, but they are merely echoing what I have researched. Also, no, I am not payed by MSG manufacturers, I am a long time contributor and moderator here.\n\nMSG is not bad for you at all.(Under normal circumstances, reasonable amounts and based on clinical studies)\n\n\nMSG- Mono Sodium Glutamate. Glutamate being Glutamic Acid, a non-essential amino acid. Non-essential meaning your body produces it naturally. That's right, glutamates are in your body right now! Mono-sodium meaning it is bound to sodium rather than protein or say potassium.\n\nGlutamic Acid is a neurotransmitter. You need it for your brain to work. Without it, you'll die.\n\nNow being non-essential, it is true you do not need to consume it, like you would say tryptophan. However, being an amino acid, which are the building blocks of protein, glutamic acid must exist in a lot of food right? Well yes it does, and plenty of it! Tomatoes, Cheese, Meats, Fish, Algae, Soy, all of those contain good old glutamic acid, aka a form of MSG(EDIT: Yes, I know they are not the same thing, I am only making this point for ease of understanding). You are consuming a form of MSG whenever you eat any of the these foods!\n\nTo make MSG, you basically just must isolate glutamic acid, then add sodium. This was originally done in the early 1900's by the Japanese from seaweed in order to purify the \"umami\" flavor. They would dehydrate seaweed and being high in glutamic acid and sodium, MSG would form crystals on the top. Today, we use more modern and efficient means through bacterial fermentation.\n\nNow that whole \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\"(CRS) thing. First things first, it doesn't exist. In 1968 Robert Ho Man Kwok reported feelings of \"numbness at the back of the neck, gradually radiating to both arms and the back, general weakness and palpitations.\" This occurred after he ate a Chinese-american meal and blamed the culprit MSG. Thus CRS was born.\n\nEver since then, CRS has scared millions of Americans though the medias portrayal of MSG and CRS. Now you will see almost every single Asian restaurant with a \"no MSG\" sign on their establishment or Menu.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, and regardless of what you have heard, there is no(read: none, zip, zilch) proof(read: proof) that MSG causes CRS or any other symptom(EDIT: There are studies that state otherwise, just not conclusive to humans). An exception would be if you consume ridiculous quantities, i.e. several ounces(which would taste unpalatable!). In fact it is far less toxic than salt(5 times less!, 15-18g/kg vs 3g/kg), its cousin in seasoning. Again, there has been several double blind studies proving that not only did CRS not exist, but so called \"MSG sensitivity/allergy(Fun fact: If someone ever says they have an allergy to MSG, you're talking to a ghost because they are died)\" didn't exist.\n\nConclusion/TL;DR: MSG is not even remotely dangerous to humans.(Under normal circumstances, reasonable amounts and based on clinical studies)\n\nEDIT: I am not a scientist, I don't have all the answers. I don't know why you or a loved one has problems with MSG. It is possible that you have some sort of reaction, anything is possible. There are plenty of claims that have linked MSG to some side effects and claims that assert a MSG sensitivity exists. However, from the clinical studies we have done on humans, even those who identify as \"MSG sensitive\", we have never been able to reproduce or prove any ill-effects of MSG. I apologize if I worded or provided misleading information, that was not my intention. I am just a cook and food writer with a somewhat extensive research background in MSG.\n\nEDIT: I realize my statements regarding the safety of MSG are a bit harsh. Nothing is ever for sure, and yes MSG could in theory be harmful. The fact of the matter is, we don't know 100%. But we do know that we have been unable to link MSG to CRS or other ill-effects in humans during clinical studies. There are several tests and unpublished work that has given evidence to support the theory that MSG may be harmful to us, but those are not yet conclusive. Therefore, as of now, I believe it is safe to say that MSG is not harmful to humans under normal circumstances.\n\nLAST EDIT: As always, read for yourself and make the decision for yourself. This is only my opinion and what I believe based on what I have read. You might want to take the cautious route, which is fine. But since most if not all the claims regarding the hazards of MSG are not conclusive enough for me, I am fine with MSG.</p>",

Short answer to your question: buy the little packets of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix along with some mayo and buttermilk and make your own. To my tastes, the bottled dressing tastes almost nothing like the \"real\" ranch dressing you make at home.\n\nFrom Malcolm Gladwell (http://www.gladwell.com/2005/2005_09_05_a_bakeoff.html)\n\nThis was a reflection of what might be called the Hidden Valley Ranch principle, in honor of a story that Samson Hsia often told about his years working on salad dressing when he was at Clorox. The couple who owned Hidden Valley Ranch, near Santa Barbara, had come up with a seasoning blend of salt, pepper, onion, garlic, and parsley flakes that was mixed with equal parts mayonnaise and buttermilk to make what was, by all accounts, an extraordinary dressing. Clorox tried to bottle it, but found that the buttermilk could not coexist, over any period of time, with the mayonnaise. The way to fix the problem, and preserve the texture, was to make the combination more acidic. But when you increased the acidity you ruined the flavor. Clorox's food engineers worked on Hidden Valley Ranch dressing for close to a decade. They tried different kinds of processing and stability control and endless cycles of consumer testing before they gave up and simply came out with a high-acid Hidden Valley Ranch dressing \u2014 which promptly became a runaway best-seller. Why? Because consumers had never tasted real Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, and as a result had no way of knowing that what they were eating was inferior to the original.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As a chef by profession and a chinese american, here are my thoughts. Unless you have a wok and have an ultra awesome heat source worthy of a wok(like a high pressure outdoor propane burner or any other heat source that sounds like a jet engine when turned on), you will want to cook your meats and veggies separate or in very small batches in very large saute pans. The trick to stir fry is the super high heat, and use vegetable, canola, or peanut oil because they have a higher burning temp than olive oil or butter. So put about 1Tbsp oil in a large saute pan on your largest burner on the highest heat and wait til the oil starts to smoke. Throw your thinly sliced or julienned meat into the pan, prepare for hot oil splatter, loud noises, and probably flames. this is when you start stirring it. Stir rapidly and try to toss it in the pan at the same time, it will cook very quickly. No more than a minute. Now take it off the heat for a sec and get the meat onto a plate or some vessel. don't worry if some pieces are under done. Put that pan back on high and add whatever amount of oil you lost to make 1Tbsp, wait for it to smoke again add your veggies and fresh thinly sliced garlic. If you're planning on using thicker cut veggies like broccoli, blanch them first. When your veggies are done add the meat back in along with any juices from the meat. Ok, so here's the part not everyone agrees with me on and I blame it on western cookings preference of pan sauces. Make your sauce ahead of time and add it to your stir fry at this point. It sucks when you add too much slurry and have to add more water/stock to make it the right consistency, thus diluting your flavors. It also sucks If you over season your food or make it too spicy to eat(which i don't believe is ever an issue). I prefer a simple brown sauce made by sauteing garlic and scallions until tender, deglazing with mirin, and adding brown sugar, pork stock, and soy. Reduce that by half, strain into a different pot and add fresh chopped basil, chili pepper flakes, and white pepper then thickening with slurry. So add enough sauce to attain the moisture you want and eat your meal immediately because eventually the salt will pull the moisture out of your veggies leaving you with the wet mush you enjoy eating cold at 2am. I hope this helps! Sorry about the amount of reading.</p>",

Must be washed immediately.\nSome health departments require colour coded boards and bins for chicken. \nAlso to sterilize all surfaces with 2% bleach solution every two hours. \n\nOn the other hand raw chicken in and of itself DOES NOT MAKE YOU SICK.\nChicken does NOT have salmonella automatically in each and every bird.\nSalmonella and ecoli does occur naturally in the soil and air and yes in chicken shit. \nSome chickens therefore MAY have be contaminated, (like one in half a million)\nThe trouble is that during processing, because they are so small, and the food industry is so speedy, a bit of chicken shit from a contaminated bird with disease DOES go ahead and spread this to its neighbors on the assembly line. \nThen they dump every bird in a bleach bath, (fecal soup anyone) and the birds that were perfectly clean, now not so much.\nOverall it is a lottery and we are trained to treat all chicken as contaminated and to cook it to 165 F or else.\nThe public is then blamed for all food poisoning, because, >your fault, you didn't cook it enough!\n\nSo yes it looks gross to see TV cooks messing everything up with dirty hands.\nCan be an issue with allergies; it only takes a tiny amount to cause a reaction with some people. \nAlso esthetically very uncomfortable to watch.\n\nBut when public food handling service is performed in a Sushi restaurant or in fine dining or catering, staff are trained to be extremely conscious of cross-contamination and of not going from meats to vegetables to spices etc. \nAlways use a tongs or a tool instead of hands. \nWash hands and cutting boards frequently. \nClean and flip cutting boards.\nMis-en-Place to avoid hectic motions like described. \nAlso not rubbing you nose, or eating, or double dipping. \nWe even learn to taste sauces etc. by using a ladle to transfer to a personal tasting spoon, not going directly from the pot to mouth.\n\nTaste with the same spoon ten times? Same as spitting in it!\nBut if its your grandmother doing this at home on her own, with no one watching....\nwhere's the harm.  :) \n </p>",

If that's still not working, tie with butchers twine.  \n\nRelated Problem #1-a: This will happen if you cut them up individually raw and then cook.  They are best cooked while still in links.  Prick well with a sausage pricker, then poach in non-quite-simmering water until just barely cooked through.  After chilling, you can now cut into individual links without the explosion problem.  \n\nRelated Problem #1-b: They should be about 90% full.  If you fill them 100%, then they will explode when you try to twist into links.  You want them to be nice and tense after they've been twisted.  You get the feel for it with practice.  Also, remember that pricking them is very very important to avoid exploding.  \n\nProblem #2: For fresh sausage, no need to dry at all.  Are you thinking of cured sausages, because then that's a whole long answer.  \n\nProblem #2-a: ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED!  This alone will solve almost all your issues.  You need to let the air come out of the casing and it also allows the juices released during cooking to come out rather than bursting the casing.  Now, they should be the smallest holes possible, don't just stab away with a knife.  A thin skewer or a sausage pricker will do the trick.  \n\n\nProblem #3: Ice is for very large batches, a kick ass grinder and it helps keep the fat from emulsifying into the meat during grinding.  (unless that's what you want, like a hot dog).  Your grinder can't take ice and your batches would be too small to really make it worth it, since it shouldn't be getting all that hot anyway.  Just keep an eye on temperature control and make sure the fat isn't melting into the meat.  \n\nOne last note, soak the casing at least overnight, if not for days.  Change the water daily.  Not only are the casing super duper salty, but they very tough and not very pliable when you buy them.  The more they soak, the looser they get allowing for more stretch while stuffing.  Stuff slowly at first, avoiding air as much as possible.  You'll get the feel for it and eventually be able to pick up the speed.    </p>",

                "answer": "<p>1) Have you tried [tying it](http://i.imgur.com/N5RkX.jpg)? \n\n2) Depends what kind of sausage you're trying to make. If you're trying to do a dry-cured sausage in a home kitchen, try hanging it in your fridge. (Looping your twine around a hefty bottle on the shelf you're hanging it from is a good trick here.) Also, the holes are a good call, but they're just as much about getting air pockets out from under your casing, which goes a long way toward preventing spoilage.\n\n3) Ice itself isn't really the binder -- it's more of a way to keep any fat you're incorporating into the sausage chilled so it doesn't melt while you're grinding it or stuffing it. Well-incorporated but still distinct chunks of fat result in a better texture than greasy melted fat throughout. Not necessary for all sausages, but it can be a big help for some, especially those with a high added fat content (like supplementary fatback, for example).\n\nAlso, generally, as far as stuffing goes, the only thing I can really recommend is a slow and steady hand. Gives you way more control over how your sausage is fulled, depending on what kind of sausage you're going for -- a loose merguez and a mortadella would require two very different approaches, and going slower would give you a wider margin for getting it right. \n\nAnd, you know, sometimes it's easier if you make it a two-person job (one person to work the stuffer, another to wrangle the sausage itself), but that's okay, who doesn't love a good sausage party?</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Problem #1: The sausage, when twisted into links, doesn't STAY in links.\n\n- You need to alternate the direction you are twisting them.\n\nRelated Problem #1-a: When they cook, the casing shrinks but the meat expands, and with no seal on the end, they just bust right out into a mess.\n\n- Cook your sausages with lower heat, it should take some time to cook a sausage properly, go no higher than medium heat on your stovetop and flip them frequently to insure they cook evenly.\n\nRelated Problem #1-b: How \"filled\" should the sausages be before they are twisted into links? Should I press as much in there as I can, or leave it a little loose?\n\n- You shouldn\u00b4t try to overstuff your sausages but they should generally be pretty well full after stuffing. Air bubbles are the enemies of good sausage, they expand when heated and burst, often letting all those lovely sausage juices run out leaving you with dry, mealy, crap. Be sure to pierce any air bubbles with a needle prior to cooking.\n\nProblem #2: How important is the \"drying\" process? What is a good method? Is there a way to accomplish this in a standard home kitchen? (I also tried to do this myself, but to no avail)\n\n- I'm not sure what you mean exactly by a \"drying process\" exactly but I think you may be referring to hanging them or dry-curing? This is done for particular styles of sausage and is strictly optional. To do it at home first make sure you have enough nitrites in the sausage for it to remain sanitary while it hangs, otherwise you're simply creating a wonderful place for bacteria to grow. Second, most of these cured sausage styles are traditionally hung in caves and the like, so simply find the most cave like portion of your house and hang it there, cool, dark, moderate humidity, a closet or defunct wine cooler can do a good job.\n\nProblem #2-a: Some things I read suggested poking small holes in the casings for the drying process. Necessary, or terrible advice?\n\n- No idea, sorry\n\nProblem #3: I've often heard of chefs using ice as a \"binder\" for sausage, particularly pork sausage, but I have no idea how this is accomplished or what purpose it serves. Is this causing my problems? Should I be doing it anyway? Should it be done for non-pork sausages?\n\n- Ice is used sometimes when you need to make sure your mixture stays absolutely chilled, good for emulsified sausage and the like that run the risk of breaking if you run them through a grinder that is too hot, perhaps this is why they refer to it as a \"binder\". It's also great for cleaning out a grinder after your done with it. As with all sausage though its imperative that everything be absolutely chilled when you're working with it. Throw you're entire grinder assembly into the freezer before you even start, keep the bowl that will catch the ground meat over ice, only pull your meat out of the fridge when you're ready to start stuffing, etc.\n\nMichael Ruhlman has a book out called simply Charcuterie which is an excellent read, something like $20 on iTunes last I checked.</p>",

While you're waiting for it to boil, start making the sauce. You'll need ~250-300g of dried pasta for two, a long flat pasta will work. You can use fresh if you can find it made at a local Italian grocery or at a lot of nice supermarkets sell fresh pasta. You could make 500g for two.\n- So I would start buy heating up a good amount of olive oil (~1/4 cup, you want it to have a decent coating on the bottom of the pan, this is the base of the sauce so you need a fair amount) \n- I'd throw in 1-2 cloves of garlic, peel them but leave them whole, and ~3 anchovies (or more if you like them a lot). Let that cook on low for a little until the anchovy has melted and the garlic is fragrant. \n- Then I'd turn up the heat a little and add the chopped up mushrooms. You can really use any kinda but if you could find them, fresh porcinis would be amazing and very Italian but they can be hard to find. Check your local farmers market. Cook these until soft and cooked. Add salt and pepper as needed.\n- Check your water and when it's boiling, salt it with a healthy handful of salt. You want it to taste like the sea. Don't underestimate this step, it's your only chance to season the pasta itself. \n- Add the pasta and set a timer for 1 min less than what the box says for al dente\n- I'd chop up the zucchini flowers in short wide strips and right before your pasta is done (like 2 min before), add the zucchini flowers to the mushroom and oil. If the mushroom mixture isn't very wet with olive oil, I'd add a bit more.\n- remove the garlic cloves.\n- taste the pasta to see if it's cooked. When it is, take a mug and take out some pasta water and put it aside.\n- drain the pasta and dump it into the mushroom mixture\n- toss over very low flame, add a splash of pasta water if the mixture looks dry. \n- add some grated pecorino Romano, I recommend buying a block and grating it yourself. It's super salty so don't overdo it. \n- add some fresh chopped Italian parsley (flat leaf, not the curly one)\n-turn the heat off and toss all that in the pan\n- plate pasta on plates. Add a sprinkle of pecorino Romano and the fresh mozzarella on top. I recommend some fresh gooey burrata which would become a delicious sauce when cut into and mixed into the pasta. Any high quality mozzarella will do, mozzarella di bufula is always a good choice.\n- you can garnish with another sprinkle of parsley and a few of the raw sliced zucchini flower. \n\nPM me if you have any questions! Hope it goes well. \n\nEdit: added a step reminding you to take the garlic cloves out. </p>",

But for good, consistent moisture absorption and more even cooking times, one might slice a potato into a [tourne] (http://thetopkitchen.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/img_0289_1.jpg), which ideally has set dimensions (down to the cm), and seven even sides all the way around.\n\n-----\n\nWhen you do something like this, several things happen to drive up the price of the food you're preparing: \n\n* **Time to prep** - It takes a significantly longer time to prepare a tourne than to slice/dice a potato.\n* **Amount of waste generated** - one tourne is generated from an entire potato. The rest of the potato is waste. Compare this to a simple dice, which might use nearly the entire potato.\n* **Selection of produce** - skinny, misshapen or small pieces may not be able to be sliced into a tourne, so the amount of raw food that can even potentially make it to the table is a lot smaller.\n\n----\n\nThis is just for vegetables -- butchering meat, fish, etc. can often be the same way. Preparation of a proper stock often requires portions of whole meat and vegetables to be cooked and thrown away -- something like a veal stock has a much higher cost of ingredients than you might expect. \n\n-----\n\nLastly, consider the different elements of a dish, and the preparation that might go into those. For example, [this entree from the French Laundry] (http://www.foodnut.com/i/The-French-Laundry-Yountville/The-French-Laundry-Yountville-pekin-duck.jpg) is described as \"Liberty Farm Pekin Duck Breast \u2013 Petite Onions, Baby Leek pur\u00e9e, and Stewed Oregon Huckleberries\"\n\nHere they need to cook the duck to medium rare; and then separately prepare the onions, puree the baby leeks, and then stew the huckleberries. In a home kitchen, you might think of that as 4 separate recipes -- just for one entree! And when you consider the price of the ingredients (local, then the duck, only the tenderest part of the breast is being used)... that drives up the price even more. \n\nSource: I like reading about food a lot. </p>",

The other factors you're describing (multiple people getting sick around the same time) are consistent with a foodborne illness outbreak. \n\nHowever, the symptoms are also consistent with other foodborne pathogens. I hope that the doctor who issued the Trichinosis diagnosis actually saw the parasite under a microscope or contracted a lab to do it. If he heard the symptoms and \"pig roast\" and just said \"ah-ha! Trichinosis!\" then he may simply be mistaken. The Trichinella parasite is not nearly as ubiquitous in domestic swine herds as it once was. I often tell people that it's OK to eat medium rare pork chops in restaurants these days. \n\nSo, there are a couple root causes here. First, it's possible your thermometer was just wrong, not calibrated correctly, etc. I'm a little skeptical of that cause, generally, because even if it's not temping right the cook should know what rare/raw pork looks and tastes like and the meat should have passed chef's quality checks before being served to guests. Did it? If the thermometer said the meat was cooked and it was hot to the touch on the inside AND it looked fully cooked then I might doubt the Trichinosis diagnosis. \n\nThe fact that the rest of the dishes were pot luck is somewhat of a red flag. When home cooks attempt to cook for large crowds and the food is served outside the risks can pile up. For example, I am aware of an outbreak at a church potluck years ago that resulted from the food being served buffet style too close to a dirt/gravel road. Dust from the road got in the food and many people became ill because that is some serious filth, even in tiny concentrations. I'm not saying that was *your* cause but consider that you might be looking at multiple vectors here. \n\nAs for how to proceed...from what you have recounted I should tell you that you could be sued. In order to collect damages from you your guests will have to prove that they became ill from the pig roast and that you, as the host, assumed liability for providing them with food that was not injurious to heath. It's really much tougher to win this type of case against an individual as opposed to a restaurant or caterer. An apology could look really bad for you if you get sued. I'd avoid it. \n\nThe man who has a trichinosis diagnosis in-hand is the one who stands the best chance of making a case against you. If that's a lab-validated diagnosis I advise you to delete this post from Reddit and speak to a lawyer. \n\n </p>",

Green onions are a different beast entirely, IMO.  \n\nFor flavor -- sugar content, acidity, and flavor.\n\nFor texture -- layer thickness, water content, and fiber content\n\n\"Sweet\" onions like Vidalia, Walla Walla, Maui, Texas 1015, etc are great for applications where the onion will be either raw or lightly cooked (such as being charred on the grill).  While not actually sweeter (i.e., they don't have a higher sugar content) than other onions, they taste sweeter because they are less acidic and will release less pungent compounds when cut/chewed.\n\nWhite onions have a thinner layers, more sugar, are more acidic, and give off more pungent compounds when cut/chewed.  These are great for cooking with.  They are also great for subs, etc, when sliced very thin.  They also keep longer than other types.\n\nYellow onions fall between whites and sweets.  They are kind of the all-purpose onion, and most people prefer to use yellow onions only for caramelizing.  This is the onion I ALWAYS have on hand since it is versatile.\n\nRed onions are beautiful when raw, ugly (grey) when cooked, and are good for raw applications where they are either thinly sliced, put in a sweet brine (will turn pink), or rinsed with water once cut to make them less pungent.\n\nThen you've got shallots, cipollini, green onions, leeks, chives, and other alliums to round everything out.</p>",

There are a few cases in the country a year and they are exclusively from wild animals (boar and bear mostly) as the way the animals get it is eating trash which is no longer done in commercial production.

That recipe also gives a really simple primer that basically says that if you are good about sanitation and sourcing your meat, you should be good to eat the meat raw. However, there were periods in history, especially in the US, where some meat would not be safe to eat raw due to the presence of certain pathogens in the supply chain, [trichinosis in pork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis#United_States), and salmonella in chicken. Because of the perceived fear (no idea how prevalent these issues actually were), generations grew up eating pork and chicken only at a certain doneness, and that became the norm and therefore, \"the right way and only way\". Today, especially with the rise of consumer grade immersion circulators, you can eat any meat at any doneness with minimal reservations. </p>",

Cooking pork to rare is not uncommon among sous vide enthusiasts, and [some people are pretty into it](http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/05/case-for-raw-rare-pink-pork-food-safety.html).  You can also eat chicken raw as chicken sashimi.  This is most commonly found in Japan, but there are places in the US that serve it, too.\n\nIn general it's just a question of how risky you're willing to be, and this depends on how likely the meat is to make you sick and how bad the sickness is.  Pork has historically been a vector for trichinosis and salmonella, and that Serious Eats article I linked to discusses the likelihood of infection from each.  Chicken is also pretty likely to have salmonella, which is no fun.  Even the sous vide people I know tend to cook chicken until it's white all the way through.\n\nMinimum cooking guidelines in the US usually come from the USDA or the FDA.  The former are the ones aimed at home cooks, and assume the worst-case scenario: a cook who doesn't really know what they're doing and standard bacteria-doused commercial meat.  The FDA ones are aimed at restaurants, and assume higher skill and more careful sourcing, so they tend to be less strict.</p>",

China is a very big country with many different types of cuisines.\nI think most people in the west are familiar with Cantonese American cooking, which is where \"lemon chicken\" and \"deep fried everything\" supposedly comes from. But the majority of Cantonese cuisine is neither very sweet nor deep fried. They actually prefer less grease, with blanching, steaming and stir frying with garlic being the norm. Flavours tend to be much more subtle than in let's say Sichuan cooking which uses a lot more spice and peppers.\nA lot of people complain that Chinese food is very fried, salty, sweet or unhealthy. But nothing can be further from the truth about Cantonese cuisine, which tends to have more vegetables, steamed seafood and rice. The deep fried super sweet flavours were what Americans liked. It was made by Americans for Americans (still tasty though).\nAn example is if you get dim sum (yum cha) in America, there's a lot more fried food. But if you go to Hong Kong, it's mostly steamed. I also find that the more North in China you go, the less rice based the dishes become (possibly because in the past, rice could not survive at the colder climates) and you find that there are more noodles, buns, preserved vegetables and alcohol marinades. Chinese cuisine is honestly very broad, so to answer your question: what you consider Chinese food only touches on 0.0000000000001% of Chinese cuisine, and that there really isn't one type of Chinese cuisine, there's too many to count.</p>",

Your best bet honestly is to go with a Chinese friend and have them order. I don't recommend going by yourself and asking in English since that will usually result in something unauthentic or at least terribly off (heaping on extra salt and extra sugar is a common way to 'americanize' any dish).\n\nIf you don't have any friends to go with and you're into spicy things, go to a Sichuanese restaurant and ask for these (any proper Sichuanese restaurant should have these -- walk out if they don't): Fu Qi Fei Pian, Dan Dan Mian, Shui Zhu Yu, and for something light get a plate of Kou Rou and a bowl of Tang Yuan for giggles. For a side of vegetables ask for Dou Miao or Kongxing Cai stir fried with garlic. I would also recommend asking for Hui Guo Rou and Mapo Tofu but those dishes are so commonly butchered by takeout places that I'd avoid it. If you like these common dishes there are some more adventurous things for you to try.\n\nFinally since I'm from Sichuan I always like to share [this article](http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2005/08/frenchlaundry) which is the best I've ever read in English about the divide between Sichuanese and western cuisine.

Most of the secret is old rice (short grain rice - I strongly doubt his restaurant would have made jasmine rice specifically for fried rice), obscene amounts of butter, and soy sauce.  I also prefer mixing the raw egg directly into the rice (but before adding veggies).  I strongly doubt that the restaurant used a premade sauce of mirin, sugar, and soy sauce - that would require too much prep work for my dad's restaurant, haha.  \n\nHere are my steps: \n\n1. Cook rice (short grain for me, but I'm not certain that the specific type matters) & leave it overnight in the fridge.\n2. The next day, shake up the rice so that the grains are separated and not in one large clump.  \n3. Heat oil/butter, cook onions/whatever veggies you want.  Set aside on a plate.  Saute the garlic last, because garlic burns super quick.  \n4. Cook meats (pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, whatever you want) in the same pan.  Let the frond build!  Seat aside on the plate with the veggies.\n5. Add shitloads of butter to the same pan on relatively high heat.  Don't clean it in between unless something started to really burn.  Add in the rice and mix.  Hibachi grilltops use fairly high heat.  Move the rice around quickly.  This is not the time to wander off and browse reddit.  Add soy sauce.  I also like to add garlic powder.   \n6. Whisk an egg in a separate bowl (or have it already mixed) and add it to the rice.  I like to take the pan off of the heat when I do this and let the egg coat the rice grains.  You should have added enough butter in the prior step so that the grains are still fairly separated at this point.  \n7. Add white pepper, a little bit of sesame oil (a little goes a long way), garlic powder to taste, and add the veggies in.  \n8. Mix and eat!\n\n\nTo me, the key required ingredients are: butter, soy sauce, white pepper (there's something about it that makes it a unique flavor that can't be replicated by anything else), and sesame oil.  Taste the rice between the steps to see if you need more soy sauce, salt, white pepper, etc.  Don't wait until the end to taste it for the first time.  \n\nAlso, are you using a non-stick pan?  Non-stick is great for omelettes when it prevents the egg from sticking, but it makes it harder for flavor to really stick and build for certain things like pan sauces.  Same principle for woks - the flavors build as woks are used more and more.</p>",

They do have a shelf life, and if your leaves have a very faint or missing aroma, they're not very useful. \n\n\nAnd if you ever need to buy new bay leaves, try to find fresh. Hang them when you get home and use as needed. They dry wonderfully, which is another reason they're popular. Unlike soft herbs like thyme, bay leaves don't lose much of their inherit qualities from drying. They're just something you always have on hand to add some heady taste to food\n\nAs far as aroma, they add an incredibly subtle scent to your food. They're earthy...woodsy flavors that are hard to replicate with other ingredients. If you actually taste bay leave in a dish, you would pick up an earthy bitterness and you've probably added too much.\n\n\nIf you really want to experiment, try doing some AB testing. \n\n\nAt a restaurant I used to work at we would prepare chicken livers by sauteing them on top of a bay leave. Dredge the liver in salt + flour, place bay leaf in butter & saute. Place liver on top of bay leaf. When you taste something like this you'll be able to discern what a bay leaf tastes like. Try cooking a liver like this, and one without the leaf. \n\n\n</p>",

That way once you get half through the popsicle there is another flavorful section to attack. Here is a demo...\n\n| [ () ] | this is not a vagina, it's a popsicle mould. The parentheses indicate an inner mould you can fill independently from the outer mould, the brackets. Fill the parentheses, freeze, fill brackets, freeze again. \n\n2) Do what the Italians do with the limoncello sorbet, get a fork and every 15 minutes or so fluff the mixture. This way popsicle flavor is evenly distributed throughout the mixture\n\n3) Put your popsicle mixture in an ice cream mixer/freezer before putting it in the mould. This way you get kind of a \"soft serve\" popsicle mix and then just shove it in the mould then into a deep freezer for final freezing\n\nEdit: Just thought of another way. Adding some cream to your mixture in the former of plain/greek yogurt will give you a nice silky texture while disallowing the separation of water from the flavorful juice </p>",

I'd start with the brine-- 1 -2 cups of kosher salt to a gallon of water. Use kosher to keep the iodine out. I'd add some fruit juice -- orange apple cranberry-- something like that. Not necessary but it tastes good. maybe cloves or ginger too.\n\n2- rub after you brine and pat dry. Use a yellow mustard to make it stick. The spices you mention above are good but don't neglect paprika-- critical in my book.\n\n3- I generally smoke rather than cook in the oven. In a smoker, you go for about 225-250 for 1-1.5 hours per pound. Keep going until its done-- use a thermometer and wait for it to start to break down so you can pull it apart with a fork. \n\n4- sauce is a matter of personal taste. I've never seen it with sirrachi but it sounds good. Start with ketchup, brown sugar and some basic spices and Just keep mixing until you're happy. I'd suggest you don't add it till after you've pulled it. Since you're not smoking you might want to add liquid smoke. I dont really like it but many do. You could also have a few options - 1 spicy, 1 sweet , 1 mustard based? \n\nSorry I don't have a more specific recipies but I'm in a bus at the moment. Have fun.

There's actually a thing called an aroma wheel if you look it up. You don't want any one smell to completely dominate everything, everything needs to be in equilibrium.\n\nNow, aroma compounds can be created and destroyed by cooking. Take, for example, the taste of cooked meat and garlic/onions. They react and produce that new aroma. You also can mess up some aromas if you boil them off, citrus terpenes for example. You also can destroy aroma with heat, moreso then creation really. Like with onions, heat gets rid of the sulfur dioxide gas that burns your eyes and mouth.\n\nBasically just try to not ruin good ingredients.</p>",

France was quite influential in the late 1700s/early 1800s, when French cuisine got more refined and more importantly codified on paper by people like Antonin Car\u00eame and Brillat Savarin. In the late 1800s, when the royal families across Europe started to lose power the chefs who worked for them switched to work in restaurants and hotels. These chefs continued to maintain the level of excellence once required by the royal families. The excellence is not so much about the taste but the level of detail when preparing and serving the food: table cloth, napkins, cutlery arrangement, food presentation. France also happens to have a temperate climate ideal to grow many fruits and vegetables and is centrally located in Europe so it could borrow ideas and techniques from neighboring cuisines.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>**EDIT: Jesus, sorry for wall of text. You can just read the TL;DR if you like, or read through my long explanation, and I'll punctuate it with cheese jokes.**\n\nRight, so, to start off, cheese has a different process for making it each time. The first division is pasteurised/unpasteurised. This is whether or not you 'cook' the milk at 62 degrees centigrade first to rid it of any bacteria such as listeria (though evidence that milk has listeria in it in the first place is very far and few between). This changes the consistency of the cheese on a small scale. An uncooked cheese will be a lot 'smoother' and curdy. You get much more of a creamy taste with unpasteurised.\n\nNext, you put the renet into the milk to make it solidify. You could put in a lot, or you could put in a little. The more you put in, the more the curds (cream, milk solids) separate from whey (liquids, sugars). The renet acts to break down simple proteins to separate the milk. As it solidifies, the whey is drained off for use in growing corn/wheat and so on. The more fat inside the cheese, the softer it'll be. Alpine cheese and gouda (emental, old Amsterdam etc usually has less fat than softer cheeses).\n\n**Which cheese do you use to get a bear out of a tree?**\n\nYou can then add the blue spores if you want your cheese to be blue. They do this for some cheddars, too, even though the cheddars aren't meant to be blue. More on that later. Salt is also added. This is where a lot of flavour comes in.\n\n**Camembert (Come-on-bear!)!**\n\nThen the curds are cut up either large or small. Larger curds sometimes mean that the cheese is less dense. Some cheeses use 1cm^2 curds and press them together using a piston or screw. This is called 'cheddaring', and it's where cheddar cheese comes from. When the curds are cut, they are cut with a comb-like rake. At this stage, they are wobbly like jelly cubes.\n\nThen they're put into the molds with holes in it. At this point, the cheese tastes like solid milk, or curds. Maybe a bit like cream, but not as rich.\n\n**Did you hear about the explosion at the French cheese factory?**\n\nThen the whey is drained off over a period of days (or pressed out, if it's cheddar). Softer cheeses are often just left to their own accord, so that the gaps between the curds remain in the cheese. If you've added blue spores, they will start to grow inside these air gaps, where they are exposed to oxygen, converting the complexed sugars in the cheese into basic sugars you can taste. If your cheese is compressed to get rid of these gaps, the blue won't grow (unless you get a crack in the cheese as it matures, as you often will with cheddar).\n\n**All that was left was de brie!**\n\nThe outside of the cheeses are smoothed to stop anything getting in that shouldn't be in, and the cheese is given a covering skin - white mold (Roquefort), wax (Wensleydale), yeast (Stilton), a wash (Stinking Bishop) or cloth (Westcombe cheddar).\n\nThen the cheese is put away for maturing. As a cheese matures, the remaining whey in the cheese evaporates - so much so that the average cheese loses 10% of its weight in evaporation every *year*. As it ages, cheese tends to get dryer and more solid for this reason, and also sweeter as the bacteria work on it. If you want a soft cheese, it'll take less time to mature. Some cheeses, like the Indian paneer are ready straight from the cloth - with a drainage time of 15-25 minutes.\n\n**I went on a cheese diet the other day to cheddar few pounds.**\n\nAs the cheese matures, the bacteria inside the cheese (as well as any that were in the milk) get to work on anaerobic respiration, turning the complicated sugars and tastes locked away in the cheese into palatable tastes we can sense. There are also other aspects - cave moulds, cheese mites and 'sweating' - where the skin is encouraged to 'sweat', leaking the whey from inside onto the outside of the skin where it stays and encourages flavour-making bacteria. Don't worry, though - these bacteria aren't harmful - and in fact act to protect the cheese from harmful bacteria that might want to grow by taking their food source.\n\nThe cheese is turned all through maturing to give it an even amount of gravity, otherwise you find it 'sinks' to be bottom heavy. This is why cheeses are often coin-shaped (with two faces). Parmesan is one of the heaviest cheeses - weighing up to half a ton and a thousand litres of milk. These are turned by - no shit here - a cheese turning robot.\n\n**Did you hear about the bird made of cheese?**\n\nThere are also other cheeses, like Adrahan and Stinking bishop, which have their skins 'washed' with brine or alcohol to make it extra sticky just before maturing. This goes into the cheese from the outside, flavouring it on the way through.\n\n**It was a curd of prey!**\n\nSource: I'm a cheese monger. Feel free to give me any questions.\n\n**TL;DR Separating the curds and whey and putting the curds back together give it the texture. Salt, skin washes, bacteria and moulds give it flavour. Age changes that flavour.**</p>",

The more important part is getting the right blend of fat to lean meat. If you want a Five Guys (or name your burger joint of choice) style burger, odds are you need a blend with more fat. For beef that I'm going to grind, I don't think the premium cuts is worth the money.\n\nNow, for Kobe.. there was recently a thread on this. Kobe beef is a very special thing. It's meat from a wagyu cow raised in Kobe, Japan that has been raised through very particular methods to produce extreme marbling of fat. \"Kobe beef\" is a protected term inside of Japan only, and it's a term that's been totally perverted everywhere else.\n\nIf your beef didn't cost at least $100/pound and didn't come with boatloads of paperwork detailing the cow's life including name, birth date, official grading, plus names and grades of its *parents*, what you have is not kobe beef. It's almost never exported from Japan, either, it's hard to get. The stuff you get stateside that's \"kobe\" or \"kobe style\" is most often just beef from a wagyu cow, which is the same breed used in kobe. The name isn't protected, so it's just a marketing ploy. </p>",

[Underbelly](www.underbellyhouston.com) is a great place to do this in Houston. \n\nAddressing the idea that \"it's just what the kitchen wants to move\" is not really true. Think about this, you're asking the kitchen to impress you. The *ONLY* way a restaurant stays in business is repeat customers. If someone comes in with a \"show me what you got\" attitude, it would be foolish to send out a bunch of almost spoiled fish and vegetables. Good kitchens aren't full of waste anyway. \n\nIf you're wondering how to ask without seeming like an asshole, I think what's key is making sure you're at the right restaurant; namely one with a chef and not cooks, if that makes sense. \n\n**MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT COMPLAIN** If you order this way you are probably going to be served some things outside of your comfort zone. It is very much ok to give your server a budget you want to stay under. Our budget at underbelly last weekend was $400 for the four of us. Given that budget, our server hooked us up and kept it under the budget because the kitchen was really excited to throw some new and unusual things at us. Not all were amazing. Some not worth the $35-$40 we spent on the plate. But the overall dinner was a hall of famer. You are not an asshole for wanting this, and good restaurants and good servers will savor the opportunity.

                "answer": "<p>Some of my favorites I've tried are:\n\n**Mint/chili pepper**\nThese two food items create an unbelievable balance between sweet herb and spicy flavors. This is basically the same concept as the popular cilantro and chilies, just not as overpowering on the palate. I decided to steep these two in water to make tea and what I tasted was basically a breezy spring morning in hell.\n\n**Foie gras/blueberries** \nI was able to try this at my old job as a restaurant's special about a month ago. House made Foie gras tortellini with a blueberry and brandy compote and fresh shaved porcini mushrooms as garnish. The sweet blueberry compote effectively cut the rich, fattiness of the duck liver perfectly while the porcini mushroom shavings added a nice subtle earthiness to finish each bite and keep me wanting more.\n\n**Strawberry/ balsamic vinegar/ black pepper** \nI have heard a lot of talk about this specific combination in the past year, so my friend and I decided to experiment and see what all the hype was about. We incorporated these 3 ingredients into a timbale, which is basically like a smooth, creamy, gelatin based dessert, that is baked in a mold. Anyway, I thought there was a good chance these flavors might be too assertive to be a dessert, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The fresh cracked pepper and balsamic went basically unnoticed, except for the fact that it seemed to make the strawberries have a much stronger strawberry flavor than any unseasoned strawberry I've ever had. Next time I would love try and make a jam with this combo.\n\n**Watercress/pineapple** \nFor me, this food combination really followed the same rule as the black pepper/strawberry flavor combo. Watercress has a fresh, peppery essence that is pretty comparable to arugula. These two ingredients, with the addition of a little mint and lemon made for an insanely flavorful and healthy smoothie. I would imagine this would make a killer garnish-type salad on top of some grilled salmon.\n\n**Mushroom/apricot** \nThe foie gras tortellini dish really inspired me to expand on mixing different fruits and mushrooms because of how interestingly those flavors contrasted. I had some monstrous chicken legs with the skin on, so I seared them in a pan real quick and finished them in the oven. I took the pan drippings from the chicken and saut\u00e9ed some shiitake mushrooms in it. I deglazed the pan with a little white wine and apricot juice and let that shit simmer into a flavorful and balanced sauce that was both sweet and savory. I definitely want to try this on some red meat in the future.\n\n**Fruit/chili powder** \nThe most literal \"sweet & spicy\" flavor profile I could think of. I just dusted some diced honeydew, pineapple, orange segments, and mango with the chili powder, and tossed it with a little salt and fresh squeezed lime. This turned out to be quite an explosive Mexican style fruit salad with an insane amount of flavor.\n\n**Ham/butter** For some reason, ever since I was little I enjoyed baked ham best when it was dripping in melted butter. I think at the time I actually considered butter my favorite food. Regardless of my now educated palate, I still eat this pretty regularly. It's very similar to the flavors melted butter adds to fresh crab meat, in that it provides a rich fattiness, and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.\n\n**Blue cheese/honey** (not really weird just delicious)  \nWine and cheese pairing is something I am very passionate about. It is no secret that almost any combination of cheese, fruit, and nuts is like a fucking flavor symphony on your tongue. Taking classes in both cheese and wine tasting, I have had the pleasure of pairing so many different things with them both. Of over 50 different cheeses we tried in class, hands down the best cheese I've ever tasted was a 3-6 month aged Bayley Hazen Blue cheese. It's not the strongest blue I've ever had, but it will still clear your sinuses for sure. This blue cheese is dense, a bit nutty, and has a strong, spicy acidity. With the edition of honey, this acid is immediately cut and you can literally taste the only farm/creamery where these cows are raised to produce this incredible cheese.\n\nOn a side note, if anyone else here is really into wine pairing, you should check out [this](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timhanni.com%2Fcomponenets_of_flavor.doc&ei=8MnfU5CcAoORyATU9YC4DQ&usg=AFQjCNFPyJMQ_NW851WVMkvpn5xXrVh28w&sig2=Ps9FBHUwE7R12MGMUjsQCQ&bvm=bv.72197243,d.aWw) paper written by Tim Hanni. It's basically his sensory evaluation that states sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, umami, and astringency in food can either heighten or hinder these same profiles in wine. We tested his theory in class by tasting things like salt, sugar, vinegar, gorgonzola, and green apple right before tasting the wine. Basically everything I knew about food was thrown out the window that day, and the results were mind blowing.\n\nEdit: formatting\n</p>",

Most recipes calls for about 5 spices in the spice satchet, my family recipe has 12 (have to go find them in the Chinese medicine shops). Knuckle bones, leg bones, oxtail. Cook the broth for 6 hrs, freeze overnight then melt slowly over a sieve for crystal clear result. Reduce to half.\n\nThe result is superior to the restaurant version without using a lot of MSG and pho dry mix. Not because MSG is bad, but because it's not necessary. Fat is the key here. Keep at least half of the fat instead of skimming it all.\n\n**EDIT**: My spice blend is posted below. For recipe/techniques, check out Andrea Nguyen's [version](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Pho-Bac) and her article on [techniques](http://vietworldkitchen.typepad.com/blog/2007/12/pho-secrets-and.html). There's also another [recipe](http://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipe/11006/Beef_noodle_soup_with_rice_noodles_(pho_bo) by Luke Nguyen. Those are the most accurate versions so far in print and on the web, and very close to my family's. As far as Vietnamese cookbook authors go, I'd say Andrea Nguyen, Luke Nguyen, and Corrine Trang are the closest to authentic. Charles Phan's book is very good, but not as authentic.\n\nNormally, all you need to do is strain the broth through a sieve with coffee filter (works better than cheese cloth), but I went a bit further and use Heston Blumenthal's method of clarifying stock by freezing and let it defrost over cheesecloth. This will give you a super clear stock.\n\nSince spices yield essential oils through the cooking process, which are lighter than water, they'll float to the top and unfortunately will get skimmed away together with the fat, I suggest putting the spices in at the second step when you reduce the stock. Don't skim away all the fat, keep at least half -- it's packed with flavor, and it's what makes your pho taste as good, if not better than restaurant version.\n\nFor the bowl, you want sliced onion, sliced green onion and cilantro. For meat, the Southern version has thinly sliced raw beek, fatty brisket, flank, tendons, tripes, and also beef meatballs; the Northern ~~poor~~ purist version has only sliced raw beef.\n\nFor garnish, you'll need Thai basil, sawtooth herb, bean sprout, lime, chili pepper.\n\nHow's that for being complicated?\n\n</p>",

They're full of it.\n\n*That said*, truffle oil can be tasty, a little bit goes a long way, and a lot of people commit culinary travesties by overusing it. Cut 50/50 with butter, it's great on popcorn with some fresh cracked black pepper and salt. It's also great used in a vinaigrette (use 2:1 ev olive oil to truffle oil) with a little shallot over arugula. Another good use is for a very tiny amount used as a finisher on pasta or risotto.\n\nTruffle oil also varies quite a lot in quality, despite being a mass manufactured synthetic product. Some taste pretty convincingly like truffle, some really don't.\n\nYou mentioned it being musty in another post.. Without tasting I can't say, but it may also be rancid. I once had a friend tell me they bought truffle oil after trying the popcorn at my place, but hated it.

If you do find a brand you like you can stick with it but I typically just get whole tomatoes and pur\u00e9e them with a hand blender.\n\nDiced tomatoes are the worst choice. In order to get them to keep their shape they're typically made from slightly underripe tomatoes and are treated with calcium chloride (a firming agent). They end up with less tomato flavor and an artificially firm texture.\n\nFor whole tomatoes make sure to get a good brand. I like Cento, Muir Glen, or Bianco di Napoli. Avoid Hunt's and Tuttorosso. Certified DOP San Marzano tomatoes are also a good bet as their production is tightly controlled by the Italian government. \n\nTomato paste is a different beast entirely and great for adding deep flavor and thickening up stews and sauces, but it won't have the same bright, fresh tomato flavor you get from whole peeled tomatoes.

Crushed & puree just simply do not have the flavor punch that I am typically looking for in a canned tomato product.\n\nPaste is great for heavy tomato based sauces like for chili, stew, etc.  It also browns nicely which is why you will often toss bones in paste before roasting for a deep rich color in your stocks, or pince the paste before deglazing in a sauce or stew.\n\nIf you are finding the flavor of the paste too intense, just reduce the amount.  A whole can of tomato paste is a LOT of tomato paste, even the little 3-4 oz. cans.  I use one little can for a very large batch of chili, roughly 8-12 qts.</p>",

If so, it wouldn't have the baked/glazed look that the chicken in the picture has. It might have a lot of onions (maybe a whole one, grated, then sliced onion added later), ginger, turmeric, saffron (optional), salt, pepper, chicken broth, oil, and chopped cilantro and flat leaf parsley. \n\nIf it was actually cooked in a tagine, it would likely have been served in a tagine-- was it in a sort of rounded shallow pot? Did it come out with a conical lid that was removed prior to serving? If so, it was probably a tagine. \n\nA lot of restaurants outside Morocco will call dishes \"tagine\" even if they are cooked in a different vessel (since it's not very time/space efficient to do large numbers of tagines at a restaurant). It could be pressure-cooked, or if it looks like your picture, probably baked. \n\nWhen I was in Morocco, I usually had this dish prepared in a pressure cooker (probably 80% of the time), and 20% was in a tagine. I don't know how it could be adapted to be cooked in a dutch oven or baked in a different vessel, but I am sure it's possible with a few small modifications. \n\nAlso-- do not underestimate the power of preserved lemons! The flavor and texture is quite different than regular lemons, and it is usually preserved lemon that is used for this recipe. They are worth the trip to an Arab market. :) \n\nIt might have also been made with smen (a preserved/fermented butter), which lends an incredible flavor that is hard to duplicate elsewhere. \n\nThey are generally marinated/brined (what is the difference?) with salt, pepper, turmeric, a touch of lemon juice, and olive oil... maybe also with some fresh chopped cilantro and flat-leaf parsley. \n\nAlso-- my two go-to English language Moroccan recipe sources are moroccanfood.about.com and anything by Paula Wolfert. \n\n[Here's](http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/maindishes/r/Roasted_Chicken.htm) one to maybe try in the oven that doesn't require a tagine. [Here's](http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/maindishes/r/chick_lem_olive.htm)  a stove-top version.  [This](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chicken-with-lemons-and-olives-emshmel-231572) is Paula Wolfert's version-- it is a bit more similar to the person who suggested ras-el-hanout and uses a bit different spice mixture.  And if you do have a tagine, [this](http://cookingwithalia.com/tajine-of-chicken-with-preserved-lemons/) recipe is adapted to that particular vessel. :) \n\nSource: Married to a Moroccan, lived in Morocco for 5 years. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Judging by the stiffness and white color, it looks like what's called decorator's buttercream icing in the cake decorating book that I have ([*Professional Cake Decorating* by Toba Garrett](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Cake-Decorating-Toba-Garrett/dp/0470380098)). It's like an American buttercream, but with a 2:1 ratio of butter to shortening instead of just butter; the shortening is what makes the frosting white and stiffer. Meringue powder is added to make it stiffer, and gelatin can be added in to make it even stiffer. \n\nHere's the recipe from the book:\n\n***Decorator's buttercream icing***\n\nNote: This recipe is for a 5-6 qt mixer\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 lb of unsalted butter, 80-81% butterfat (higher butterfat and/or cultured butter like European style will cause your frosting to be more yellow and less stiff)\n\n* 8 oz (1/2 lb) of solid vegetable shortening\n\n* 7.5 grams (~1.5 teaspoon) of flavored extract (lemon, vanilla, almond, etc.)\n\n* 5 grams of salt; volume measurements will vary depending on the coarseness of the salt you use, but 5 grams of Morton's kosher salt is 1 tsp (Diamond's and Morton's are the brands available nationally in the US, and Diamond's is coarser than Morton's so I can't vouch for the measurement if you use Diamond's). \n\n* 3 lb of 10x confectioner's sugar (10x means the finest sugar you can get) \n\n* 3/4 oz (~3 tablespoon or 21 grams) of meringue powder\n\n* 4.5 fl oz of water, milk, heavy cream, or clear liqueur\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Place the butter and shortening in a mixer and mix on medium-high speed with a paddle attachment until the fats are smooth and lightened up in color. \n\n2. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowls, then cream for another minute.\n\n3. Add the flavoring and salt, then mix until combined. \n\n4. Gradually add the sugar, then the meringue powder; the mixture will appear dry. \n\n5. Add the liquid and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.\n\nStorage: Cover the buttercream with plastic wrap, and make sure the plastic wrap is touching the frosting. It can be stored wrapped and in an airtight container for up to two weeks, or frozen for up to three months. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm personally not a fan of shortening because it has a higher melting point than the average body temperature so I find that it has an odd texture when it's used. However, in this ratio, I do not think that the textural issue is as pronounced as it would be if the ratio is higher. If this frosting is not stiff enough for you, you can increase the ratio of shortening to make it even stiffer, but expect the texture (thus flavor) to become more unpleasant as the frosting will not melt properly in most people's mouth. \n\nI'd personally prefer to use an Italian buttercream, which is pretty similar to the Swiss buttercream that many people have recommended, but it differs in the preparation while the concept is essentially the same (it's a meringue with butter beaten into it). I prefer Italian buttercream to Swiss buttercream because I have more consistent results with it, but when done properly, there is a negligible difference, at least in my opinion. It will not be as stiff as the decorator's icing, but it is pretty stiff.  \n\nHere's the recipe I use for Italian buttercream; you may need to add gelatin to it to make it stiffer. You can also replace some of the butter with shortening, but expect the same issues that I described earlier with shortening. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Italian buttercream frosting***\n\nAdapted from [*Bouchon Bakery*](http://bouchonbakery.com/book). However, I added in a lot of extra little notes that I've personally picked up as I've learned how to cook (I've also made this frosting recipe like a hundred times throughout the past year). Keep in mind the information about room temperature from my [previous comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1bm7mp/sad_collapsed_cupcakes_with_broken_frosting_where/c980dy9). It takes me about 20 minutes to make this, but I'd expect your first attempt to take like 40 mins or so. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 75-85 grams of egg white (should be a little bit less than three large eggs worth of egg whites; you can probably get away with just using three large egg whites)\n\n* A very small amount of some acid like a pinch of cream of tarter, or a few drops of some liquid acid, like lemon juice, white vinegar, etc. \n\n* 188 grams of white sugar, split into 150 grams and 33 grams (200 grams in a cup) \n\n* A little bit of corn syrup (optional); it helps prevent sugar crystals from forming \n\n* Roughly 50 grams of water (50 mL, ~2 fl oz) \n\n* 8 oz of unsalted butter (224.6 grams, 2 sticks, 1 cup, etc.); aim for 80-81% butterfat, which should be the ones that are most commonly available at your grocery store. European style or cultured butter will work too, although the frosting will come out a little bit more yellow, and the higher fat content butter will cause a more buttery taste to your frosting (which may sound appealing to you, but I personally like a cleaner taste in my frosting). The butter should be cut into 1/2 inch cubes and be at room temperature\n\n* Flavoring of your desire and to taste; for example, 1-2 tsp of vanilla extract or paste. \n\nNote: For chocolate frosting, melt 2.5 oz of ~60% cacao chocolate, aka bittersweet (use the block kind, not chips unless you're sure that the chips do not have additives to help them hold their shape), although bittersweet can mean chocolates with 80% or even higher cacao content, if such chocolates are used, then you should only require 2 oz of it. It'll cool down while you prepare the frosting, which is desirable, but it should not return to a solid. \n\n**Directions** \n\nNote: For you first time through, make sure you have all your ingredients measured and ready to go (mise en place prepped) before you attempt it. As you get more experienced with it, you can separate the egg whites and other stuff while your syrup heats. \n\n1. Combine the 150 grams of sugar, corn syrup, and water together in a small sauce pot; the taller and narrower the pot, the better.\n\n2. Heat the mixture over medium to high heat (the exact range will depend on your stove) until the temperature reads 230\u00b0F (this is why tall and narrow is good, because the temperature is hard to read if your probe barely sticks into the syrup when it's heating).\n\n3. When the syrup reaches 230\u00b0F, start beating the egg whites on medium to medium high speed. When some bubbles start to form, then start adding the 33 grams of sugar in slowly. Keep whipping until the egg whites just start to form soft peaks (you don't want soft peaks exactly; the white should just start to become opaque and turn white, but they won't necessarily hold a peak). The syrup should be at 248 degrees F at this point, but if it's not, then turn the mix onto its lowest speed setting. \n\n4. Once the syrup is at 248\u00b0F, then turn the mixer to medium high, and start drizzling the syrup into the egg whites. This is the tricky part, as you have to try and aim between the whisk and the bowl, directly into the egg whites, because the syrup will cool and harden if it hits either. However, it is safer to go more towards the bowl than towards the whisk as the whisk will automatically fling the syrup to the side while the bowl will tend to have some whites that have been beaten up towards it, thus allowing the syrup to sink back into the meringue. \n\n5. Continue beating the whites until stiff peaks are formed.\n\n6. Feel the bowl, it should not be warm to the touch. If it is, turn the mixer to low, and allow the meringue to cool down. If not, then turn the mixer to medium, and begin adding the butter 2-3 cubes at a time, until all the butter is added. \n\n7. Add your flavoring of choice. \n\nShelf life: The frosting will keep well for ~5 days in the refrigerator, provided that it's covered with plastic wrap, with the wrap touching the frosting, and also stored in an airtight container. If stored in the same manner, it can last for at least 2 months in the freezer. No matter how you chose to store it, allow it to return to room temperature before using; if the texture is not light enough for you after storage, then re-whip the frosting before use.  </p>",

It might be a meringue but my Asian pastry chef friends tell me it is indeed whipped topping. Ive seen a type of buttercream that performs like this but unfortunately i do not have the recipe.  A few CMB's came to my job and the prepared it.  Specifically a gentleman named Noble Masi, he taught at the CIA for many years and has a book...might be in there.  Personally i would try the whipped topping thing first.  Also I feel like ive typed out Whipped Topping too many times.  Enjoy the random capitalization of that last one</p>",

Everything in the fridge should be covered at all times just to prevent cross-contamination. \n\n\n* Do not store meat and vegetables together for added protection. Give them separate spots in the fridge.\n\n\n* Root vegetables will last a long while in your fridge and should be stored in the proper compartments, usually labeled, if your fridge has them because they control for humidity.\n\n\n* Do not store heavy items in the fridge door or you can look forward to having to get it repaired in a couple of years from the weight bearing down on it. Also, the fridge door is not for storing items that can easily spoil because the temperature fluctuates. I keep condiments and the occasional drink there, and nothing else.\n\n\n* In general, cooked leftovers not containing seafood last two to three days. Cooked meat alone can go four days to a week, depending on how well done it is. See spacekataza's comment on chicken. That also applies to all poultry.\n\n\n* Freeze fresh, bakery bread to keep it fresh longer. It will turn the time a loaf gets stale from three days to seven or eight.\n\n\n* Raw meat can generally be refrigerated for three days, then you either have to cook it or freeze it. On the same note, ground meat has a much shorter shelf life and should theoretically be cooked the day you bought it or frozen.\n\n\n* The freezer should be used for long-term storage. Dairy should be used before it spoils instead of attempting to freeze it, the one exception being butter. Do not freeze eggs. Vegetables and fruits in general need some minor prep/cook time before going into the freezer. Google each item. \n\n\n\nEdited for grammar because what is spelling</p>",

It tested as one of the top quality oils on the market and is super cheap. (Uc Davis study report here http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/news-events/news/files/oliveoilappendix071510.pdf)\n-dried chiles from the latin american aisle. A big bag is ~$1 and we like them better than the stuff we get from the farmers market\n-asian brand condiments (cheapest at asian markets) sriracha, three crabs brand fish sauce, and datu puti brand coconut vinegar. All are both cheaper and better than brands marketed to Americans.\n-deli containers for food storage instead of plastic wrap or Tupperware (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007V2V0IQ). These are what the restaurant uses and they are amazing.\n-black box wine for cooking, but we get even cheaper/better stuff by making friends with local wine store guys and getting their recs for sub-$10 bottles\n-bulk dry beans: more annoying than canned but so much cheaper\n\nThings we pay for:\n-Spices. Grocery store spices are poor quality, expensive, and stale- even at whole foods. Instead buy from spice stores like penzeys.com or thespicehouse.com. Don't  pay for glass containers, buy in the smallest size plastic bags they offer (2-4 oz). The price is comparable to the grocery store but quality and quantity are much, much higher bc you only pay for the spice, not the jar. By the way if you do this, get the Spanish smoked paprika and add it to everything, it will change your life.\n-high quality (organic/grass fed) eggs/dairy/cheese, as many have mentioned\n-coffee (whole bean, recently roasted)/tea (whole leaf)/beer (craft/micro)\n-local/in season fish\n\nBy the way, there's an awesome book on this subject called an economist gets lunch.

This is the one you want if you fancy a quick tapas with your beer - just thinly slice a bit off, a bit of bread, and you're done.\n\n* The \"raw\" stuff will always be in the refrigerated section, often as part of a pack for making cocido / lentejas / etc.  You need to cook this stuff - it's great fried, or as part of the one of the aforementioned stews. (It's not exactly raw, just less time curing, but needs cooking so it's a convenient way to think of it).\n\nApart from chorizo there's also fuet and salchichon, which are much darker and always cured; morcilla (black pudding), which is usually \"raw\" and needs cooking; and then there are \"tropecientos\" other varieties of sausages, often depending on where in Spain you live. (If you let me know I can probably suggest what you should be looking out for locally).\n\nEdit: should also mention another variable: spiciness. Chorizo uses piment\u00f3n to get it's characteristic colour, and this can be either spicy or \"sweet\". This is usually shown on the label. </p>",

It's no big deal, but maybe pull off any loose bits that might come up when slicing it.\nAlso, with regard to cooking the oil out of it, some friends and I went camping last summer and instead of taking oil to cook with we just bought a chorizo and cooked everything in the oil from it.

Many restaurants get the meet in a fine grind in a 10 lb tube and just slice the burgers out. \n\nThe grind size.\nAs I said, many restaurants are getting a fine grind.

The thing that really sets it apart to most people though is that I use actual chunks of meat instead of ground. When you let it simmer for as many hours as you've got those chunks pretty much fall apart anyway but I think it gives it a much heartier, satisfying texture.

Try adding an extra egg white or two if you don't want to use regular milk, although albumin will give a more rubbery texture than caseins.\n\n3. You need more sugar for browning.  1 tsp per cup of flour is generally what to aim for.\n\n4. You need to drop the acidity of your batter for browning.  2 tsp of baking soda is not enough to 'use up' 2 tbsp of vinegar, especially when you use almond milk instead of regular milk (less buffering capacity in my experience).\n\n5. Your griddle probably isn't hot enough -- this (along with too much liquid) is why you're getting pudding instead of pancakes.  Yes, for thicker pancakes you need a slightly lower temp so they cook through before over-browning.  But you can compensate by raising the pH of your batter, and by adding a little more sugar when making your batter.\n\nFWIW, my pancakes use roughly 1.5:1 ratio of flour to milk -- and I use at least half whole-grain flours which need more liquid.</p>",

Buying ingredients to create a dish of restaurant quality for two people, as is in my household,  always costs more; because some fresh ingredients, must be bought in larger quantities than actually needed, and you run into the problem of them spoiling by time you need them again.  Plus the amount of time it takes to do the preparation for all of your cooking is much longer than the amount of time it takes to go to the restaurant and have someone else cook it for you.  This is why restaurants exist.\n\n\n\n\nBut if money is not an issue, and you have quality ingredients and the time to use them, here is a list of some items that might help you cook food at home to a restaurant quality:  \n\n\n\nChef knife; Pairing knife; Steel; heavy bottomed oven-safe saut\u00e9 pans; heavy bottomed oven-safe sauce pots; cutting boards; vegetable peeler; kitchen scissors; food processor that has detachable cheese grater attachment; heavy duty blender; fine mesh strainer; tongs; towels or pot holders; lots of kosher salt; unsalted butter; all-purpose flour; corn starch; granulated sugar; whole black pepper; ground white pepper; cream; white wine; sherry; red wine; butchers twine; parchment paper; sheet pan; foil; oil; whisk; fish spatula; ~~chinese~~ japanese mandolin; kitchen timer; and last but not least, a food thermometer.  \n\n\n\nThis is a brief list of items we use almost daily in our restaurant.  you won't need every item on the list for every restaurant quality meal, but if you have the right ones and use them in the right applications; you'll have a pretty good shot at creating restaurant quality dishes at home!\n\nEdit: words\n\nEdit 2:  finally not at work and can actually type on a laptop.</p>",

I believe it was also so the customer could see the color of the tail, so if it was pink you could be certain that it was cooked through, rather than if it was still [blue/grey/raw shrimp colored](http://louisianadirectseafood.com/images/freshwhiteshrimp.jpg).\n\nI know I heard all of that somewhere, but I feel like I'm swimming against the current on this one... there should be more to back it up and I can't seem to find anyone saying this.

When you pick up the shrimp tail, pinch it right at the very bottom, where the last tail segment transitions from meat to shell/fins. When you bite, pull as you bite, and pinch with your fingers.

Participants are separated into two groups. One group is asked to pick out the shortest word, while the other is told to pick the word that is different from the rest. All the string of words are related, e.g. 1) sea, ocean, sand, water 2) sugar, salt, pepper, milk. The participants are then told to recount as many words as possible. Guess which group can remember more words?\n\nWhen we focus on some silly thing like the number of letters, we focus on them so much that we don't even look at the meaning of the words. They're just random letters strung together. But once you think about the words, about what they mean, they stick with you. \n\nStop focusing on the directions. Focus on what is going on. Cook the onions for x minutes? NO NO NO NO NO. Look at what's going on. Cook until the onions are translucent? Why? To soften them up. Cook until the onions are brown? Why? To give them that sweet, caramelized flavor. How do we achieve these things? Cook using high heat or low heat? Why? \n\nI want to make this food. I don't remember the exact recipe, but I remember the taste. It was very sweet and savory. I should probably brown the onions. The last time I tried to caramelize onions using high heat, they burned, so I should use a lower heat. \n\nIf you're not doing this, every time you \"learn\" a recipe, you start from zero. Learning is best when you build a framework from what you already know. If I tell you \"a pomelo is a large orange fruit with a soft, thick, bitter rind, and segmented flesh with seeds in each pod\" you will get confused if you don't already know what a pomelo is. If I tell you \"a pomelo is like a grapefruit\", you immediately understand what kind of fruit it is. Why? Because you're learning something by connecting it to something you already know.\n\nI want to bang my head on the wall when my friends struggle with college material that was already covered in high school. Or even when using something from earlier in the semester. Holy shit, you learned how to calculate probability in the first half of the semester, and now you need to calculate probabilities using Markov chains, and you FORGOT how to use simple probability? These types of people memorize formulas without ever understanding what he formula means. Simple probability is so intuitive if you understand how you calculate it, instead of using a formula.\n\nTl;dr focus on the meaning, not on the words.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Red beans and rice and gumbo are two instances of foods where you can't really use a recipe, or rather you can but can't solely rely on the recipe.  \n\nWhat's the objective of cooking food?  to eat something delicious.  So how do you cook without a recipe?  You cook something 'til it's delicious.  That sounds trite but it's true.  A recipe is a guideline to get you there, but thanks to usually significant variations (e.g. with red beans how long to soak the beans, how long to cook them, how much to season them) the best stuff is never cooked precisely to a recipe.  Ever seen one that says \"cook onions for ten minutes, or until golden brown\"?  If you cook onions for ten minutes they will not be golden brown.  \n\nThe only way to do it is to do it.  Red beans are an excellent way to start because they're cheap and hard to screw up.  They'll either be bland, which you can fix, or undercooked, which you can also fix.  As long as you don't leave them for too long at too high a heat and burn them, or add in a pile of cayenne, you'll be OK.  \n\nThe keys to getting away from a recipe are (a) taste, taste, taste, and (b) approach the dish from more of an idea of who's bringing what to the party.  \n\n(a) is fairly self-explanatory, but the critical thing is to check seasoning by continually tasting until it's where you want it to be.  \n\n(b) we'll approach RQ with an eye towards red beans.  Clearly the focus of the dish should be your beans.  Some people like them whole; others like them broken.  Which you prefer will change how long you cook them.  \n\nNow, I like to add onion, garlic, celery and bell pepper to my red beans because I think that gives it a better flavor.  How much?  No clue.  Enough so they don't outshine the red beans, but not so little you don't taste anything.  Otherwise, you can't really screw up - very rarely is somebody upset that there's too much or too little of either.  \n\nRed beans also benefit from meat.  I like sausage or ham hocks, but especially ham hocks.  Ham hocks take a lot of cooking, so you want to make sure to add them early.  Again, there's no set guideline for how long to cook them--until they fall apart, generally.  How many?  Well, again, it's hard to go wrong unless you add so many the whole thing is covered in rendered pork fat, and that would be a challenge.  \n\nGood luck with your efforts and in general, stick to dishes that are forgiving and cheap.  Red beans are perfect for that.  Once you get a couple fundamentals down, you'll be branching out in no time.  </p>",

                "answer": "<p>>Are there practical steps I can take to learn the skills to cook more freely? \n\nKeep cooking with recipes. Seriously. That's how you get the experience to learn how things go together, what works, what doesn't work. It's the same with anything else: first you learn how to do needlepoint or bookbinding or repairing cars or figure skating with the manual, and then after you've got the basics down, you can expand into doing it without step-by-step instructions.\n\nHave your dad cook his amazing red beans and rice while you follow him around, and either video him, or write down everything that he does. Video is better, because he's going to do things like toss in a handful of this and a dollop of that, so you'll need to stop him and say, \nWait, show me what that is that you're putting in. But if you say, Let me get a measuring cup and measure how much of that you're putting in, he'll get very cross, and he'll lose his momentum. So, video him meticulously, have the camera follow his hands, everything he does, and speak aloud with notes to yourself, \"Okay now he just dumped in a can of Kroger brand red beans\".\n\nThen sit down later with the video and deconstruct it. Make notes of what he did, and a guess at the proportions, and then try to cook it yourself.\n\nThere also needs to be, in your mind, a distinction between \"cooking\" and \"baking\". Baking, as in cakes and cookies (but not bread), is much more recipe-dependent, because the proportions of things like fat, moisture, leavening agent like baking powder or baking soda, can be crucial, and if you get them wrong, your cake or cookies come out...strange. So baking is something you pretty much need recipes for.\n\nCooking, however, is what Gordon Ramsay and your dad do, and cooking is indeed something that you can learn to do without having to follow recipes. But you only learn to do that by following recipes for a while, to learn how it all works.\n\nRed beans and rice is actually quite easy to cook; I encourage you to follow your dad around and see what he does, then try to re-create it.  It will most likely not come out exactly the same, but that is because you're new.  And you and he can have some good bonding time while you're going back to him to pick his brain for how he does it, because most parents (and grandparents) who cook love nothing more than to be asked for their recipes.\n\nThere are tons and tons of how-to videos on Youtube. Pick a skill you want to master, say peeling potatoes or sharpening knives or cutting up stew meat, Search, and somebody's got a video up, showing you how. There are specific recipe videos from all kinds of people, for all kinds of food.\n\nJulia Child's shows are the gold standard for instructional videos.  \nYou can learn things from the Food Network chefs.  \nIndividual chefs like Gordon Ramsay have Youtube videos.  \n\nAnd there's this.  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CIANetwork</p>",

Then I started cooking almost all my meals from scratch.  I was forced to figure it out and be more proactive with my recipes...or waste a lot of food.  Turns out, not every published recipe is written by a genius.  :O\n\nFirst, practice, practice, practice, and observe.  When a recipe doesn't work out, what specifically do you think went wrong?  What might have been done differently, ingredient or step, that would have made the difference between bleh and awesome?  Is it flavor, texture, or something else?  Take notes, write down thoughts and ideas.  Over time you start to slowly learn specific techniques that work and those that don't.\n\nLet me give you an example:\n\nIn stir fries some recipes say to add the garlic first to a hot pan or wok.  Now I've learned from experience (and a stinky kitchen) that I will get burnt nasty, bitter garlic doing that.  Once I figured that out, I just started adding it later, no matter what the recipe says, so that it could soften and sweeten, but not burn.\n\nThen I saw recipe (in some blog, I think) for a new technique where the oil is heated to fairly hot, then the pan is removed from the heat.  After a moment or two to let the oil cool, add the garlic and stir until it just starts to lightly change color.  You get more garlic flavor infused into the oil this way.  Then back on the heat and stir in other food right away to keep the garlic away from direct heat.  Worked beautifully, and now I do that every time I stir fry, no matter what the recipe says to do.\n\nI have added other techniques such as this to my arsenal over time, just from trial and error.  Things like getting a good crust on meat, or deglazing a pan, brining meat, etc. etc.  Each one I learn gets incorporated into recipes I try out.  Eventually, new recipes are merely inspiration or a guideline, not a rule book.\n\nThe take home here is it just takes time and practice.  Try to notice certain common themes in recipes (such as, are you browning the meat? Is it a braise?  Are you going to want to deglaze the pan?) and figure out which techniques gave you the best results for these steps.  Apply to other dishes.  \n\nAs far as ingredients and flavors, don't sweat the small stuff so much.  Learn what things are sweet, salty, sour, spicy, or have umami.  With practice, you will learn what substitutions work and what doesn't.  Google is a decent resource for this as well.  \n\nAnd finally, I always adjust seasoning when I'm done with a recipe, and I'm not just talking about salt.  With practice you start to get a feel for what kind of additives are appropriate.  Too sour or spicy?  Add a touch of sweetener.  Too flat?  Maybe a squeeze of lime would bring out the flavors.  And so on.  Don't be afraid to take a little out and experiment until you're more confident with your choices.  Flavor adjustment is a very valuable thing to practice and learn.\n</p>",

The biggest part of this is word of mouth. It used to be newspaper reviews, but these days it has to be social media. Issue coupons, have specials, hang a sign bigger than Jesus, just get people in the door. Location can be a drawback here. Half the restaurants people tell me that went out of business prompt me to say \"What? I didn't know there was a restaurant there.\" If that's your restaurant, you were doomed to fail. \n\n*#2 Once people are in the door, you have to give provide them with a good experience. Food is only a part of this! Seating should be prompt. Staff should be friendly but not chatty. Even if the food is mind-blowingly great, it should provide a value to the customer. People like to experience a restaurant. Don't be boring. Don't be annoying. Don't be dirty. Don't suck. The restaurant is the golden platter that the food lays upon. Try to make it special. \n\n*#3 The staff. Management has to have a serious head on its shoulders. Kitchens are hotbeds of human drama. When I worked in a kitchen, the staff was having sex with the staff. The waitresses were doing coke in the bathroom. The dishwasher was selling weed out the back door. It's chaos. The management has to have the reins of that rodeo. They have to reward the good and trim the bad. It has to be harsh but fair. Not many people fit the mold of a restaurant manager. Things can go south very, very quickly.\n\n*#4 The food. I've put up with restaurants which failed on points 1 through 3 simply because I love their food. You have a restaurant. You are allowed to try to amaze me with food. You are not allowed to serve cold, unseasoned, dirty, nasty, average bullshit. And be honest. If a menu item sucks, cut it. I hate restaurants where the menu is too big. No cook or chef can do everything well. Make it narrow, but special. Don't try to be everything to everyone. If the people love it, listen to them and move in that direction. Do what you do, and do it well. \n\nIf you meet all those criteria, I *may* visit your restaurant more than once.</p>",

Striking a balance between those is the easiest way to develop a 'complete' tasting dish. This doesn't necessarily mean each component needs all qualities, but instead, each component should compliment each other in some way, based on these. Bitter veg, savory meat, salty sauce, sour garnish.\n\nThe cooking methods matter a lot in this. A long, slow cooked dish can often end up with dull flavors, and benefit from a hit of acid at the end, like a quick wine reduction or splash of citrus. A fast-cook dish like grilled or stir fried dishes can lack complexity, so you add soy or cheese for that deep savory characteristic.\n\nAlso keep in mind textural balance. Finding a crunchy element is what can give a very satisfying and well-rounded pop to a dish.</p>",

The more saturated fatty acids an oil has, the higher its melting point. In other words, the more solid it tends to be at room temperature. For example, palm oil, which has mostly saturated fatty acids, is semi-solid at room temperature.\n\nBasically, a fat is a chain of carbon with hydrogen attached to each side. A monounsaturated fat acid is missing one hydrogen, a polyunsaturated is missing several. These open links want to attach to something, and if it is something bad, the oil can go rancid.\n\nSaturated fats have a much more stable shelf life, so they are popular with food companies. If you chemically put hydrogen atoms in the gaps, you get a partially hydrogenated fat, which stays solid at room temperature, like crisco and margarine. Adding a bit to peanut butter keeps it from separating, and extends shelf life.\n\nPartially hydrogenated fats are also known as trans fatty acids, which you hear so much press about, and are somehow different than naturally saturated fats, like lard and coconut fat.\n\nThere are various health regimes touting the different benefits of monounsaturated vs polyunsaturated fats, but I'm still looking for a good scientific paper on this.\n\nCommon monounsaturated fats are, in no order; olive, canola, peanut, safflower, sesame.\n\n**TL/DR** you friend need to get over themselves and come up with some science.</p>",

If somewhere is taking 30 minutes to bring your drinks or appetizers, that might be a problem, but if the next course after that takes 30 minutes, that's far preferable to a 5 minute wait.\n\nOn a side note, service grabbing your empty plate before the rest of the table is finished seems very rude to me.

The sooner you're out the door the sooner your table opens up to other paying customers.\n\nI think restos in the US have a very low profit margin for food (I read drinks have a higher profit margin), so the more \"tables\" that are covered in a shift, the more potential profit is generated.\n\nAlso, if you are eating in a corporate chain restaurant in the US, such as an Applebee's or Chipotle, the corporations have devised a lot of strategies to maximize profit; they put a lot of thought into that.\n\nIf you're eating at a mom-and-pop, where the owners may also own the building they're in, then service can be slower without jeopardizing too much profit. There's an Argentine restaurant we go to here (USA) that has only eight tables, takes its time serving food and is usually sold-out, meaning reservations are the only way to get in. It takes two hours minimum to eat; reminiscent of our living in Europe.</p>",

After chilling in the fridge, I added granulated sugar and crusted it. I was using a Searzall & the heat wasn't right for the size of ramekin (sugar droplets & burning) so I just used a torch on the rest and had better luck. However, the screwed up ramekin looks like the custard never set (seen here tilted, room temp and without the burned crust http://imgur.com/FR8bgun ). \n\nFirst question, has anyone tried this method & had better luck with a different temperature? Second question, what happened to this ramekin? I'm thinking I managed to break the custard with too much heat since the others came out fine, but I thought custards get harder with more heat. \n\nEdit: asking because we have custard mix reserved for tonight & I'd like to not screw up any more :) ! </p>",

De Cecco uses a [slow drying process](http://www.dececcousa.com/DeCecco-way/?Pagina_Mondo=6) which yields a different product, and this drying process is one of the many reasons why De Cecco believes that their pasta is superior to many other pastas available. \n\nI agree with them, and I find De Cecco very difficult to overcook. It retains its shape much better than other brands, and has a better bite than a lot of pastas out there. Whether or not this difference makes it better is up to you, but I use De Cecco for most of my shaped pasta needs (I don't use De Cecco for string shaped pasta as I bought a pasta roller and intend to get my money's worth for it by making fresh pasta). </p>",

Frozen hash browns are usually used and that's what they are; cooked, cooled, and shredded potatoes. \nLets look at the science driving this technique. Potatoes are almost all water. That water has to be driven out of the potato for it to brown. It would be impossible for a restaurant to produce hash browns on a large scale if raw potatoes were placed on a griddle. You need to precook them to serve them efficiently. Another important factor is the consistency of the final product. Besides water potatoes are made up of a starch. Without going into detail that raw starch has to be converted into something palatable. This is done with heat, the starch \"melts\" then when cooling gelatinizes and holds its shape in a new and un \" melting\" way. Most vegetables respond in this way. Pasta, carrots potatoes are blanched, shocked (cooled) and added to soups and they retain their shape when reheating. This is what you want with a hash brown. Fully cooked starch. A non mushy interior and a crisp exterior. Soooo\nBake, boil, or steam a potato  that cooks the starch and drives out moisture. Cool the potato. That sets the starch. Shred. Then pan fry forming a patty and flipping once. \nI hope that helps. I promise you that you will never go back to shredding raw potatoes, squeezing and frying. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I see quite a few people are recommending juices. One thing I would watch out for if you are doing juice is to get a machine that will blend up the entire fruit/vegetable instead of just juicing it and leaving all the fiber behind. Blood sugar can easily spike and crash on a liquid diet, so making sure you've got fiber in your system can keep your energy at a more stable and steady rate. \n\nIf you can get some beef bones from a butcher or good grocery store that will make excellent hearty stock.\n\nThrow in some seeds and nuts when you are doing fruit and veggie smoothies. Nut butters are also good for this.\n\nDon't forget about fats and oils, they are essential! Coconut oil would be a good choice here since it doesn't actually need bile to be broken down and absorbed by the intestines. It will be easiest on her system (and tastes great in smoothies!).\n\nAmaranth (if you can find it) is a really tasty grain to use in smoothies. It has a nice nutty flavor without any of the bitterness that you can find in quinoa. Amaranth, coconut milk, berries, and cinnamon (and maybe a banana) would be a nice and filling morning meal.\n\nGood luck, six weeks is a long time!</p>",

There are also examples of different tastes together and examples of them. \n\nIt also goes on about how smell affects taste and some of the different compounds that give certain foods their characteristic smell.\n\nIt also has all kinds of useful scientific information on cooking processes.What temperature changes happen at, why and how they happen, and recipes that actually explain why you're doing each step; some molecular gastronomy; and an awesome part called \"fun with hardware\". \n\nThat book really improved my cooking and baking abilities, and it also gave me much more courage to experiment with flavour combinations. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Here is what you're going to do: you're going to cheat.\n\nFirst, buy [Sodium Citrate.](http://www.amazon.com/Grade-Sodium-Citrate-Molecular-Gastronomy/dp/B00BLPNMYY/ref=sr_1_2/179-0319031-3009651?ie=UTF8&qid=1395009082&sr=8-2&keywords=sodium+citrate) Sodium citrate is a very powerful emulsifier, and will let you make cheese sauce of a perfect consistency with no guesswork, using just cheese and, well, that's pretty much it. The result is a sauce where the cheese flavor is not covered up by milk or butter.\n\nThere are a lot of recipes that you can find online using sodium citrate, but in my experience the best is this: boil 1lb of dry pasta to just shy of al dente in salted water, drain but reserve the pasta liquid, add 1-1.5 cups of the pasta liquid back in, add 1Tbsp sodium citrate, then *gradually*, mixing as you go, add 1lb of shredded cheese. Use whatever cheese or combination of cheeses you like, use more cheese if you want a saucier mac and less cheese if you want a less saucy mac. You'll probably need to add more liquid--if you do, use beer, wine or the pasta liquid, and only add a bit at a time. Mix everything up well over low heat and you'll get a perfectly creamy mac and cheese with intense cheese flavor. You can also add spices and other flavors--I like a little hot sauce, a little garlic powder, a little paprika and a teaspoon or two of brown sugar. \n\nThis sauce will never, ever break. You can try your best to break it but it won't happen, and if it does just add another pinch of sodium citrate, heat it up, mix it together and problem solved. So stick it in a casserole dish, top it with bread crumbs or cheese, and bake it just the same way you would a normal mac and cheese!</p>",

The first time I tried it, it was like the cheese smacked me right in the face.  It was fantastic - if you're a cheese lover and are sick of non cheesy mac n cheese, then this is for you.\n\nNext, find a combo of cheeses that works best for you.  I find that a lot of people make a fairly one note mac n cheese.  This can be fine - if you just want to taste cheddar, that's totally cool, but sometimes a good combo can do wonders.\n\nAnd finally, I melt a little butter in a saute pan and toss in the panko, a little salt, and usually some garlic powder.  Straight up panko is fine, but I've found that adding a little fat makes a difference.  And if you want, maybe a light dusting of pecorino romano or parm on top.</p>",
