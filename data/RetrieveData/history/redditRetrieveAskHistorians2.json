                "answer": "<p>I wouldn't be surprised if there are more swimming events that Phelps competes in than ancient events as a whole. There were three fighting events: boxing, wrestling, and pankration (a combination of the two, maybe a bit like MMA). Two riding events: chariot and horeseracing. Four different running events (including the race in armor), and the pentathalon. So I think it is a *bit* unfair to Leonidas.\n\nThe one that comes to mind is Phayllos of Kroton, who leapt so far he cleared the pit and broke his leg. As the pit was about fifteen meters long, this is well beyond the 8.9 Mike Powell managed in Barcelona. That being said, the sheer size of this leap has made plenty of people a bit leery, and it does seem to be straining against the limits of the possible, and so there is a bit of a debate over what the long jump was actually like. One possibility is that the weighted [halteres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halteres_(ancient_Greece\\)) that the athletes apparently held while jumping was used in some way to add lift or effect the center of gravity, but modern testing hasn't really provided a comparable effect. The simpler explanation is that it was just a triple jump, which makes 15 meters extremely impressive but well within the 18.3 meters that is the current record.\n\nIf you want to read more, Leuven has a great little site about the Olympics, I linked [Phyllos' page](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/tp018en.html).\n\nEDIT: it is worth noting that event athletics became proffessionalized to an extent during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were enough places hosting games that it was possible for a talented athlete to make a comfortable living going from Games to Games and surviving off of the prize money. By contrast the competitors of the classical games were young aristocratic amateurs, so I find it pretty likely that the quality of competition was much higher in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but authors primarily primarily talked about the classical games.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I can talk about several denominations within Christianity in Canada from the 50s onwards. These denominations (spec. Baptists, Mennonites, and CMA/CAMA, tended to be, and still tend to be, more conservative than other groups with Canada, including the RC church, Anglicans, and so on--though the latter are not my area of expertise). Please note that when I refer to \"Baptists\", I'm not referring to the Southern Baptist movement within the United States. ~~Rather, I'm talking about Canadian descendants of the Anabaptist movement in 16C. They may have similar roots but frankly I don't know.~~\n\nPutting aside dietary restrictions for a moment, in the third quarter of the 20th century (so 1950-1975) there were strong taboos against men with long hair (1 Cor 11.14) and tattoos (Lev 19.28) in mainstream Baptist, Mennonite, and CMA congregations in Western Canada. Sermons were preached about it in many churches over many years. The same goes for tattoos, which were seen as unacceptable unless a church member were an adult convert. While the taboo against long hair grew less influential in the 80s, the taboo against tattoos lasted longer. \n\nThe question is, to what extent did existing religious norms influence society as a whole, as long hair, certainly, was seen to be a part of youthful rebellion. In smaller communities within AB, BC, and SK (and even larger centres such as Lethbridge), many businesses were simply closed on Sundays during this quarter. I would argue that, the more religious the community, the more influence that the church had upon individual towns, to the extent that Biblical precepts against working on the Sabbath influenced the culture as a greater whole. (Some of those restrictions, closures on Sunday in particular, still have ramifications today, but that's beyond the scope of this subreddit.)\n\nHomosexuality within these groups was simply not tolerated, and abortion... well, that's an interesting topic, as the laws on abortion in Canada were loosened in 1967 as a result of Pierre Trudeau, himself influenced by the Quiet Revolution in the 60s (which saw a shift in societal values away from the Roman Catholic church and towards secularism). While abortion was quasi-legal at that time, it was still largely decried by many Christian churches within Canada, including Baptists and Mennonite groups, and CAMA/CMA (The Christian and Missionary Alliance). \n\nThere may be individual congregations with exceptions to the above rule, but looking at statements of belief from this era (and God help me but I can't find any of my old textbooks in which this was discussed... we're talking about mimeograph copies from provincial assemblies of the aforementioned groups, and I have no idea where they are), the above is by and large true.\n\nSo: the above groups largely condemned homosexuality (let alone gay marriage) and abortion, as well as tattoos, working on Sundays, and long hair for men. Consistent so far. Back to dietary restrictions: speaking of Christianity, there are no longer any dietary restrictions, period. In Acts 10 & 11, Peter has a vision in which God essentially tells him that it's okay to eat anything, that the old dietary laws of the Old Testament no longer applied. This is why Christians in general have no issue with eating anything, and that's a blanket statement that applies worldwide (with a few minor exceptions, such as Messianic Jews). \n\nI understand that this is a very limited answer from a very limited geographical area within North America. I apologise for my lack of sources, but little on this can be found online outside of regional paper archives, and those are spread out and difficult to access on a Sunday afternoon (heh). The texts to which I have access, including *Readings in Baptist History: Four Centuries of Selected Documents* by Joseph Early and *Tracks and Traces: Baptist Identity in Church and Theology* by Paul Fiddes are broader and the former *does* talk about Southern Baptists; this would be a useful resource to look at belief statements from larger organising bodies. My post is related more towards *a posteriori* experiences in individual congregations in the latter part of the 20th century in W. Canada.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>[1/2]\n\nI know, I know, reddit gloms onto anything that smells of religion and hypocrisy. But bear with me, because the intellectual and political developments in play are important to *understanding*, beyond any gut jerk condemnation or automatic acceptance.\n\nThe story that Christians tell themselves, passed down in the Book of Acts and some of the New Testament epistles, is that Jesus came and fulfilled the Law, that is, the Old Testament. It's pretty clear in context that the critical issue was nascent Christianity's built in mission (evangelization) imperative juxtaposed with Jewish prescriptions, most importantly circumcision, although kosher laws also feature prominently in the biblical discussion.\n\nBut while what is depicted by Christian tradition as a battle between \"Jewish Christians\" and \"Gentile Christians\" ultimately comes down on the side of God apparently no longer requiring circumcision in the \"new covenant,\" this hardly means that developing Christianity shed its Jewish roots including the Old Testament, or the Hellenized Roman culture in which it incubated. Everyone's favorite example here is abortion, so let's roll with it. Early and medieval Christians recognized abortion as a moral question, connected to infanticide. But perspectives differed-and would continue to differ-on when abortion began to be a problem. Was it always immoral? Or was it only immoral after the infusion of the soul into the body? And when was that, and was it different for boys and girls? As John Riddle points out, even as one tradition that would become canon law condemned contraception and abortion, some theologians continued to repeat earlier ideas and even mention recipes for contraceptives.\n\nThe complicating and complicated, but crucial, factor is sex. Christianity inherits a deep skepticism towards sex and the human body from Greek philosophy, to the extent that Jerome (who gave us the Vulgate Bible) argues that virgins should kill themselves to avoid the pollution of *being raped*. Of course, a society without sex is self-eradicating, and Christians quickly come up with the longstanding view that sex is okay if it is in accord with nature, that is, can lead to procreation. And the wonderfully spicy Song of Songs is reinscribed as an allegory: the love song between Christ and his Church or Christ and the soul (or, because he Middle Ages love you and want you to be happy, Christ and Mary, his virgin mother).\n\nThe spread and entrenchment of thhe Latin Church as a landed power over the early high Middle Ages introduced a new wrinkle to the concept of moral authority: legal authority, and the desire to shepherd and augment it for the salvation of as many people as possible. Christians have a harder task in the establishment of religious law than Jews and Muslims, since the NT works mightily hard to reject legalism as a principle. So canon (Church) law ends up cobbled together out of the Bible, philosophers, practical situations.  It's in the efforts to codify canon law in 11-12C that theolgians start to pay attention to sodomy with a definition of (male, primarily) homosexuality. Although it is still just one form of the \"sin against nature\", and there are no signs of active persecution from Latin Christians. But the codification of canon law reflects a long term trend in the west towards social order, hierarchy, purity, playing out above all on religious (anti-Semitism) and gender policing lines (misogyny, patriarchal families, strict gender roles and gender expression norms). Homosexual sex acts stack up poorly here, as you can imagine, and by the fifteenth century it can be and sometimes was punishable by death.\n\nSo what is the Bible doing in all this? As suggested by the multivalent interpretations of the Song of Songs (totally ripped from rabbinic readings of the love been God and his chosen people, by the way), medieval biblical interpretation was majestically flexible. This could lead to things like understanding the story of Jonah as a prophecy of Christ, descending into hell for three days, as well as being the story of a man who tried to say no to God and got eaten by a fish. Or it       could mean trying to apply the \"sons of Noah\"-Shem, Japheth, Ham-as a paradigm to understand the peoples of an expanding (in Latin consciousness) world. The most famous medieval permutation here is the use of the curse of Ham to justify the existence of Latin, Christian serfdom. It often took on geographic origin meanings, however, which were as varied as the peoples of the Mediterranean world. In the early modern era, the western interpretation will harden into the \"curse of Ham\" that morally justifies the enslavement of black Africans by white Europeans and colonial descendants.\n\nBut that development, and even more its entrenchment, are somewhat of a departure in the evolution of European intellectual culture. Even as the Protestant reformers and the Catholic reaction supposedly streamline and \"harden\" biblical interpretation methods (don't worry, the Song of Songs lives on in all its meanings), first the influence of humanism and then the evolution of natural philosophy into science never quite allowed the Bible to be Clarissa Explains It All.\n\nWell, nineteenth century coming at you to change all that.\n\nAn important evolution that is actually played out in interpretations of the curse of Ham story is a growing sense that slavery is a moral issue. Not just related to religious in-group-ism, but ownership of humans in light of humanity, period. Now, it's crucial to recognize the mutually reinforcing and guiding nature of religious beliefs/morality and other circumstances, be they political, economic, environmental, what have you. Mark Noll's *The Civil War as a Theological Crisis* (which is to some extent the point towards which so much of career oriented him) lays out cleanly that the split between Christians opposed to slavery and Christians supporting it broke down along the geographic lines you would expect, but also that both sides made religion the basis for securing popular support. Abolitionists appealed to the ideals of \"liberal theology\" (not in the modern US political sense) and biblical exegesis, favoring holistic readings and the \"sense\" of scripture. Slavery's defenders huddled down into what we call proof-texting: if you can find it in the Bible, somehow someway, it's God's inerrant word. Even if there are contradictory texts. This principle-fundamentalism, literalism, inerrancy-is a 19C invention. But so is the abolitionists' holistic reading. So is Luther's the Old Testament through the cross hermeneutic. So is medieval and patristic fourfold senses (historical and three allegorical forms).\n\nAll of these developments that I've talked about-sex, literalism, holistic/critical exegesis, race, moral politics, the role of religion in galvanizing political opinion and vice versa, tumble into the 20C. If anything, the Victorian and then Progressive era and its emphasis on \"middle class values\" (an adjusted vision of rightly ordered, moral society) demonstrated even more firmly the power of religion in spurring people's political activism as well as introducing new dimensions of concern over the policing of sex and, now, \"sexuality.\" This period also saw a critical social invention in America: widespread, mandatory public education.\n\nThis was inseparable from religion, please understand. Apart from the Catholic Church's long leadership role in all levels of education and nuns as THE champions of educating girls, late 19/early 29C Catholics often perceived public schools as a covert Protestant indoctrination, hence the longstanding tradition of Catholic schools in many American cities. This is a vital precedent. Because when the US finally gets its head temporarily out of the racist sand and makes school segregation illegal, it's southern Christians in the same \"biblical inerrancy\" tradition who defended slavery, who lack qualms about expressing their racism.\n\nI choose my word carefully here. Because you can certainly cherry pick quotes from the odd Protestant leader or Southern politician who explicitly links the rise of religious (Protestant, PLEASE) schools, mainly in the south, to a desire to prolong segregation. That's not the dominant narrative, you understand. Religious freedom! Need to secure the morality of our good sons and daughters! Gosh, and don't those race based admissions requirements make it a safer environment for the children. When the segregation policies were challenged in court (Green v. Connally; Coit v. Green), it was easy to sell this as religious persecution, not the government's rightful enforcement of due civil rights. And to be clear: the issue here wasn't about the closure of the schools. What got conservative Christians crying persecution! was the threat of revoking the schools' tax-exempt status. America, y'all.\n\nThe lesson, going forwards, would be the power of evangelical Protestant Christianity as a political force-to motivate its believers, and the vitality of the consenting-to-legal-racism white voter as a target bloc.</p>",

But when the topic of invading their land is raised, there is reference only to the attempts of peoples like the Swedes and the Germans. These were not the first to try their hand at it. Many centuries earlier, Cyrus, Great King, King of Babylon, King of the Four Corners of the Earth, King of the Universe, also invaded the land of the Scythians, but he came to a bad end, and his expedition floundered. Then a few generations later, my lord and uncle, Darius, invaded again, marching through Thrace and across the Danube with all the peoples over which he ruled. But the Scythians - uncivilised liars all - refused to engage him in battle. They left their land desolate and retreated, again and again, until my lord Darius' supplies were depleted, and he was forced to withdraw.^1 Many were killed in the retreat, preyed upon by the mounted archers of the enemy. While Darius obviously conquered the place, since no one resisted him, it was a bit harder to enforce the demands of the Great King once the army had left their lands. This was a blemish on the otherwise glorious career of Darius, conqueror of Thrace and Naxos and Euboea and vanquisher of the rebellious cities of the Yauna that dwell by the sea.\n\n1.

                "answer": "<p>While i'm far from knowledgeable in that area, it seems that scholarship on the 1917-1919 Famine is sorely lacking. The main text appears to be *The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919* by Mohammad Gholi Majd. However, Majd's thesis has taken some hits, according to reviewer Willem Floor, Majd makes three assertions:\n\n* \u201cthe 1917-18 famine in Iran was caused by British intervention in Iran\u201d\n\n* \u201cas a result 40 percent or 9 million of the population died\u201d\n\n* \u201cthe subject of the famine and the resulting genocide has been ignored by scholars so far\u201d\n\nTo begin, Majd goes to great lengths to pick and choose his sources, ignoring sources within the British archives and over-relying on US sources, and those British sources he does use (the diaries of the British generals whom he blames the famine on) work against his theory that the British government acted to exacerbate the famine. It seems far more likely that the famine was caused by a combination of Russo-Turkish fighting and foraging in Iran, poor harvests, and bad weather conditions in the grain producing regions of Persia. Additionally, in rural areas, the famine was aggravated by the presence of those hoarding grain whose effect was minimized in places such as Tehran when local authorities took control of the food supply and dispersed it as necessary. \n\nOn the second point, Majd\u2019s choice of 9 million is likely inaccurate as he picks and chooses his census data, ignoring more accurate numbers taken from demographer Bharier:\n\n> \u201cThe author rejects the population figures for 1914 as calculated by Bharier using the backward regressive analysis, which is a standard demographic tool. Majd does not explain why he faults the methodology and assumptions used by Bharier. He only states that Bharier failed to mention the occurrence of the famine and therefore his data are wrong. Moreover, the US consul stated that in 1914 the population of Iran was 20 million, a figure that is credible given that the number of votes in the Tehran elections also shows that the population of Tehran was in the order of 400,000. Majd does not cite or discuss any other estimates by contemporaries that offer much lower, and in my estimation, more realistic figures. In 1919, the population of Tehran was 200,000 and the population of Iran as a whole was 11 million, according to Bharier. Ergo, a genocide of 9 million people. Majd does not explain why he has confidence in Bharier's 1919 population figure (p. 52) but not in his 1914 figure\u201d\n\nThe *Cambridge History of Iran Vol. 7* agree with Bharier\u2019s numbers and Dr. Mahmood Messkoub writes in *Social Policy in Iran in the Twentieth Century* \"Majd claims that the famine of 1917-1919 killed half the population, an exaggeration surely that does not tally well with the evidence provided in his otherwise useful overview of famine in that period.\"\n\nFloor tentatively agrees with Majd\u2019s third point stating:  \u201cIt is true that so far few historians have dealt with the 1917-18 famine, and after having read this book I think there is a real need that somebody does. Majd's objective is not to understand why the famine happened and why its impact was so devastating... for he only wants to show Albion's perfidy and assign blame. \u201c\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Avery, P. *Cambridge History of Iran Vol. 7* p. 609 Footnote 8.\n\n* Floor, Willem. *Review of: The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919* by Mohammad Gholi Majd.

                "answer": "<p>So, I was curious because this was high on my front page and there were no answers, so I did a quick search. I found a paper discussing the effects that the 1918 flu pandemic had on Iran, and it included some background about the effect of WWI on the Iranian populace as well. A lot of this post is taken directly from this article, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased. (The citation is : Amir Afkhami. \"Compromised Constitutions: The Iranian Experience with the 1918 Influenza Pandemic.\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 77, no. 2 (2003): 367-392. https://muse.jhu.edu/)\n\nSo Iran declared its neutrality during WWI, but despite this the great powers used Iran as a battlefield at times. Russia and Britain both had imperialist designs on Iran for various reasons, interfering with its internal politics to try and secure their own interests, and as a result it became a target during the war. Some of the incidents during the war include: the Ottomans chasing the Russians into northwestern Azerbaijan in 1914; In 1915 Wilhelm Wassmuss organized a revolt among the Qashghai tribesman in southern Iran against the British who controlled oilfields in the area; The Russians counterattacked the Ottomans allowing the British to recover control of Southern Iran by 1916; A revolutionary Iranian group called the Jangalis emerged to control the countryside of Gilan in 1917-1918; Britain also tried to use Iran as a springboard to attack Russia in an attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the new Soviet Union responded by annexing parts of northern Iran.\n\nAs a result of the warfare occurring in Iran, there was damage to Iran's economic, industrial and agricultural power. The occupying armies forcefully requisitioned or looted supplies. This led to widespread famine and the spread of disease. Iran's government was also essentially a protectorate surviving at the whims of whichever power was present and winning at the time, leaving them with little ability to actually help their own people. In addition, Ahmad Shah Qajar, the ruler of Iran at the time, was a weak ruler with little influence in his own government. The populace resented his father for authoritarian policies, and in an attempt to address this, Ahmad Shah tried to appoint only the best ministers, but he was unable to control their actions. In the face of the great powers of WWI using their country as a battlefield, and the threat of the Soviet Invasion and their humiliating demands, the populace resented the government's weakness, contributing to the political instability.\n\nWhile political instability and warfare can lead to famines, the biggest cause is often climatic. 1916 and 1917 were both years with very dry summers, leading to crop failures. This, coupled with the foreign armies seizing what food they could, resulted in widespread famine, which was worsened by hoarders and speculators. When the influenza pandemic broke out in the spring of 1918, grain supplies had hit a low point, prices had doubled from six months before, (which had reached a ten-year peak). In addition, there were outbreaks of bubonic plague, cholera, malaria and typhus. The British were also building up for their attack on the Soviet Union, and sponsoring a native military contingent known as the \"South Persia Rifles\", making long-term contracts with large landowners for grain to feed the troops, adding to the scarcity.\n\nF.A.C. Forbes-Leith describes the situation in what I assume is a memoir, Checkmate: Fighting Tradition in Central Persia. (I haven't read the actual book and am using a citation from Afkhami's article).\n\n>\"The country was in a terrible state and the peasantry was in the last stages of starvation. Every time I was forced to stop my car, I was surrounded by hundreds of near-skeletons who screamed and fought for such scraps as I was able to spare. In a single day's journey of fifty-six miles between the towns of Kirind and Kermanshah, I counted twenty-seven corpses by the roadside, most of them those of women and children, and the general condition of life amongst the peasants was so frightful that I was ashamed to eat my simple rations in their presence.\"\n\nSo the Iranian famine of 1917-1918 was primarily a man-made catastrophe exacerbated by climatic conditions in which there was also an influx of infectious diseases. The wikipedia listing states that Majd's initial population estimate of 19 million is called into question with other estimates only being 11 million. Afkhami's article says that Iran's projected population at the beginning of 1918 was 11 million, so it may be that the 19 million number comes from *before* WWI broke out, and after the famine it had hit 11 million, at which point the influenza pandemic hit, killing a further 8% to 21% of the population according to Afkhami. (0.8 to 2.3 million). Although Afkhami's footnotes say that the population in 1918 was not too different from the population in 1913, before the war, which I am not sure whether to believe or not, given the effects of famine prior to the flu's arrival.</p>",

The most-cited book I found was Mohammad Gholi Majd's *The Great Famine & Genocide in Iran* (available in [preview mode on Google Books](https://books.google.be/books?id=5WgSAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)).\n\nYou can also have a look at [*Iran and Its Place Among Nations,*](https://books.google.be/books?id=PO_s9H5QTp4C&pg=PA16&dq=iran+famine+1917&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUlrC_7oXOAhUGXRoKHVbqDXYQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&q=iran%20famine%201917&f=false) which provides a summary of Majd's argument.\n>One of the little known calamities of World War I and its aftermath in Iran is the widespread famine that the war engendered across the country. The most significant treatment of this subject is the book by the agricultural economist Mohammed-Gholi Majd, *The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919.* [...] Majid quotes the American charge d'affaires in Persia at the time, Wallace Smith Muray, as having claimed that in 1917-1918, up to one-third of Iran's population was wiped out by famine and disease. \n\n>To be sure, the exact causes of the devastating famine are difficult to grasp. Majd blames the British who, after the Russian revolution of 1917, had become the main foreign power in Iran. Having isolated farmers from their customers inside Iran the British, Majd claims, made it impossible for the country's fertile regions in its north and northwest to remain connected to the rest of the country. At the same time, according to Majd, a significant amount of the grains produced in Iran were forcibly acquired for British troops in the country and shipped abroad to other British troops in the region.\n\n>Majd concludes that, unbeknownst to most, one of the main genocides of the twentieth century occured in Iran during and immediately after World War I.\n\nHowever, the authors also point out:\n\n>It is difficult for rigorous academic research to corroborate these figures. The word \"genocide\" implies the willful killing of large numbers of noncombatants. The historical record in this area is murky. A more extensive scholarly treatment of this subject would have to utilize \"triangulation\" and provide evidence from others, including British, Russian, and Ottoman sources, to show the extent of the famine and the ways in which it was affected by the war and its aftermath. \n\nAnd, if you have access to JSTOR, you can also find [another review of Majd's argument by Persia scholar Willem Floor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4311715?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). He is very critical of Majd - going as far as sarcasm:\n\n>So good were the British in concealing that there even had been a famine that the document tabled by the official Persian delegation to the Versailles peace treaty trivialized the famine and obscured its causes [...] The scheme worked so well that scholars dealing with Iran, even if they did know about, did not write about it, until now. \n\nThe thrust of Floor's argument is that Majd's estimate of the Iranian population is far too high and that he has it out against the British. He suggests reading James Barton's *Story of Near East Relief 1915-1930* for a overview of the difficulties of famine-relief in the broader region.\n\nBarton points to light snowfall in the winter, spring drought and the breakdown of the irrigation system as partially responsible for famine in Iran's Kermanshah and Hamadan provinces. \n\nSo, as you can see, there's some debate around this famine. I'm surprised there is no Wikipedia article about it.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The first week wasn't especially important but it was part of a very short arc that saw Hitler go from opposition political leader to absolute dictator in a series of steps. \n\nThe Depression in Germany splintered public opinion. This led to a very unstable legislature in where no one party could govern effectively. As a result, there was an increasing reliance on government by emergency decree by otherwise mainstream parties. This established norms for authoritarianism and anti-democratic behaviour but had little to do with the Nazis. They were just a growing opposition party at this point, seen as outside realistic voting options for most. \n\nHitler announced he would only seek power through elections in 1931, which helped solidify him as a viable political choice for the middle class, capitalists, military officers and other conservatives. Before that, Hitler and the Nazis were seen as ruffians outside the pale of good taste that appealed to angry violent yahoos. \n\nHitler came a strong second in the January 1932 Presidential election to Hindenburg, and remained leader of a large but not in any way dominant political party. The Nazis were one of numerous parties in a highly fractured legislature. More parliamentary elections were held in July and November of 1932 but there was no ability to form a majority government that was stable, and the minority administrations were rudderless. \n\nAfter the November elections, a number of leading politicians and wealthy men appealed to President Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor in order to get stability. In January 1933, he came to power in a coalition with just three positions for the Nazis but critically, control of the police. \n\nThat first week wasn't especially profound. But Hitler quickly dissolved the legislature and called for new elections to be held in early March. I'm not sure if that was in the first week or not, but the calling of the elections wasn't especially crucial. \n\nFeburary 27, 1933 was crucial: The Reichstag building was set on fire. A Communist was found inside in incriminating circumstances, accused of the crime by the Nazi policing minister and the resulting political crisis gave Hitler the excuse to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree. He suspended basic rights and allowed arrest without trial. Mass arrests of communists and political opponents were combined with political violence and intense anti-communist propaganda. \n\nThere is a near consensus that the fire was the work of that communist. There is a minority view that the Nazis had a role in setting the fire and framed the communists to give them the excuse to issue the decree and polarize the election against the communists. Either way, the fire gave Hitler the excuse to issue the decree and that was act that got him a dictatorship. \n\nThe Nazis came short of a majority in the election. To remedy this, they proposed legislation giving Hitler a 4 year temporary dictatorship. This required a super majority in the House, and they didn't have the votes. So the Nazis used the Reichstag Fire Decree powers and their control of the police to arrest the communist members of the legislature. They also detained some of the Social Democrats and physically intimidated others. They created so much chaos and intimidation, and took away so many opposition votes, that they made their bill viable. \n\nOn March 23, 1933, the Reichstag voted to grant Hitler those \"temporary\" powers to enact laws without the consent of the legislature. From here they expanded their campaign to outlawing the Social Democrats as well as the Communists, then dissolved all trade unions. Political opponents were sent to the concentration camps. By June, all other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. \n\nThe first week in power wasn't that important. But democracy was completely dissolved within five months of Hitler assuming office and Germany turned into a one-party state that jailed and murdered opponents. \n\nSources: Shirer, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.

                "answer": "<p>Eddie, I'd contend that what you should be paying attention to is an event that happened less than one month after Hitler was appointed chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933. I'm referring, of course, to [the Reichstag fire](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007657).\n\nOn Feb. 27, 1933, the German parliament building, the Reichstag, burned down. \n\nThis is a key moment in the rise of Nazi Germany and one of the points at which Germany shifts from the Weimar Republic to a totalitarian state.\n\nThe Reichstag had been the heart of democratic Germany, a representative body that \u2500 even in 1933 \u2500 still held the belief that it answered to the people, not the state. The Nazi party held a minority of seats in that body. It had even lost 34 seats in the November 1932 election while the Communist Party gained 11 (for a total of 100). \n\nThe Reichstag was by no means perfect. The Weimar government had shown its flaws, and the rise of Nazism had shown the Reichstag's conservative members to be willing to go along with the radical Nazis. The conservatives in the Reichstag believed Hitler was a buffoon, someone controllable even if he got into power as chancellor. They were not captivated by his speeches (in general) and believed he was less extreme than he actually was. With Hindenburg as president, the conservatives believed that Hitler would be checked, and the Nazis could be brought into the fold safely. Things worked out differently, of course.\n\nWhen the fire took place, Hitler and his closest advisers saw that it was a golden opportunity. A young Dutch Communist had been arrested at the scene, and so they were quick to declare the fire an arson, a communist plot designed, as Goebbels wrote in his diary, \"to sow confusion in order, in the general panic, to grasp power for themselves.\"\n\nMany people have claimed in the years since the fire that it was entirely orchestrated by the Nazis as a pretext to seize power. Many others have claimed that there's little evidence of a conspiracy, and that the Nazi leadership was simply opportunistic. [Richard Evans' 2014 review of *Burning the Reichstag* is a wonderfully detailed breakdown of the arguments](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n09/richard-j-evans/the-conspiracists). \n\nIn the end, I'm not sure whether it matters all that much. In either case, the Nazis called the fire an act of terrorism, and in order to fight terrorism, they needed to improve security. In order to improve security, they needed new powers for the state, and they needed to make arrests. Nazi party members were enrolled as auxiliary policemen, and overnight they arrested hundreds \u2500 if not thousands \u2500 of communists and left-wing politicians and political organizers. Disregarding parliamentary immunity, the Nazis seized the leaders of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party.\n\nThe morning after the fire, the German cabinet \u2500 which, like the Reichstag, had a non-Nazi majority \u2500 drew up an emergency decree designed to ensure security. It abolished freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, legalized phone-tapping, suspended the freedom of some of the German states, and in general meant the end of free government in Germany.\n\nUsing the terrorist attack at the Reichstag as a pretext, the Nazis pushed through the emergency decree, which was signed by a wavering Hindenburg. \n\nNow, with unprecedented power as Chancellor, Hitler was able to brow-beat his opponents. Less than a week after the emergency decree passed and the Nazis had been able to unleash a firestorm of violence against their opponents, a new federal election was held. The Nazis still tallied only 44 percent of the vote, despite their actions, but it was enough.\n\nTwo weeks after the election, the Nazis were able to gain enough votes from non-socialists to pass the Enabling Acts. These acts gave Hitler and his ministers exclusive legislative power. The president and the Reichstag were sidelined.\n\nBy the summer of 1933, all opposition was crushed. More than 100,000 people had been sent to concentration camps. Thousands more were murdered. All independent political parties were dissolved. Only the Nazis remained.\n\nIt happened that quickly. There were less than four months between Germany's last free elections, in November 1932, and the passage of the Enabling Acts in March 1933. If you want to learn more about this, read Richard Evans' *The Coming of the Third Reich.* It's widely published and easy to understand.\n\n***\n\nNow that I've told you what I think, let me actually answer your question.\n\nOn the night that Hitler became Reich Chancellor, Goebbels organized a torchlight parade in Berlin with some 60,000 participants. Some observers noted in their journals that Goebbels had the marchers go in a circle, so as to pass the reviewing stand at least twice in order to create the impression of greater numbers. There were still plenty of cheers regardless.\n\nThough the Nazis put on a show of force with the parade and other events, they were careful to stage the production as a show of support for Hindenburg, to say that the parades were a \"tribute to Hindenburg\" and that they were not truly disrupting the traditional order. There were marches in other cities as well, and occasional violent clashes with Communists. There was a shootout in Spandau, shots fired from a house in Charlottenburg at a march. Copies of the communist party newspaper were seized and burned.\n\nGenerally, however, the leftist parties and left-center parties tried to keep a low profile, fearing a government crackdown on their operations. There was local opposition, but nothing organized at a national level.\n\nFour days after taking the Chancellorship, Hitler made moves to keep the leadership of the German Army neutral. He feared a coup, and to reduce the chance of that, he spoke to Army leaders and pledged to do many of the things they favored \u2500 fight the Treaty of Versailles, restore conscription, and destroy Marxism.\n\nOn Feb. 4, the cabinet issued a decree allowing the government to detain for up to three months (without trial) people who used weapons to breach the peace. It was targeted at people resisting Nazi stormtroopers. \n\nBefore Hitler became Chancellor, the Prussian police had been keeping an eye on Nazis and other paramilitaries who caused trouble. The police might not have been able to act against these armed groups because of political considerations, but they still investigated them. Hitler ordered those investigations to stop.\n\nIn the middle of February, Hitler also created an auxiliary police force made up of Nazi paramilitaries, in effect putting Nazi violence under the protection of the police.\n\nIn the beginning of February, the Nazi minister of the Interior, Wilhelm Frick, and Hermann Goring (the minister of the Interior for Prussia) began banning Social Democratic newspapers. The Social Democrats responded by suing, which had some success.\n\nAs the month went on, the Social Democrats began to join the Communists as targets of violence from Nazi paramilitaries. In response, the Social Democrats tried to stick to a legalistic defense. They did not want to respond to Nazi violence with violence of their own, an act that would encourage a heavy-handed response from the federal government.\n\nIn Wurttemberg State, the president, Eugen Bolz, declared the new government to be an enemy of freedom. Hitler responded that Bolz had no room to talk, since he hadn't protected the Nazi Party when it was persecuted in the 1920s.\n\n\"Those who made no mention of our freedom for 14 years have no right to talk about it today. As Chancellor I need only use one law for the protection of the national state, just as they made a law for the protection of the Republic back then, and then they would realize that not everything they called freedom was worthy of the name,\" Hitler said in a speech.\n\nWhile the Nazi paramilitaries were making enemies of the Social Democrats and the Communists (and to a lesser extent, the Centre Party), there were plenty of people in Germany who delighted in what he was doing. Remember, this was the Great Depression, and there were many in Germany who enjoyed his actions.\n\nEvans quotes the diary of a woman named Louise Solmitz:\n\n\"I\u2019m delighted at Hitler\u2019s lack of a programme, for a programme is either lies, weakness, or designed to catch silly birds. \u2500 The strongman acts from the necessity of a serious situation and can\u2019t allow himself to be bound.\"\n\n</p>",

Speculation claims that Puffy paid for this, as he wanted to use the chain in a Bad Boy video mocking DR, but if there's evidence that it was more than speculation, I've never seen it. \n\nAdditionally, it's fairly well documented that in the weeks following 2Pac's death there was a large scale gang war in LA, seeking retaliation for his death. MC Eiht, a longtime Compton rapper, has [gone on record] (http://www.ballerstatus.com/2016/02/03/mc-eiht-says-tupacs-gang-affiliations-led-to-his-death/) stating he believes it was 2Pac's gang affiliation (through Suge Knight) that led to his murder. \n\nIf you comb through his Death Row releases, they're full of references to Bloods, down to his repeated use of \"M.O.B.,\" a common Blood saying (Suge is also a known member of the Mob Pirus) and shout-outs to known Pirus ([Neckbone, Tray,Buntry](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-philipssuge15nov1502-story.html)).\n\nThat said, LAPD Detective Greg Kading wrote in his book [Murder Rap](https://www.amazon.com/Murder-Rap-Untold-Investigations-Detective/dp/0983955484) that he believes Puffy commissioned Keffe D for the hit. It is also alleged that Biggie [paid $1 million and provided the gun] (http://www.mtv.com/news/1457346/biggie-paid-gang-to-kill-tupac-report-says/) that took out his rival. \n\nThere is further speculation that 2Pac was planning on leaving Death Row, which led to Suge Knight to order his death, but remember Knight was in the car when 2Pac was shot. \n\nAt the end of the day, no one really knows.

                "answer": "<p>Ok, so as far as I can tell the vote was anonymous, thus the problem is that we might never know who did not vote for Hitler in that meeting.\n\nWhen reviewing the fragmentary early membership lists of the NSDAP, there are a few possibilities who could have voted against Hitler but the most likely is Anton Drexler.\n\nDrexler was one of the  founders of the NSDAP (then named Deutsche Arbeiter Partei, German Workers' Party, DAP) in 1919 and Hitler's main rival for party chairman in 1921. Drexler who had been the second chair of the party had taken over first chair in 1920 when his predecessor Karl Harrer resigned over conflicts with Hitler. A similar fate awaited Drexler, who was unable to mount any serious resistance to Hitler. Hitler had parctically become indispensable for the party by 1921 because of his success as an orator and he guarded that role as well as what he understood as ideological purity of the movement jealously.\n\nIn 1920 and 21 the NSDAP was plagued by a shortage of money and by being one among the many v\u00f6lkisch movements in Germany. To alleviate both of these problems, they attempted to merge with other, similar, parties such as the DSP and the Deutsche Werksgemeinschaft. Hitler opposed this because it threatened his supremacy in the party, so he used his own role as leverage. Successfully crashing the DSP negotiations, he attempted the same in connection with the DWG negations but failed and so, in a fit of rage, he threatened to resign several times in 1920 and 1921. Every time, fearing the loss of their popular orator and really, the only thing that set them apart form the dime a dozen v\u00f6lisch parties in Germany, the NSDAP leadership placated Hitler by giving him what he wanted.\n\nAgain sent to to convince Hitler not to resign, Drexler asked him in July 1921 what he wanted. Hitler demanded chairmanship and extraordinary powers within the party. While Drexler and Hitler showed their unity on July 1926, Drexler as the current chairman was obviously the choice for those who opposed Hitler within the party and there seem to have been at least some because according to Ian Kershaw, 3000 anonymous pamphlets attacking Hitler had been prepared by the time, the members' meeting rolled around.\n\nSo, it might have been Drexler who voted against Hitler, possibly expecting a victory of himself, which obviously didn't pan out. Drexler left the NSDAP when it was dissolved after the Hitler Putsch and only rejoined in 1933 never again to gain any kind of political role until his death in 1942.\n\nOther possibilities include Gottfired Feder, prominent member of the anti-Capitalist movement within the NSDAP, who later served in minor roles in the Nazi adminsitration; the first chairman, Harrer, though it is unknown if he was even there (he died of natural causes in 1926); or one of the lesser known early members about whom little information can be found such as Hans Baumann or Karl Beggel; or it could have been Hitler himself following convention in some parties of abstaining to vote for himself though given his personality that seems rather unlikely. In the end, it probably is not possible to find out with any kind of certainty.\n\nEdit: Apparently, Robert Payne claims that the dissenting vote came from a man called Rudolf Posch, a party member and librarian (who is not to be confused with the Austrian Social Democrat of the same name). I have no idea where this claim comes from. Neither Payne nor Joseph Howard Tyson who also mentions this in his book on Dietrich Eckhart have that fact footnoted, though it is likely that one of them got that fact from the other. I could go and look up his Nazi party file though according to the information in the search engine of the German Bundesarchiv it is rather thin and it seems that man never made any sort of impact on the history of the NSDAP again and what became of him is unknown.\n\n2nd edit: for more on the conflict between Hitler and others in the party see /u/boffcheese comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5bs2hk/hitler_won_control_of_the_nazi_party_with_an/d9r1se1/)\n\nSources:\n\n* Ian Kershaw: Hitler.\n\n* Wolfgang Horn: Der Marsch zur Machtergreifung.

                "answer": "<p>Tolkien was a medievalist, so not surprisingly, he drew heavily from period primary sources. These, in turn, drew on actual folk traditions, although one must use a great deal of caution to see them as accurately capturing contemporary folklore. \n\nOne of the more important deviations that Tolkien imposed on the world of his creation was the idea of good and evil, which was largely absent from Northern European folk tradition. The dichotomy was a Church-based importation, and the folk were not quick to embrace it. Tolkien, perhaps because he was a committed Catholic but perhaps also for the facility of his concept of plot and literature, embraced the good-versus-evil approach to his world, and this required some \"tweaking\" of the legendary traditions that served as his inspiration.\n\nAlthough Icelandic sources include an odd reference to light and dark elves, there is no clear manifestation of such a concept in pre-modern Scandinavian, Icelandic, or British and Irish tradition. Nevertheless, Tolkien - drawing on this or simply setting off on his own - created a dichotomy where his elves were good and their counterpart, the orcs, played the role that one might imagine could have been assumed by \"dark elves.\" In reality, folk traditions regarded all supernatural beings a dangerous even though most were neither good nor evil. They were to be treated with caution and respect, and they were to be avoided if at all possible.\n\nTolkien's dwarves are more at home in medieval primary literature than they are in pre-modern folk tradition. There are entities that seem to fall into that line (living within mountains, focusing on smithing, and various other attributes), but with dwarves we see the clearest, exclusive use of medieval sources.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As outlined in Geoffrey Robertson's book *An Inconvenient Genocide*, the core belief behind the Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide lies in the *motives* for the killings. Turkish Officials don't deny that Ottoman military personnel killed Armenians; they dispute the amount (they claim 300 000, while the most commonly referred to number is 1.5 million) and the reasoning behind it.\n\nRobertson cites the Turkish \"official\" numbers of Armenians living in Turkey at the time as a reason that 1.5 million Armenians couldn't have been killed: \"[Turkish] demographic studies prove that prior to World War I, fewer than 1.5 million Armenians lived in the entire Ottoman Empire. Thus, allegations that more than 1.5 million Armenians from eastern Anatolia died must be false.\"\n\n(It's noteworthy that Robertson counters this with evidence from the Armenian Church, who claim that 2.1 million Armenians were living in Anatolia at that time.)\n\nOn the intention, Article II of the United Nations *Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Genocide* outlines that, in order for a sanctioned killing to be classified as a genocide, there must be \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group...\". Turkish officials today claim that the killings were performed because Armenians \"rose up\" against the Ottoman government in support of Russia, hoping that in victory they would claim their independence. To support this, in 2007 Turkish counsellor Orhan Tung wrote in the New Statesman (an opinion that the government mirrors to this day) that \"credible evidence\" for the intention to commit genocide has never been concretely found. This is obviously disputed, because as opposed to the Holocaust or the Bosnian War, there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.\n\n(Again, its worth noting that Armenian historian Ara Sarafian reported to Mediamax that *Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide*, which was published by the Gomidas Institute in April 2011, as a proper Ottoman government document showcasing this exact intent.)\n\ntl;dr: The Turkish government doesn't belief that an Armenian *genocide* happened, but refer to it as politically motivated killings, because of the definition of \"genocide\" by the United Nations.\n\n</p>",

You assume that current Turkish state does not see itself as the continuation of Ottoman Empire, but it does. I think an easier question to answer would be \"why and how Turkey denies the Armenian genocide\". \n\nThere are different levels of genocide denial in Turkey, I will explain some of them and source them.\n\n1st level: \"There was no killings, therefore there was no genocide.\" This is NOT the most popular version of the denial in Turkey. Most Turks accept that there were killings. Defenders of this version are commonly the Neo-Ottomanists in Turkey. Their argument is that Armenians were called as \"sadik millet\" or \"millet-i sadika\" (\"loyal nation\") in the empire, then they betrayed Ottomans and sided with Russians. Started gangs and mass killed Turkish people and Ottomans had to exile them. This version of history totally dismisses all the evidence of mass killings, by using conspiracy theories. As an example of this theory you can look at an example, which defends that Armenian genocide was invented to slander Ottoman empire:\n\nErmeni Sorunu: B\u00fcy\u00fck Oyun (Armenian Problem: Grand Game) by Adem Suad\n\n2nd level: According to this, there were mass killings on both sides, but this was not a genocide. This is by far the most commonly believed version in Turkey. They mix truth with conspiracy theories and say that accepting genocide will have serious consequences for Turkey so we should not do that. They describe Ottoman Empire at the time as weak, they say that as the empire could not protect its citizens, it had to use force against Armenians. As Armenian gangs terrorized Turkish villages, Turkish people started arming themselves and attacked Armenians for revenge and Ottoman Empire could not stop them. \n\nThere are many different versions but they are all around denying responsibility in some manner. They say that for it to be counted as genocide, it has to be systematic, government has to round up all Armenians and kill all of them. As Ottoman Empire exiled the Armenians and some of them died on the road due to climate, starving etc. it is not a genocide. Founder of Turkey Mustafa Kemal Ataturk himself described the events by using the word \"fecaat\" (\"disaster\"). But he would not see it as a genocide as well. The defenders of this theory overlook events where government killed people just because they were Armenians as particular mistakes. They say that \"there is no written general plans of genocide\".\n\nSome examples of Turkish historians, politicians and generals defending this theory:\n\nS\u00fcrg\u00fcnden Soyk\u0131r\u0131ma: Ermeni \u0130ddalar\u0131 (\"From Exile to Genocide: Armenian Claims) by Yusuf Hala\u00e7o\u011flu (historian)\n\nErmeni Su\u00e7lamalar\u0131 ve Ger\u00e7ekler (\"Armenian Accusations and Truths\") by \u0130lker Ba\u015fbu\u011f (ex army chief of Turkey)\n\nErmeni Sorununda Strateji ve Siyaset (Strategy and Politics in Armenian Problem) by Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek (far-right politician)\n\n3rd level: It was a genocide, but it was committed by the Kurds. This is a last resort defense and has some truth to it, but again only partly. Ottoman Empire armed Muslim Kurds against Christians during 1890-1908, they are named as Hamidiye corps. After 1908, Ottoman Empire continued to support Kurdish a\u015firets (tribes? clans?) against Christians, especially Armenians. So some people claim that genocide happened, but it was the Kurds. Again, dismissing how Armenians in other parts of the empire were killed as well.\n\nSource:\n\nHamidiye Alaylar\u0131 A\u011fr\u0131 K\u00fcrt Direni\u015fi Ve Zilan Katliam\u0131 (\"Hamidiye Corps, Agri Kurdish Resistance and Zilan Massacre\") by Kemal S\u00fcphanda\u011f.\n\n\nAll of these are very controversial. Especially in Turkey. But I hope I gave you some idea at least. Sorry if I made mistakes, English is not my native language.\n\nEdit: There are also many other versions that I did not list. For example some people claim that it was the will of Germany and not the Ottoman Empire.

                "answer": "<p>I hope one of our trusted contributors on Finland will show up and go into further detail, especially concerning the debates in Finland this discovery caused but as far as the history of the EK Finland goes, here's what Oula Silvennoinen, the PhD student, discovered:\n\nSilvennoinen shows that the Finnish secret police Valtiollinen Poliisi (Valpo) worked in close cooperation with the German Reich Security Main Office and its predecessor organizations. While he describes several phases of cooperation, in general, the two organizations worked closely together. This was due not only through personal connections such as those of Wenrer Best and Heinrich M\u00fcller of Gestapo fame and the second in command of Valpo, Bruno Aaltonen, but also due to ideological affinities. What unite Valpo and the Nazis was anti-Communism.\n\nThe anti-communist bend of Valpo contributed according to Silvennoinen majorly to the close cooperation of Valpo and the RSHA, especially in the interrogation, selection, and execution of Soviet POWs in Finnish POW camps. Silvennoinen explains that Finland and with it, Valpo, had due to their own experience first with attempted communist revolution after WWI and after that with Soviet designs on expansion and the declaration of the Winter War, slid more and more towards, what he terms \"anti-Communist democracy\". Valpo was especially affected due to its institutional nature as a secret police engaged in fighting communist and agitators. Due to this ideological affinity Valpo also started more and more to warm towards Nazi anti-Semitism, which saw Jews as responsible for Bolshevism and thus participate in anti-Semitic campaigns of the Nazis.\n\nSilvennoinen's main point concerning Valpo is that at some point the institution started to operate, especially in its collaboration with the RSHA, with only minimal or no knowledge of the democratic government as far as can be told, though he makes the point that further studies would be necessary to illuminate this particular point. Over all however, he draws a picture of a democratic state collborating with the Nazis not because of occupation but because of geopolitical and security political considerations.\n\nConcerning the EK Finland, he shows that the unit, founded in Summer 1941 and dissolved in autumn 1942, did indeed participate in Nazi crimes by selecting up to 3000 people who had been captured by Finnish forces during the continuation war and kept in Finnish POW camps top be shot by the Nazis. He not only shows that \"Jew\" was a specific category for selection but also that the EK Finland did in fact participate in anti-Partisan operations of the Germans, meaning that they were involved in the killing of civilians and Jews, in the Northern Soviet Union.\n\n[The project during the course of which Silvennoinen researched his dissertation](http://www.arkisto.fi/uploads/Palvelut/Julkaisut/POW%20deaths_web.pdf) shows that although Finnish courts did indeed sentence people responsible for the unlawful killing of Soviet POWs, EK Finland did not play a role during these proceedings, which deaths with only 56 cases of unlawful deaths of POWs \u2013 a number he terms to be too small.\n\nSilvennoinen's contribution to this volume is especially fascinating since it deals with another of Valpo's tasks: Handing over civilians to the German authorities for either deportation or killing, including political adversaries of Nazi Germany who had fled to Finland. Though this concerned \"only\" 135 cases it still is a chapter in Finish history that has been neglected so far and where one of the most important factors was that this happened in accordance with existing legislation.\n\nBasically, this gives a quick summary of Silvennoinen's points as far as I am familiar with them. His thesis has been published in German but not in English as far as I am aware. I really hope someone might illuminate further on the discussions that arose from his findings within Finnish public discourse.\n\nEdit: I also highly recommend [this article](https://www.google.de/search?q=finland+and+the+holocaust+reassesment&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab&gfe_rd=cr&ei=uLKPWMHVB96E1gL51KaQBQ) going into further detail.

                "answer": "<p>The Einsatzkommando that operated in Finland during the \"Continuation War\", as the Finnish component of their involvement is known, was was created as part of the German POW administration. The sources that survive detailing their activities are, unfortunately, scant, which helps explain why their role was so forgotten, but Oula Silvennoinen's work is well regarded, as far as I have read.\n\nA major underpinning of the work, and more importantly, the cooperation of Finnish authorities, came from an agreement made in the fall of 1941 wherein the Finns would turn over ethnic German POWs captured fighting with the Soviets, and in turn the Germans would turn over ethnic Finns. Once turned over to German custody, the Einsatzkommando would interrogate them, and separate them out based on racial and political criteria. Those deemed trustworthy and racially acceptable were sent on their way, while those with some \"defect\" or other were held further. In total, 521 prisoners were handed over categorized as political officers or Communists, of which 47 were Jewish. Unfortunately records do not exist for just how many of them were eventually killed by the Einsatzkommando, but eyewitness testimony puts the numbers in the hundreds.\n\nNow, to be sure, the Finns were not in the dark about the possible fate of those prisoners being turned over to German custody. Again there is a paucity of evidence as the Finns certainly tried to keep such matters quiet both during and after the war, but it is not completely gone. In one particularly damning statement, Colonel Sulo Malm, who was in charge of Finnish POW arrangements, had mentioned to the military attach\u00e9 in Stockholm of \u201cthe handing over of Russian politruks and [political] commissars to the Germans in Salla, where they were killed by the Germans.\"\n\nNow, as for how these revelations played out once published in 2008, well... it had little impact in Finland, where it seems most people preferred to ignore it and not let the new evidence cloud the general view of Finnish participation in the war - \"co-belligerents, not allies!\" as I many a Finn would likely make sure to stress. Although it predates the revelations, this excerpt from President Tarja Halonen's 2005 address is a fair illustration of the view that I reference:\n\n>In late summer 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union agreed on a division of Europe into spheres of influence. The following winter Finland had to fight off an attack by the Red Army in order to preserve her independence and avoid being occupied by the Soviet Union. We had to do this alone, without significant outside help. Five years later, in the summer of 1944, we again managed to stop the Red Army\u2019s attempts to conquer Finland. Our country was not occupied at any stage, during or a er the war. We lost part of our territory, but we achieved a defensive victory.\n\nWith the Finnish academic community, certainly, it had some impact, and helped to solidify the view that most Finnish historians hold which runs counter to the \"neo-patriotic master narrative of war\" seen above, but calls outside the academy for reevaluation of the public consciousness of the war are few, and fall on deaf ears. But even what impact there has been hasn't always been as full-throated as one might hope. While, as noted, the publication *did* have influence with war historians, while *other* countries - at least those that even took notice - focused on the revelations of complicity in genocide - the headline in Sweden's *Dagens Nyheter* was simply \u201c**Finland participated in the Holocaust**\", *that* aspect seems to have had little play even within the academy, and instead Finnish historians prefered to concentrate on it as strong evidence against the 'separate war thesis.'\n\n-----\n\nKinnunen, Tiina, and Ville Kivima\u0308ki.

Amongst them were some Jews, but their exact number is not known. After Finns gave their prisoners to the Germans, it is presumed that they were all promptly executed.\n\nBesides Einsatzkommando Finnland there were roughly a dozen Jewish refugees seeking sanctuary in Finland who were turned over to Germans.\n\nRight now, it is speculated that the reason for transferring prisoners to Germans was most likely political pressure from Nazi command. There were Jewish soldiers, even officers, serving in the Finnish armed forces during their co-operation with Nazi Germany. Some were even awarded the Iron Cross, but all recipients refused them.\n\nSuch a sore spot demanded some compensation and, having no other choice, Finland handed over prisoners and refugees instead of their serving citizens. Some researches have stated that had they not, shipments of grain would've stopped coming from Germany, resulting in starvation in many parts of the country.\n\nIt is a shameful part of Finnish history and because of that, it has only recently resurfaced.

                "answer": "<p>Well, I think I can answer the first half of your question, though I don't know enough to answer the second half beyond the vague familiarity with questions about iconography and iconoclasm that comes with a Catholic upbringing and one year at a Jesuit university, so I think I'll leave that aside and stick to the Islamic half of your question.\n\nOk, with that being said, let's break this down into constituent parts.\n\nFirstly, I want to answer something that you didn't ask, but is good for background:\n\n1. Why was Muhammad named \"Muhammad\", what does that name mean and how do Arabic names work?\n\nWe might actually go back even further and ask an interesting side question of why Muhammad was named Muhammad. Etymologically in Arabic the name \"Muhammad\" means sort of 'one who is praised' or 'one who is praiseworthy'. In pre-Islamic Arabia it seems to have been a highly unusual name for males. My understanding is that all of the surviving examples of other men with the name Muhammad in pre-Islamic Arabia were also holy men. The female version \"Muhammada\" seems to have been much more common. This has even produced some (albeit fringe) speculation that Muhammad might have been an appellation rather than a name as such. I don't buy that, nor is it necessary to.\n\nEtymologically it's also worth noting that as Arabic is a semitic language it works on tri-letter roots, in this case H-M-D, and therefore the name Muhammad is etymologically related and similar in meaning to names like Ahmed, Hamid and Mahmoud.\n\nAlso, \"Muhammad\" would not have been Muhammad's only personal name. Arabic names can also include what is known as a Kunya. Most commonly this takes the form of \"Father of X\" with X being your oldest male child. But it can also be an epithet. The first caliph Abu Bakr's name literally means \"Father of Camel Foal,\" but it just means that he spent a lot of time riding camels and had a family that was engaged in herding. Muhammad's kunya was Abu al-Qassim, the father of Qassim, who was his son who died in early childhood.\n\nArabic names also typically include a patronymic or nasab (ibn Fulan...son of so-and-so). This can string along for as long as is necessary back to whichever ancestor is most relevant for tribal or other purposes. It can also skip generations to get to a more uniquely identifying individual. I'm less familiar with pre-Islamic naming practices but it's also worth mentioning laqabs, which today are often translated as simply surnames but in a pre-modern context could include nickname-like titles, particular for important individuals and rulers, as well as nisbas, which today are likewise often a last name but could also refer to a tribe or place of origin. \n\nI'll come back to this later (and I'm sure one of our native Arabic speakers here will correct me if I've mis-identified part of this) but to take the example of a well-known medieval religious scholar you might have a name like: **A\u1e25mad** (Ism, or name) **bin Mu\u1e25ammad** (nasab) **bin \u1e24anbal** (nasab) **Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h** (kunya, i.e. Ahmad's son is named Abdullah) **al-Shayb\u0101n\u012b** (tribal nisba, indicating descent from the [Banu Shayban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Shayban)).\n\n--------\n\nPhew, ok, with that background moving into your questions. I'll start with the easier one first:\n\n2 . Why do Muslims name their male children Muhammad?\n\nThere's potentially a very long explanation of getting into how exactly these practices developed and whether this was universally true at all times and particularly in the earliest years of Islam, but to cut a long story short, the practice of Islam is based on carrying out God's commandments. Etymologically \"Islam\" means submission to God or to God's will as delivered through the message of his Prophet, the seal of the prophets (i.e. the last and most perfect prophet), Muhammad.\n\nIn Islam, the Qur'an is the perfect record of God's speech and revelation to mankind. But very early, in all likelihood during Muhammad's lifetime, it became assumed or presumed that in the absence of a Qur'anic message or commandment, it is best to follow the example of the Prophet in all things, down to the most minute details. Together the collected records of this side of Muhammad's personal life is known as the \"sunna\" and is recorded in the Hadith, and gives its name to \"Sunni\" Islam. NB that Shia Muslims also follow the prophetic example but also believe in following the examples of Ali and his descendants (who are also Muhammad's descendants, as he married Muhammad's daughter, and was incidentally his ~~nephew~~ [edit: h/t /u/asoomdeys ] cousin to begin with).\n\nIn any event, included among these hadith are statements by Muhammad suggesting that Muslims name themselves and their children after himself: https://sunnah.com/search/?q=use+my+name\n\n\"Name yourself...?\" you may be asking. Well, one of the traditions in Islam is to take on an Islamic/Arabic name when you convert. It's not 100% guaranteed universal, but was very common.\n\nAlso note that Muhammad forbade the use of his Kunya, Abu al-Qassim. Like all religious strictures of course, this one has been broken historically: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Qasim\n\n3 . Why is it that Muslims are opposed to the depiction of Muhammad?\n\nThis is slightly more complicated, at least historically or when discussing historical practices. The contemporary sort of Salafist or ultra-orthodox answer is very simple, which is that images of human beings generally are potentially idolatrous. In practice this can be somewhat bi-polar: the Arab Persian Gulf states plaster the faces of their rulers on practically every building, but only put gazelles and coffee-pots on their coinage.\n\nIn any event, the concern with images of Muhammad in particular is multifaceted. There is concern that the image of Muhammad is perhaps uniquely susceptible to idolatry and he must therefore, in particular not be depicted. Insofar as it is taken as being commanded against in the religion, depictions of Muhammad are therefore also ipso facto blasphemy. And lastly there is concern that in the case of cartoons or depictions of Muhammad drawn by non-Muslims that these are an assault on the honor of Muhammad (who, as we've discussed, is basically regarded as a perfect human being) and on the religion of Islam itself. It's therefore an incredibly emotive issue.\n\nThe more complicated answer would be how that came to be and whether it was always so as /u/FlamingBlankets and /u/Newtothisredditbiz allude to. This is a historiographically complex and deeply debated question, which to my knowledge largely focuses on two distinct periods in Islamic history.\n\nThe first is earliest Islamic period. Representational art was not really a feature of pre-Islamic Arabic culture. After the conquest period Muslims apparently adopted representational art quite readily. So you have the frescoes in the [Umayyad desert palaces](https://www.google.ae/search?q=frescoes+umayyad&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQsqSEw8HQAhUKrY8KHXcKCd4Q_AUICCgB&biw=1680&bih=871) or the so-called \"standing caliph\" coins: https://www.google.ae/search?q=standing+caliph+coins&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwil7bCcw8HQAhUKKY8KHQ0EAWYQ_AUICCgB&biw=1680&bih=871\n\nThere are lots of questions about this. Were these simply accommodation to pre-existing Greco-Roman and Zoroastrian culture? After all, these coins were clearly modeled on existing Byzantine coinage. Or did something about the depiction of humans in Islamic ideology change fundamentally under Abd al-Malik in the late 7th/early 8th century such that he adopted (or perhaps invented?) the more distinctly \"Islamic\" coinage style: https://attwiw.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/abd-al-malik-coin.jpg (And, indeed, did so in art and architecture as well, as in the construction of the Dome of the Rock.)\n\nTo bring this back to Muhammad, in particular, this is complicated by theories that the \"standing caliph\" in those coins might actually be Muhammad himself. This is unresolved, but there are plausible reasons for thinking that it might be.\n\nI'm rapidly running out of space here, but suffice it to say by the end of the reign of Abd al-Malik, Islamic artistic and religious norm was distinctly an-iconic, and there are some really interesting essays and discussions about the interplay and dialogue between Islamic and Byzantine iconoclasm from this period.\n\nThe second period, which I'm far less familiar with, relates to the \"Persian Miniature\" tradition (which was also practiced by the Ottomans and Mughals.) I'm far less familiar with the historiography or debates around these images of Muhammad or why they subsequently went out of fashion and so I'll withhold comment.\n\n-------------\n\nInteresting addenda:\n\nOne of the features of the above that I find to be interesting is that there are actually far more Muhammad's in the world than many people may realize. Because it is traditional to name sons Muhammad, that obviously isn't an especially useful name to have for identification purposes-- like being named John Smith only much more so. The result in countries like Egypt is that it's very common for men to be named Muhammad but then go by a second name. So to give some well known examples: Anwar Sadat was actually Muhammad Anwar Sadat. Hosni Mubarak is actually Muhammad Hosni Mubarak. The \"Yasser\" in Yasser Arafat is actually an adopted name but he was actually Muhammad Arafat. Etc.\n\n**Sourcewise**\n\nI'm running out of characters and am at work but can post some citations and additional reading later tonight.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>This question is a bit hard to answer, but I can give you some insight from a legal perspective. \n\nCriminal prosecutions of organizations (for example, a business firm, or in this instance a \"church\") are guided by the U.S. Attorneys' manual, which is promulgated by the Office of the U.S. Attorney. The relevant materials can be found [here.](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-28000-principles-federal-prosecution-business-organizations)\n\nHere are some guidelines from the manual:\n\n> Prosecutors should focus on wrongdoing by individuals from the very beginning of any investigation of corporate misconduct.  By focusing on building cases against individual wrongdoers, we accomplish multiple goals. First, we increase our ability to identify the full extent of corporate misconduct.  **Because a corporation only acts through individuals, investigating the conduct of individuals is the most efficient and effective way to determine the facts and the extent of any corporate misconduct.**  Second, a focus on individuals increases the likelihood that those with knowledge of the corporate misconduct will be identified and provide information about the individuals involved, at any level of an organization.  Third, we maximize the likelihood that the final resolution will include charges against culpable individuals and not just the corporation.\n\nMore specific information about prosecuting individuals can be found [here.](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-28000-principles-federal-prosecution-business-organizations#9-28.210)\n\nAnother relevant bit:\n\n> Prosecutors should be aware of the public benefits that can flow from indicting a corporation in appropriate cases. For instance, **corporations are likely to take immediate remedial steps when one is indicted for criminal misconduct** that is pervasive throughout a particular industry, and thus an indictment can provide a unique opportunity for deterrence on a broad scale. In addition, a corporate indictment may result in specific deterrence by changing the culture of the indicted corporation and the behavior of its employees.\n\nThere are practical difficulties to go along with these states goals. Specifically, many criminal charges require a level of intent, or *mens rea*, which really doesn't apply to an organization, because it's a legal fiction that must operate through individuals. While this doesn't necessarily prevent the criminal prosecution of an organization, it does make it more difficult if other members of the organization claim that the individual bad-actors were not acting on behalf of the organization, but were rather rogue agents. And this is, of course, what the Church of Scientology claimed:\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>My focus of study was criminology, so I can only comment and point you to the publicly available court documents. \n\nFirst, a short summary of events as I understand them: \n\nThe Church of Scientology begin a programme in the mid 1960s with the goal of infiltrating the American government. Key to these events were Misters Gerald Wolfe and Michael Meisner who get jobs in the Internal Revenue Service as clerk-typists. \n\nThere then being a campaign to illegally collect, copy, and remove government sensitive documents with the intention of curtailing the IRS investigation into the Church's tax-exempt status. \n\nBy 1975 there had been a number of successful break-ins and theft of documents from government agencies and numerous solicitor/lawyer offices.\n\nThe most important illegal event was when Meisner forged IRS identification. Wolfe's was legitimate, as he worked for the IRS. In conjunction to that was the plan to have Nathan Dodell being removed from his position as an Assistant US Attorney for the District of Columbia. Assistant Attorney Dodell's office was broken into numerous times and documents therein were removed, copied, and replaced according to the past efforts of Misters Wolfe, Meisner, and other members of the Church. \n\nDue to Misters Wolfe and Meisner continued unusual activities at the US Courthouse they were eventually questioned briefly by the FBI. Upon this they were ordered, by the Church, to L.A. to avoid decaton. \n\nWolfe was arrested for his forged documents. A warrant as then issued for Meisner and the connections to the Church became apparent. \n\nAs you noted, 11 persons were convicted. The centre of your question - why was the Church itself not convicted - can be answered simply thus:\n\na) the charges of conspiracy were brought against individuals\n\nb) the Church was still under investigation by the IRS for tax reasons, but itself was not under investigation for the conspiracy itself\n\nand \n\nc) Church of Scientology International (CSI), an entity incorporated in November 1981, had not held tax exemption. The California courts found in late 1997 that Scientology's structure of supposedly independent corporations was a unfounded and ordered to pay the damages.\n\nThe IRS dropped its long-standing tax demand against CSC and the other Scientology entities, instead collecting money from CSI on behalf of all Scientology entities, despite the supposedly independent status of the latter. \n\nTherefore, in this way the conspirators were convicted according to the proper court order and the Church was convicted according to the proper court order.\n\nEdited: I wrote this comment a while ago and didn't post it until now. \n\nTo expand - while corporations are currently recognised as persons for political activities they were not at the time. I do not know enough about the American political-legal system to expand in-depth. Furthermore, the actions of the individual were complex enough to determine that each conspirator had enough agency to plan these illegal activities and do so with full knowledge and a foresight for improvisation i.e. when unable to break into an office via piking the locked door for a number of hours Misters Wolfe and Meisner banged on it until it opened.\n\nDue to this a entirety cannot be changed as a whole. An example of this would be ENRON - the individuals were charged with various conspiracies and illegal activities but not the company itself. \n\nSources: \n\n\nFEDERAL AGENTS RAID SCIENTOLOGY CHURCH\nBy ANTHONY MARRO Special to The New York Times\nNew York Times (1857-Current file); Jul 9, 1977;\nProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851 - 2006) [PDF](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/us/20100226_SCIENTOLOGY_TIMELINE/1977raid.pdf) \n\n\n[US v Mary Sue Hubbard, et al., 78 U.S. 00401, 1977 Grand Jury Criminal Indictment (D.D.C.

It will also detail the \u201cgame-layer\u201d system that the community of AskHistorians terms \u201cFlair\u201d. Especially key to this presentation will be the rules of the subreddit and how they have evolved, focusing on how they are intended to both force and allow people to construct good and specific questions and answers within the forum.\nAs part of this, the introduction will also include a brief history of the host-website \u201cReddit\u201d, along with a description of its structure; there will be a discussion around how such hosts influence and shape their subaltern forums (of which AskHistorians is only one of many). This presentation will end with a brief history of AskHistorians itself, focusing on concrete changes in policy which took it from a small forum with a handful of readers to a powerhouse of 350,000 regular subscribers and millions of casual visitors.\n\nThis introduction will focus closely on what AskHistorians is and how it operates, and it is conceived that anyone listening to this presentation will be equipped with enough information to fully understand the following presentations.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**An Institutional Model for Public History on the Web**\n\nAskHistorians is difficult to explain for those involved in conventional outreach through museums and institutions, because it doesn't really fit into the mould of \"outreach\" as it has usually been understood. This talk contrasts the outreach model of museums and public history sites, to the education model of universities and graduate studies programmes, to the \"mediator\" model of AskHistorians, in order to extract lessons about what engages members of the lay public on the web. Crucially, the goal of this talk is to explain the ways in which AskHistorians (AH) is not doing public history nor history education as they are understood, but rather something new.\n\nAH works on a system of approximation and mediation, trying to attract both laypeople and experts to an open space where they can interact and share knowledge. The goal is to give lay users not only the product of the historical process, but a glimpse at that process itself; AH readers come into contact with working historians, graduate students, and experts in related fields (Linguistics, archaeology, social sciences) who volunteer to expose how their field actually works. Notably, AH is a space in which laypeople can be exposed to abstract discussion of historiography as well as specific discussion of historical events and people. Allowing readers' curiosity to guide discussion has produced unexpected results that would not have come out of a conventional outreach model where the agenda is set entirely by the institution.\n\nThe talk's goal is to clarify for the audience an abstracted model of how AH operates as an institution, and how institutions of its kind might be classified together into a new media form of public history.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Creating a Diverse and Inclusive Space**\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to situate the challenges of creating a diverse and inclusive space for all history enthusiasts. AskHistorians has become tremendously successful in its ability to connect historians to the public and foster enthusiasm for the study of the past. However there are significant challenges to creating such an environment, notably the traditional lack of accountability on anonymous internet spaces, as well as larger challenges of integrating social and subaltern history in a public forum.\n\nJust as the historical establishment has begun to include voices from outside the mainstream, AskHistorians has likewise embraced a model that prizes diversity and inclusivity. One of the primary challenges of a space like AskHistorians a greater popularity for certain aspects of history (namely Western political and military history.) Although we pride ourselves on being a space where anyone can ask a question about anything, we strive to make sure that there is space created for those who pursue historical interests outside of the mainstream. We make a concerted effort to recruit experts in under-represented fields, and to use their knowledge in ways that brings their area of study to the mainstream of AskHistorians. We also create weekly threads that allow for diverse discussions of historical topics outside of our usual user-generated questions.\n\nBecause we want AskHistorians to be a space where anyone who loves history feels safe and included, we maintain an extremely strict code of conduct that insists on civility and respect from all users. We hold our users accountable in a way that is rare for internet spaces. Users who make use of oppressive or offensive language are banned immediately. Maintaining AskHistorians as an inclusive and diverse community is integral to our mission, and ensures that we will continue to grow as a unique form of historical outreach.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n**\"A Culture of Curiosity\": The Challenges of Growing Your Audience from Scratch**\n\nMuch has been written about the potential of \u201cnew media\u201d for disseminating research and providing historical information \u2013 but making good content available is only one half of the equation. As important to the process of diffusion is creating an appreciative audience for the work. This \u2018ideal\u2019 audience - a curious, creative, tolerant audience - will actively seek out and explore all aspects of the historical information provided, broadening their horizons along the way.\nAskHistorians, the world\u2019s largest online historical forum, has created such an audience. The forum today is well established, with over 365,000 subscribers. But despite its large size, AskHistorians boasts refreshingly positive social expectations between its users; above all, those users seek to ask good questions and provide quality answers, while maintaining a safe atmosphere. This \u2018ideal\u2019 culture was also grown from scratch. Throughout the three years of its existence, the AskHistorians volunteer administration team, along with the users themselves, either took advantage of, or put in place a range of social and architectural strategies which encourage and reward the desired curiosity.\n\nThis presentation will focus on how the volunteers and audience of AskHistorians instilled and promoted their \u201cculture of curiosity\u201d. It will address the multifaceted nature of such a culture \u2013 how it was born both out of repeating social practice, but was also structured and guided by a hierarchy. It will address problems of authority and credibility in an online, democratic space and how those factors impact on curiosity. It will also discuss anonymity and the effects that has on approachability.\n\nOverall, it seeks to highlight how AskHistorians created its large, engaged audience and draw lessons from these experiences, illustrating the challenges and rewards of online engagement.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\n**Creating a Space for Lay Practitioners**\n\nAskHistorians is an outlet though which non-professional and amateur historians can share their knowledge and love of the subject with those who are equally interested. While our audiance is neormous, only 12% of our experts actually work in history or a related field. Fully 35% of our certified experts are self-taught, non-professionals or amateurs - this represents a significant portion of our knowledge base.\n\nFor these expert users, AskHistorians validates their years of self-study by not only allowing them to teach others, but also to meet professionals in their field and discuss issues with them one-on-one. It is an opportunity to expand their knowledge, obtain new source material, and test hypotheses in a safe environment. This kind of interaction can inspire non-professional and amateur historians to engage with history at a deeper level than ever before, and make history more a part of their life; specific activities seen so far include returning to school for a degree or by changing their career to be more in line with their interests.\n\nIn this talk, I will be looking at the different ways in which AskHistorians creates a space\u2014which is otherwise lacking\u2014for lay practitioners of history to express and develop their interest. I will also look at two case-studies in which interacting with the forum eventually led lay experts to make history more a part of their lives, in the one by returning to school for a degree, and in the second through the recognition that history was indeed a subject they loved.\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Dionysius Exiguus came up with the modern world's most-used system for numbering years (Anno Domini, sometimes rebranded Common Era) in the early sixth century. For hundreds of years, however, the few Europeans dating documents preferred to continue the traditional system of dating by regnal year. By the high Middle Ages, chroniclers like Herman of Reichanau are numbering their entries by A.D. year, but we're still not quite at the point where they're common usage in charters or in people's minds. (Court testimony from even the late Middle Ages sometimes has people figure dates from either kings' regnal year or with reference to more local events). Just to make things even more interesting, Hebrew calendar years are *also* a creation of the High Middle Ages.\n\nAnd yet, in these 4-5 centuries of only scattershot use of the A.D. system, there are isolated instances of writers who *do* pick it up and run with it. Bede in 7th-8th century England is perhaps the most famous. How did they do it? Easter!\n\nThe Christian liturgical calendar(s) involves some feasts that are fixed to a date and others that are more fluid. Most importantly and controversially, Easter, the history (and present, see: Catholic versus Orthodox) of whose dating is a giant mess. The early Church decided on a date for Easter that *relates to* the vernal equinox. \n\nBut here's the thing. As you know, and as ancient people knew, years are not actually 365 days. Hence the introduction of leap years. And the presence of leap years (in the Julian calendar, which has too many leap years and so would be a problem by the sixteenth century) combined with the decision that Easter must always be a Sunday meant that the date of Easter had to be *calculated*. Indeed, this *computus* was a crucial duty of the early medieval clergy. They made table after table that calculated and listed the dates of Easter for centuries to come. So even across centuries of sporadic *functional* use of AD/CE, the medieval Church placed an absolutely premium on keeping track of the advancement of years in terms fixed to the date once presumed to be either the conception or birth of Christ.\n\nThere are some conspiracy theories floating around about \"phantom time\" that jump off from just that lack of consistent *functional* use of AD dating in Western Christian sources. These fall apart on a couple of grounds. First, the Hijri or Islamic calendar was in use from the mid-7th century, and we can compare its advancement of years to the European.

                "answer": "<p>The Middle ages (and the earliest Modern period that followed) was an era before uniforms as we understand them. Compared to say, the 18th century, there wasn\u2019t a standardized, color-coded way to tell friend from foe. Instead, there were a variety of kinds of battlefield identifications used in different times and places in the medieval era to identify individuals, groups within an army, and armies. Because I study the later Middle Ages, I will discuss the period from around 1250 through 1500 or so. I will leave it to others to discuss battlefield identification in the early and high middle ages.\n\nBattlefield identification had always been an issue. In the 13th century, the introduction of closed-faced [helms](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Topfhelm_DHM_transparent.png) made personal identification on the battlefield and in the tournament even more difficult. While older scholarship mentions helms as the impetus for crests and heraldry, more recent work questions this -  schemes to identify knights existed prior to closed-faced helmets. That said, in the 13th century means of identification became much, much more common. In the late 12th and 13th century, two ways of identifying individual soldiers developed. The first was heraldric surcoats and shields - coloring the surcoat (the loose robe worn over the armour in the 13th and 14th centuries) and shield with specific colors in specific patterns to identify a particular man at arms. The systems of heraldry is much more complicated than this, and relates to the construction of the knight as a social identity in the 13th and 14th century, but the battlefield/tournament use is still important to remember. The second was the [crest](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/KHM_Wien_B_74_-_Great_helm_of_Albert_von_Prankh,_14th_century,_front.jpg), a sculpted \u2018topper\u2019 for the helm generally made of parchment or leather. The design on this would often be somehow identifying, though it was not necessarily related to the user\u2019s heraldry. Finally, in the 14th and 15th centuries as plate armour developed armour itself was decorated in ways that were individualized (for those who could afford it). The Black Prince\u2019s Guantlets had gadlings (brass knuckles, basically) in the shape of a lion, one of the animals emblematic of the English monarchy. In the Early modern period, armour decoration became more developed - the armour of say, Otto Heinrich, Count Palatinate of the Rheine, was gold and black, to match his colors. Charles V had his armour decorated with the symbols of his domains - primarily Burgundy (and more specifically, the Low Countries, which he had inheritted from the Duchy of Burgundy). Such decorated armour would help identify its wearers to friends (so that they could rally to defend them) and foes (so that they would know to capture them alive).\n\nThe effect of this was that an individual man at arms could now be identified by those who knew his crest and heraldry or his armour - such as by people who knew him personally, people fighting next to him, or (as the system of heraldry developed) professional heralds. However, since they are individual identification neither crests nor heraldric colors helps identify which side someone is on unless you know which side he is on, indvidually. That said, heraldry and crests served another important role - when soldiers were captured for ransom, it allowed their easy identification. It also allowed for the identification of the dead after battle (assuming that the corpses had not already been stripped, as often happened). \n\nA solution that we see in the 15th century is the introduction of livery coats to identify the men in a certain lord\u2019s retinue. This is most extensively used in England during the period of the Wars of the Roses. A livery coat was a garment provided by a lord to his retainers (contracted soldiers) as part of their contract of \u2018livery and maintenance\u2019 (along with pay, food and wine/beer). It would be in a specific color, that would not necessarily be related to the Lord\u2019s heraldric colors, and often bear a badge associated with the lord (again, not related to the lord\u2019s heraldry, necessarily). For example, Richard III\u2019s men wore a badge with a boar on it. Wearing livery allowed men to identify the fellow members of their retinue, but didn\u2019t necessarily identify which side every retinue was on.\n\nEDIT: Tobias Capwell has also argued that the decoration on a number of late 15th century painted sallets [like this one](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a7/bb/c7/a7bbc784097587a05218bfb2643ffccb.jpg) were painted as a form of 'unit identification' by groups of medium cavalryman fighting for the city of Nuremberg. Essentially a group would all have monster faces painted onto their helmets. The evidence is not conclusive, but the idea is evocative at the very least.\n\nFinally, there were army identifiers. Famously, Henry V had the English Army at Agincourt wear the red cross of St George. Similarly, in the late 15th century the Duke of Burgundy had his soldiers wear a red st Andrew\u2019s cross to identify themselves. In [this illumination from a swiss chronicle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Schilling_murten_bern.jpg\n)you can see the soldiers of Burgundy wearing an \u2018x\u2019 shaped cross fighting swiss soldiers with a \u2018+\u2019 shaped cross, the cross of Switzerland. These army identifiers might be worn on a livery coat, or sewn onto the clothing, or displayed on armour in some way. However, note that the soldiers are not wearing anything resembling a \u2018uniform\u2019 - the cross is a modification to their existing clothing, not a uniform garment worn by everyone.\n\nIn the end, there was not a uniform (heh) way of identifying one side from the another on the medieval battlefield. Friendly fire incidents did occur - at the Battle of Barnet in 1471 some Lancastrians mistook their own reinforcements for Yorkists, throwing the Lancastrians into disarray as they fought each other. However it should be noted that Barnet was fought in the fog - unusually low visibility for a medieval battle (though Towton 10 years earlier was fought in a snowstorm). Indeed compared with the smoke of an early modern battlefield, visiblity on a medieval battlefield would be relatively clear (though this clarity would decrease as the 15th and 16th centuries progressed). \n\nIt is important to remember that the melee was not necessarily the normal shape of medieval combat. In infantry warfare especially, tight formations were the norm. As Christine de Pisan wrote in 1409 (as quoted in Keen\u2019s \u2018Medieval Warfare\u2019): \u2018Two great evils can follow from a disordered formation: one is that the enemies can more easily break into it; the other is that the formations may be so compressed that they cannot fight. Thus it is necessary to keep a formation in ranks, and tight and joined together like a wall.\u2019 In this case it would be obvious who your friends were (the man next to you) and who your enemies were (the guy in front of you trying to jab a pike into your face). Contemporary military historians do not necessarily think of pre-modern battles as bloodthirsty free-for-alls, but instead a series of attacks and counter-attacks that could at times seem quite furtive as each side sought to maintain their cohesion and exploit any weaknesses of the enemy. That said, there were times - when cavalry charged, when reinforcements arrived, or when a group of men fled, that things could get quite chaotic. Then a badge of your army or lord might help you...or it might not.\n\nSources:\n\nMoffat, Ralph - THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING HARNEST:\nARMOUR, HERALDRY AND RECOGNITION\nIN THE MELEE from Battle and Bloodshed, the Medieval World at War, Lorna Bleach and Keira Borrill, editors.\n\nCapwell, Tobias - Masterpieces of European Arms and Armour at the Wallace Collection\n\nKeen, Maurice, ed. - Medieval Warfare, A History\n\nStrickland and Hardy - the Great Warbow\n\nEdge and Paddock - Arms and Armour of the Medieval Knight\n\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>There are two major factors governing the linguistic difficulty of *Gawain* as opposed to *Canterbury Tales*: dialect and poetry form. Chaucer is planted firmly in the world of the London clerical bureaucracy, clerks writing first and foremost for a \"reading circle\" type audience of other clerks, whose literary influence through \"reading for fun\" and through essentially running local and national bureaucracy did a lot to standardize the Midland-Kent dialects swirling around London into standard English.\n\nThe anonymous *Gawain* poet (usually known as the *Pearl* poet, although there are a few scholars who have questioned whether the two poems were *really* written by the same author), on the other hand, wrote in a northwestern-ish dialect, a version of the West Midlands dialect. That places the vocabulary a step removed from what we know in Chaucer--a step removed from the type of Middle English that would flow into early modern.\n\nThe second major factor is the type of verse. *Canterbury Tales* is governed first of all by meter with different rhyming patterns falling at the end of the line. SGGK uses alliterative verse, a specific format heralding back to Old English/Anglo-Saxon heritage that was undergoing a revival in just the part of England where SGGK's dialect places its author. The alliteration demands of alliterative verse not only suggest that a wider vocabulary would be necessary to make the patterns work--we think that using as wide a vocabulary as possible was part of the literary game and fun for authors writing in the style. I wish I remembered the exactly number--I think SGGK uses something like twelve or thirteen different words for \"man.\" \n\nAs far as contemporary perceptions of language--yes, medieval people recognized both the general borders of many modern vernacular languages *and* the differences in dialect. Sometimes this is explicit. In mid-14C Germany, Heinrich von N\u00f6rdlingen wrote to his friend Margaretha Ebner to tell her that he was sending a gift: a book by earlier mystical author Mechthild of Magdeburg. But, Heinrich said, *her* German was difficult so he had had a group of friends translate it into \"our\" German. Mechthild had originally written in Middle Low German (northern); the Bavarian-born Ebner's primary language was Middle High German. (It's tough to say whether medieval Low and High German qualify as \"separate languages\"--you can certainly cherry-pick individual texts that seem like it, but they'd be the ends of the spectrum while many people spoken and wrote somewhere in the middle).\n\nThe activity of scribes suggests a similar view. Monks and nuns acquiring books for their convents \"translate\" freely from what we would call one dialect to another. They are clearly quite adept with the dialect of their exemplar, but for their own convent, it's easier to pop the text into the local dialect.\n\nHonestly, the biggest difference is just *practice.* SGGK is tough because of the vocabulary (which is apparent already by comparing scholarly translations!), but take something in the middle difficulty range between CT and SGGK--like Piers Plowman B. You're probably going to struggle at the beginning, but by the end, you'll practically be able to speak in Langland's verse and vocabulary.</p>",

Also, since folk music was and still is performed at local celebrations like weddings or religious holidays, it reflects the tastes, if not the exact words, of everyday people.\n\nMany songs specifically celebrate a \u201ccolleen\u201d (from the Gaelic cailin, literally meaning \u201cyoung girl\u201d), who is a \u201ccountry/peasant girl\u2026associated with a rural landscape and way of life\u201d (O\u2019Conner, 2009). Take these lyrics from \u201cStar of the County Down,\u201d for instance:\n\nFrom a boreen green came a sweet colleen  \nAnd she smiled as she passed me by.  \nShe looked so sweet from her two bare feet  \nTo the sheen of her nut brown hair.  \n\nIn general, there is an emphasis on the beauty of the woman\u2019s hair or eyes. Two other good examples are \u201cThe Black Velvet Band\u201d:\n\nHer eyes they shown like diamonds  \nI thought her the queen of the land  \nAnd her hair, it hung over her shoulder  \nTied up with a black velvet band  \n\nAnd, \u201cThe Rose of Tralee\u201d:\n\nShe was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer,  \nYet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me;  \nOh no, 'twas the truth in her eyes ever dawning,  \nThat made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.  \n\nSo, what general trends about beauty might you be able to draw from these examples? \n\nThe descriptions tend to be metaphorical and naturalistic, connecting the woman and the landscape (\u201crose of the summer,\u201d \u201cqueen of the land\u201d). Also, the songs often emphasize that the women are from a specific place in Ireland \u2013 County Down is in Northern Ireland and Tralee is in County Kerry in Southwestern Ireland. I think this adds a patriotic flavor \u2013 these women are beautiful because they represent Ireland itself, forming a \u201cnational feminine ideal\u201d (O\u2019Conner, 2009). \n\nTherefore, the peasant man in your question may not have been pressured to value a narrow physical \u201ctype\u201d of woman. Instead, he may have enjoyed praising beautiful women through song, or connecting specific women that he loved in his life to beauties described in song or to his love for his homeland.\n\nSources\n\nO'Connor, Barbara (2009) Colleens and comely maidens: representing and performing Irish femininity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

                "answer": "<p>**Yes, to a significant degree.**\n\nOne of the popular misconceptions about the rise of the Nazi Party is that it was solely a populist movement driven from below. That's true to a large degree, but the Nazis enjoyed a great deal of support from \"high society,\" wealthy industrialists, princes and princesses, as well as culturally significant figures. /u/commiespaceinvader is unfortunately ill, but he recommends [*High Society in the Third Reich* by Fabrice d\u2019Almeida](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n07/christopher-clark/vases-tea-sets-cigars-his-own-watercolours) if you're interested in learning more. I'd also recommend Henry Ashby Turner's *German Big Business and the rise of Hitler*, even though Turner's thesis is that business *did not* in general fund Hitler's rise.\n\nI personally don't have a copy of either, but I do have Ian Kershaw's *Hitler* as well as Richard Evans' three-volume *Reich* trilogy and Weber's *Hitler's First War* which is less helpful for this question. Evans' *The Coming of the Third Reich* has a significant amount of information about your question.\n\nDuring the 1920s and early 1930s, many of Germany's big firms (I.G. Farben and Krupp were just two examples) became disillusioned with the Weimar system. As Evans writes, \"The influence it had enjoyed before 1914, still more during the war and the postwar era of inflation, now seemed to be drastically diminished. Moreover, its public standing, once so high, had suffered badly as a result of financial and other scandals that had surfaced during the inflation. People who lost their fortunes in dubious investments searched for someone to blame.\"\n\nIn many cases, they began to blame big business and industry. As the parties of the left grew in influence, these large corporations sought ways to protect themselves. They turned to groups like the Nationalist Party (with whom they had a long association) and the Nazi Party, which in 1930 had undergone a split that purged the left-wing \"socialist\" portion of the National Socialists. \n\nIn 1932, Hitler spoke to the Industry Club in Dusseldorf, appealing to the audience by denouncing Marxism and offering general industrial views. This 2.5-hour presentation didn't make much of an effect at the time, Evans writes, but it laid the groundwork for future contributions by big business. Fritz Thyssen, a wealthy industrialist, was already on board by this time, and as the Depression deepened, other industrialists began to climb onboard the bandwagon.\n\nBy the 1933 elections, Evans writes, \"Hitler was backed in his election campaign by a fresh, indeed unprecedented flow of funds from industry.\"\n\nThe industrialists tended to disdain Hitler, but Hitler had allies who were more friendly, people like Goering, von Papen and Schacht. In February, Hitler delivered another address, this time to a private audience, and declared that democracy was incompatible with business interests, that Marxism had to be crushed, and that the forthcoming election was crucial to that effort. \n\nAfter that address, they paid up even though some wanted their contributions to be split between the Nazis and other conservative coalition partners. The Nazi Party wasn't alone in the 1933 election; it was part of a right-wing coalition government, and the industrialists believed that these other coalition partners would be able to moderate and control the Nazis to some degree.\n\nWith the industrialists' money, however, the Nazis were able to spread their message and champion the idea of Hitler rebuilding Germany during the Depression and restoring order in the streets from the Marxist menace. Hitler in return promised a huge program of road-building and infrastructure, coupled with tax breaks for auto manufacturers.\n\nAfter the 1933 elections, leading businessmen and corporations founded the \"Adolf Hitler Donation of the German Economy,\" a program that steered 30 million Reichsmarks into Nazi coffers over the following year. This was intended to stave off the \"forced contributions\" and *de facto* extortion that the SA and local party members exerted from time to time. It didn't work very well, but Hitler helped the industrialists anyway with his program. As Evans writes, \"With the trade unions smashed, socialism off the agenda in any form, and new arms and munitions contracts already looming over the horizon, big business could feel satisfied that the concessions it had made to the new regime had largely been worth it.\"\n\nOverall, Germany's biggest industrialists and corporations supported the Nazi rise as part of their general support for conservative, right-wing government in Germany. They hoped that the other conservative parties would dilute and moderate the Nazis' influence, but the Nazis had their own plan, using this funding to push an aggressive and populist agenda that made them the leading figures in the coalition government and ultimately to one-party rule.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>There's a great book which discusses the banal and unsuspicious way that Hitler rose to power, written by a German in 1939, called *Defying Hitler*.  The author was a regular German, not a Jew or other persecuted minority, yet he writes clearly about the threat of fascism and how Hitler was often misjudged during his rise, in many cases due to the turbulent nature of recent German history.  Germans who had lived through the 1870-1932 period were used to enormous political changes, and when Hitler began agitating for power, they often took a cynical view of his true threat.  Discounting his rhetoric as empty demagoguery was very common.\n\nThe book is really chilling and is very effective at illustrating just how easy it is to delude oneself into hoping for the best and ignoring all the warning signs.  Here's an interesting passage I just flipped to, in which the author discusses the implications of Hitler's election to Reichschancellor in 1933 with his father on the night of the election:\n\n> That evening I discussed the prospects of the new government with my father.  We agreed that it had a good chance of doing a lot of damage, but not much chance of surviving very long: a deeply reactionary government, with Hitler as its mouthpiece [the author had previously discussed how many intellectuals viewed Hitler as a clown].  Apart from this, it did not really differ much from the two governments that had succeeded Bruning's.  Even with the Nazis it would not have a majority in the Reichstag.  Of course that could always be dissolved, but the government had a clear majority of the population against it, in particular the working class which would probably go Communist, now that the Social Democrats had completely discredited themselves.  One could prohibit the Communists, but that would only make them more dangerous.  In the meantime the government would be likely to implement reactionary social and cultural measures, with some anti-Semitic additions to please Hitler.  That would not attract any of its opponents to its side.  Foreign policy would probably be a matter of banging the table.  There might be an attempt to rearm.  That would automatically add the outside world to the 60 percent of the home population who were against the government.  Besides, who were the people who had suddenly started voting Nazi in the last three years?  Misguided ignoramuses for the most part, victims of propaganda, a fluctuating mass that would fall apart at the first disappointment.  No, all things considered, this government was not cause for alarm.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I grew up with a close relative who I deeply respect in many ways, and who is almost definitely responsible for my love of history, but who routinely denied the Holocaust in ways that at the time as a young impressionable teen I thought were innocuous (\"Well, he doesn't think it didn't *totally* happen, he just has some issues with the numbers being inflated!\" \"Okay, I guess he's being a *little* unreasonable, but he just doesn't like Israel, it's not a Jew thing!\"). I eventually knew enough to not take his word for granted, but still didn't really know how to discuss the topic with him without looking like an idiot, as he was (and is) a fantastic debater with a very deep knowledge of history. Over time however, as I grew older, got into serious history study, and learned more about the Holocaust, I then tried to 'take him on' and talk it over with him. The first few times, he made the same arguments, but they clearly didn't hold water anymore. The next few times, he was far more reluctant to even begin the conversation. But, eventually, one night the truth came out. What used to be an issue of numbers and historical evidence became an issue of 'rootless Jews' furthering their agenda. Discussions about the Holocaust inevitably ended up in discussions about an all-encompassing 'Zionism'. Any attempts at civil discussion would end in terms such as 'Jew sympathizer' being thrown about (honestly wish I was making that up). \n\nBecause of that experience, every time I hear someone deny the Holocaust - which unfortunately happens quite a bit once I mention that it's my field of study - I press them on why. Civilly, but strongly. I've found that the results are consistent across almost every individual: What begins as some 'innocent questions' gradually become the same antisemitic rhetoric that's been used for centuries. The exceptions are those who had just taken on the belief of an antisemitic parent without thinking critically.\n\nPlease, to those of you who do not consider yourselves antisemites but forgive those who deny the Holocaust and the number of Jews who perished because they are close to you personally, or because you feel they may have genuine issues with historical methods, or because you feel that their political anti-Zionism is just \"partially clouding\" their judgement, I implore you to actually discuss the facts with those who talk this trash. Almost inevitably, after a bit of pressing, the antisemitism comes out. Even if you can't change their mind - which, more often than not, is unfortunately the case - by exposing their motives, those around them will be far less likely to defend them or their arguments.\n\nEDIT: Additionally (as someone rightfully pointed out in a private message), there is a difference between denial and genuine lack of knowledge. If someone literally doesn't know the facts surrounding the Holocaust or is unaware of the history of the period, it is not their fault for not having been educated - that's where we, as historians, need to do our job so that their ignorance of the subject isn't exploited.</p>",

Leuchter Jr., a man who helped revolutionize capital punishment in the United States.  Because he has this knowledge about \"humanely\" executing others, he was asked to provide his opinion on the \"legitimacy\" of Auschwitz as an extermination site.  He damaged the site \"in the name of research\" (research which actual experts have said was flawed for various reasons).  Even though this man was not a historian, a scientist with experience testing for chemicals, or even a medical doctor, he became embraced by deniers as an \"expert\" for no reason other than he knew how to \"humanely\" gas an individual prisoner.\n\nFor more on this watch the documentary Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A.

Not with how to challenge denial, as that's always been fairly straightforward in the ways you described, but because the Holocaust is such a difficult topic.\n\nIt's hard for me to delve into the numbers and to understand the enormity of what happened. It's hard, as a human being, to ever start to understand the magnitude of wars and genocides, and it makes my head spin imagining it.\n\nThat may be one of the biggest boons to deniers. They are arguing something that appeals to most normal people; that there's no way others could do something so evil and grotesque as commit a genocide like the Holocaust. In my experience at least, it's painful to even think it, and to grasp the fact that human beings are capable of such acts. Even just thinking in detail about the logistics of a gas chamber can make one's heart beat fast and strain to reject the truth.\n\nI think that's the biggest argument for education, and for awareness of the denier phenomenon. The point isn't just to remember anti-Semitism, it's to understand what types of evil can exist and commit acts of horror. Holocaust deniers prey on those who are unaware, who don't want to believe, and who are taught not to believe. But to avoid someday seeing them relegate the Holocaust to the status of myth requires tackling the injustice of denial wherever it exists, hard as it is. Even though it can bring any normal person to tears to really see the testimonies of the survivors, it has to be done.\n\nThat's part of why this sub is so important to me.

                "answer": "<p>So I am not sure that Ciricione was saying that _all_ Presidents from Truman to H.W. Bush were advised this. I suspect he was saying that Presidents have been advised this over various points in time \u2014 between Truman and H.W. Bush. \n\nThe big point here is that the \"nuclear taboo\" \u2014 the non-use of nuclear weapons after WWII \u2014 is a norm and not a \"rule.\" It took time to get established. It gets challenged regularly. It didn't have to even happen \u2014 if Eisenhower had been President during the early Korean War, perhaps they would have been used? There is a lot of contingency there.\n\nAnd I just want to note that you say \"knowing the almost certain outcome\" \u2014 but the outcomes are not as certain as you may think. E.g., there was no mutual assured destruction during the Korea War (none really with the USSR until the early 1960s; you do have a _deterrence_ structure in the 1950s, but it is not mutually assured, and a lot of it is about the Soviets threatening Europe not the USA) or against non-nuclear powers (e.g. Vietnam). Yes, the USA was not going to nuke the USSR after the 1960s but there are lots of other possible places where nukes could have come into play that do not involve straightforward deterrence theory. And there are also many ways to use nukes \u2014 they are not just \"big bombs dropped on cities,\" they can also be \"small weapons used tactically\" by the 1950s. That makes them seem less \"special\" to many military and even some political figures (Eisenhower and Nixon were both of the mind that tactical nukes were basically \"non-special\").\n\nSome well-known and well-documented examples:\n\n* Truman and the Berlin Crisis. Advisors recommended to Truman that he launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the USSR. Truman declined, though he did authorize moving non-nuclear assemblies to the region. \n\n* Truman and the Korean War. Could have used nukes. Some generals wanted to use nukes. Plenty of popular discussion about the use of nukes. Moved non-nuclear assemblies to the region, but opted not to use nukes. By 1949 Truman was very dubious about the utility of nuclear weapons in military conflicts and also very aware of the fact that he required international support to wage a conflict of this nature.\n\n* Eisenhower and the Taiwan Strait crisis. Threatened to use nukes against China. Lots of talk at top levels of possibility of using nukes. Willingness by Eisenhower to potentially use them. Military advisors recommended them. Ultimately didn't need to use them. (This incident, as an aside, led to China starting their own nuclear program.)\n\n* Ex-President Eisenhower recommended to both Kennedy and Johnson that they use nukes in Laos and Vietnam. Lots of people talked about possibility of using them in Vietnam at different levels. Ultimately neither President was interested.\n\n* There was some discussion about possible use of nukes in the Nixon administration but ultimately a much lesser sort of pressure. Nixon himself was interested in nukes in Vietnam, and stated in 1985 that he considered using nukes four times during his administration (Vietnam, the Yom-Kippur War, the Sino-Soviet border disputes, and the 1971 India-Pakistan War... yeah, don't ask me what he intended to do with them, this is just what he told Time magazine). Much of the Nixon admin papers remains closed so it is hard to know more. What is interesting about Nixon is that he seems to have been the one interested in nukes, whilst his military people had internalized the idea that they were not actually all that useful.\n\n* I don't know of strong pressures from the top on Ford, Carter, or Reagan to use nukes in any of their conflicts. I suspect there were no truly serious ones. By this point the Soviets have true MAD capability, and the Chinese have the capability to do real damage (though not MAD), so any possible use would have to be in smaller conflicts. This does not mean that the world was not ever _close_ to using weapons \u2014 we are speaking only on whether presidents were encouraged to use them by top advisors. The \"taboo\" was thoroughly in place at this point \u2014 if you were going to use nukes, you'd have to argue why nukes would be more useful in a given situation when they didn't appear to have been useful in previous ones. Again, this does not mean these were anti-nuclear presidents. Reagan did much to accelerate and encourage the nuclear arms race. But he didn't really contemplate striking first. (The Soviets were not always sure of that, though!)\n\n* Lastly, G.H.W. Bush \u2014 during the first Gulf War there was explicit talk about the possibility of using them in Iraq. Basically it was implied that if Saddam Hussein set the Kuwaiti oil fields on fire, or used chemical or biological weapons against US troops, we might use nukes in retaliation (in a low-yield, tactical way \u2014 not targeting cities). In fact, we now know that Saddam _thought_ we would use nukes if they set the oil fields on fire... and set them on fire anyway. (Which is an interesting example of nuclear deterrence _not_ working, in a sense.) But the reality of these pressures seems to have not been extreme; Bush was not interested in using tactical nukes. \n\n* Though we are well beyond our remit in terms of the 20-year rule, it might be worth noting that there was much talk of using low-yield \"bunker-busting\" nukes in the GWB administration, and considerable funds applied to the question. Anecdotally I have heard military sorts of people talk about the advantages such a weapon would have in targeting underground facilities like Fordow. Presumably these discussions also took place at higher levels. Cheney, at least in public statements, said they were not interested in using nuclear weapons in such cases.\n\nAnyway \u2014 the authoritative source on this topic is Nina Tannewald, _The Nuclear Taboo: The United States and the Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons Since 1945_ (Cambridge University Press, 2007). It discusses all of the above examples mentioned, and several others. </p>",

Couples would have sex with their children or relatives in the bed, there wasn't the sense of taboo or privacy around it that we have today.\n\nI'm also going to choose to interpret this as \"when did sex become private in Western Europe\" and I will draw on a [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ebapq/when_how_and_why_did_the_view_on_nudity_and/cjxz33y) and a blog entry I just [published on the topic, here.](http://www.annalspornographie.com/?p=133) and from my book Annals Of Pornographie: How Porn Became Bad \n\n\n\nThe term you are looking for is called \"the invention of privacy.\"\n\nThe works and research in this field is somewhat obscure and highly complicated. The most important book, *La Vie du privee--The History of Private Life*--is nearly four volumes long. The other major (recent) work by McKeon is about 1000 pages and very difficult to read as a layman (or even as an expert...) and is called *The Secret History of Domesticity*\n\nPrior to the sixteenth century in most of Europe, and well into the seventeenth century, there was no particular reaction, positive or negative about semipublic sex, nudity or sexual organs. These things were common, from what we know of surviving records in London, Paris, Florence, Venice, Milan, and other city records. For example, there were Cock and Hen bars in London, which would be equivalent to a singles bar today. In these clubs, what we would call nonpenatrative sex was on more or less public display, and indeed, it was common to see it in the streets as well. \n\nPart of the reason for that is because there was no police force to enforce public decorum as we have today. And even if they were, they would not necessarily have had the authority to do anything about public lewdness, drunkenness, or other misbehavior as we would see it. In fact, it took nearly a half-century after the establishment of the Metropolitan Police in London for them to feel as if they had sufficient authority to punish morality offenders (see the numerous King and Queen declarations on this, esp. Victoria's relation with the Police).\n\nThe larger part of it, however, had to do with 'the invention of privacy.' What I mean by that is that in the late middle ages and early renaissance, it was quite common for households to be one room, and in particular, to have one shared bed for the entire family. This meant that children would be in bed and in all probability witness or be aware of their parents making their siblings. Here's Ian Moulton:\n\n>[Over the course of the seventeenth century] Bedchambers-and the beds themselves-slowly shifted from being common living areas (in lower-class homes) or sites for social gatherings (in upper-class ones) to being what they are today-private space for the single person or couple who sleep in them. Reading became dominantly private and silent rather than spoken and communal.\n\nThe shift happened because of two major reasons. The first is that building material became much cheaper and architectural knowledge became much more common, allowing the creation of multiple rooms, better heating, and what is termed 'the creation of the upstairs.'\n\nThe second reason is a little more complicated, and stems, essentially, from the Protestant Revolution touched off by Martin Luther.\n\nBetween 1100-1300 the Catholic Church tried to discourage concubinage and loose moral standards among the upper and lower classes, with greater or lesser success. In fact, it became one of their central concerns: surviving records of English Church courts indicate that sexual and marital cases made up for between 60-90% of all litigation. Although this was successful in many places, one of the places it was notably *unsuccessful* was in Rome, the capital of the Church and the center of the Christian world. This is something that was frequently satirized and mocked by humanist reformers such as Boccaccio and, of course, Aretino.\n\nAs Dabhoiwala notes in his Origins of Sex:\n\n>Sex was central to the Reformation\u2019s reshaping of the world. To Protestant eyes the Catholic church\u2019s whole attitude to sexual morality seemed pathetically lax and dishonest. Its priests were lecherous parasites: the ideal of clerical celibacy was no more than a joke. [Church] courts were not nearly fierce enough in pursing sexual offender and punishing their moral sins\u2026 Particularly scandalous was the toleration [and regulation] of prostitution. \n\nIndeed, Dabhoiwala continues: \u201c[Luther and other] protestants advanced a purer, more rigorous morality. The Catholic aspiration to celibacy was jettisoned as unrealistic and counter-productive\u2026 On the other hands, God\u2019s many pronouncements against whoredom were to be taken even more seriously: all sex outside marriage should be severely punished.\u201d\n\nSo, the general public did not really care one way or another about public display of private organs or sex. The Church did, but was not able to control the laity, thus helping Luther in his crusade and helping to create a sense of privacy in protestant culture. Look to my quotes from McKeon [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ebapq/when_how_and_why_did_the_view_on_nudity_and/cjxz33y) to understand more on that topic.\n\n\nThat covers the Protestants, but what about the Catholic reaction and Counter Reformation?\n\nEnvoys at the Council of Trent pointed out that some of Luther\u2019s critiques were correct: \u201cciting information garnered from an extensive visition of Bavaria in 1558, [an envoy] painted a dark picture. The vast majority of the parish clergy was ignorant and infected with heresy. Out of a hundred only three or four were not secretly married or keeping concubines, to the great scandal of the faithful.\u201d Furthermore, it was common for upper-class men to clandestinely marry or promise marriage to women of lower station to \u2018get into their pants,\u2019 and then, if she got pregnant, to deny ever having been married. \n\nThe result was the *Tamesti* which stated that \u201cwhereas clandestine  marriages had previously declared valid, though blameworthy, all would be deemed invalid unless celebrated before a priest and at least two witnesses.\u201d In O\u2019Malley\u2019s view \u201cNo single provision of the entire council affected the Catholic laity more directly than Tamesti\u2026 The approval and implementation of Tamesti meant that in the future the church recognized no marriages between Catholics as valid unless it had been witnessed by a priest.\u201d The intention and effects of Tamesti were, in a way, feminist in the sense that they sought to protect and enfranchise women against being abandoned due to clandestine marriages. \n\nThis debate, probably more than anything else, has had a profound impact and influence on our lives today. For example, in modern times we often consider anything that has to do with sex or sexuality as \u2018private\u2019 and something that should occur \u2018behind closed doors.\u2019 In the sixteenth, seventeenth, and even the early eighteenth centuries this was not necessarily the case (though it became increasingly so as time progressed). \n\nIn fact it was not it uncommon for sexual acts to take place in a bar or in public, and witnesses would think very little of it.\n\nAgain, this was a period where entire families would share the same bed and children were likely to know just how their parents made new siblings. The splitting of the private and public world that happened as a result of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation had an impact on the architecture of the home and the attitudes around sex. Occurring first among the upper classes, who were likely already accustomed to formalized and public marriages. They then began to be adopted by middle and lower classes, slowly at first and then with increasing rapidity until public and private life came to be a cultural standard.\n\nOf course, this is not to say that no one hid intercourse or tried to achieve privacy before this time period, but it was much different in cultural context.\n\n**Edit:** do see below for /u/sunagainstgold 's discussion of pre -16th century European ideas. My discussion, and my research, is largely limited to Reformation and post-reformation Europe. Invention of privacy is my term, not someone else's, I use it to talk about the formalization and creation of the concepts of \"privacy\" and rights to/demands of it starting in the 16th century and carrying to the present day. And as I've noted in the last sentence, there were attempts to seek out private spaces, but these private spaces were not *privacy* as we would understand it.\n\n\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I love Liechtenstein!\n\nThe short answer is three parts: **a late start**, **good alliances**, **not being a belligerent.**\n\n**A Late Start**\n\nFirst of all, you wouldn't consider Liechtenstein to be a \"country\" or even an \"independent principality\" by contemporary European standards until 1719. Before that, the area was barely occupied, and variously controlled to different degrees by the Holy Roman Empire, and was also traded around various dynasties and families for a couple of hundred years. That's why we don't think about Liechtenstein being captured in the Swabian War in 1499, or the Thirty Years' War from 1618-1648, for examples, because it wasn't Liechtenstein then. It was a couple of little hamlets and a castle or two. It doesn't even get a mention in the Wikipedia articles on those conflicts.\n\nCompare this with Vatican City---which was either trying to control the rest of the peninsula or the whole world since about the 8th century, being controlled by the locals, or getting booted out to France---or compare with Malta, which has been occupied for 7,000 years and conquered by every one with a boat from the Romans to the Muslims to the Normans to the French. Plus the British got Malta for a signature in the Treaty of Paris. So yeah, a late start is reason number one.\n\n**Good Alliances**\n\nThings are pretty quiet in Liechtenstein during from 1719 onward until Napoleon starts conquering much of Europe. Most notably for our story his victories at Ulm and Austerlitz in 1805 lead to the Treaty of Pressburg (aka Bratislava), which pretty much shatters Liechtenstein's hope of maintaining their Austrian friends. Within a few months Napoleon is building the Confederation of the Rhine. This is an agreement among a bunch of conquered/nervous German princes to provide taxes and troops for Napoleon's future conquests. But in order to get the princes to sign up, a process called *German mediatization* was conducted in which various states were merged and properties handed over. In short, \"Ok, I'll join your confederation, but only if you declare my neighbor's house to be part of my house and you give me all their stuff.\"\n\nMaximilian I of Bavaria wanted to mediatize Liechtenstein as part of his deal to sign up for the Confederation, but Napoleon refused. The reason was because Johann von Liechtenstein---who was part of the negotiations back at the Treaty of Pressburg---really impressed Napoleon. So, Lichtenstein got be a co-founder of the Confederation and maintain their sovereignty.\n\nThe Confederation collapsed within a decade because Napoleon stopped winning all the time. And technically the French occupied the country for a minute there, but again because Johann and Napoleon were buddies it still operated pretty independently. \n\nNext up, Lichtenstein joins the new German Confederation until that starts to fall apart in the 1860s. The country gets a new constitution with some representative democracy, and officially declares itself permanently neutral. \n\nSo what about the 20th century? The Austrian ties do create problems during World War I, and the Allies impose an embargo. Lichtenstein forms a monetary alliance with the ever-neutral Swiss to stay afloat. After the war, they sign a treaty with the Swiss to let them handle tons of their diplomatic needs elsewhere.\n\nIn World War II, Liechtenstein's alliances also come in handy. They remain neutral, even when the dynasty's hereditary lands over in central Europe get claimed by Czechoslovakia and Poland as they are reclaiming territory from the retreating German army. Liechtenstein also gave asylum to about five hundred German-allied Russian soldiers in 1945. They got them permanently resettled in South America. For a country that was struggling to feed its own, this was considered a great sacrifice. Other German-allied Russian soldiers that were granted asylum elsewhere in the world were repatriated to the USSR, and often executed.\n\nNo neutral country in World War II got consumed into a larger country, but Liechtenstein wasn't even able to join the UN. That's because there was a fear that the Soviet Union would pressure small states to leverage their votes. This may have further helped secure their identity as an independent actor for the rest of the 20th century.\n\n**Not Being a Belligerent.**\n\nYou asked \"how did such a tiny nation not become totally absorbed and assimilated into the fold of a larger nation?\" The answer is that it basically did. Geopolitically, Lichtenstein is pretty much Switzerland. Culturally, it's pretty much Austria. Most of the Lichtenstein's history it avoided being consumed by another Germanic state by participating in confederations. Then it declared itself neutral, and managed to maintain that into the 20th century. \n\nOther modern micronations or would-be micronations have tended to get involved or traded about in conflicts. Andorra fought with the Moors, got passed around among various French, Catalan, and religious rulers, declared war on Germany in World War I, and got occupied by the French following unrest in their 1933 elections. In the Low Countries, only one of the Seventeen Provinces (Luxembourg) survives as its own country today. The rest variously split off to form the Dutch Republic, were divided up by feuding families, or became part of the kickoff for the Eighty Year's War. Most of the US Territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virigin Islands, Wake Island, etc.) were the results of conquests or land swaps or just purchases for the strategic military advantage.\n\n**The TL;DR Summary**\n\nLichtenstein avoided becoming the name of a province in Austria because they got a late start being defined as a country by that name, because Johann I impressed Napoleon, because the confederations they joined held up long enough to keep them from getting conquered, and because they decided to stop picking sides well before the start of the 20th century. \n\nP.S. I'm tempted to rewrite this entire post in a James Burke style \"Because Johann was a smooth operator\" but you'll just have to imagine that.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nSources: \n\nSecrets of the Seven Smallest States of Europe: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City, by Thomas M.

                "answer": "<p>This was actually the subject of my last master thesis stub (specifically the question why Liechtenstein remained a sovereign state). I want to add some things to the already excellent explanation by u/Robbyslaughter. Sorry for my terrible English.\n\nThere actually were a lot of countries questioning the Liechtenstein independence/sovereignty shortly after World War I. By 1919/1920 Liechtenstein tried to join the League of Nations. The small size of the country wasn\u2019t a problem, but the narrow bonds with Austria (till WW I) and later Switzerland were seen as a reason to reject Liechtenstein\u2019s application. (which was somewhat strange since \u201ccountries\u201d like British India and Belarus (then part of the Sovjet Union) were accepted before.\n\nIn my opinion the main reason Liechtenstein is still an independent nation (and more sovereign than the other micro states (I will come back on that)) is it\u2019s royal family. There were more threats to Liechtenstein\u2019s sovereignty after the Bavarians tried to annex the country. \n\n**Papal Liechtenstein?**\n\nDuring World War I there was actually a plan to make the pope sovereign monarch over Liechtenstein. A German politician (Matthias Erzberger, later a minister during the Weimar regime) proposed it and the top of the Roman Curia (including pope Benedict XV) was quite enthusiast about the idea. Since the Papal State was annexed into the Italian state, the pope was a \u201cprisoner\u201d in Rome; he had no territory. Due to that, he couldn\u2019t be invited to the peace talks, if he was made sovereign over Liechtenstein that problem would go away. Therefore some countries (like Austria-Hungary) and the papal administration put some pressure on the royal family of Liechtenstein to give up its sovereignty over the country and trade it in for a high title equivalent of a cardinal and the head of the Liechtenstein royal family would be a permanent regent of the country. The crown prince rejected that offer. There were quite serious negotiations going on in 1916 but after the rejection by the crown prince the Curia stopped its attempts.\n\n**Annexed into Switzerland or a neutral Tirol buffer state?**\n\nShortly after the first world war, the British government had a serious plan for a neutral Tirol buffer state that would include Liechtenstein but the plans were terminated early on. After that there was a treat from Vorarlberg. Vorarlberg is the Austrian region that neighbors Liechtenstein, tucked in between Tirol and Switzerland. Economically and culturally the region has more ties to Switzerland than to Austria and in Sankt Gallen, Switzerland a small movement was formed propagandizing the annexation of the area into Switzerland. On November 3th 1918 the region declares itself independent, May 11th a referendum on the question whether the region should join Switzerland is hold and 80 percent of the population voted in favor of annexation. The allied victors of the first world war however didn\u2019t recognize the declaration nor the referendum and drawed the new Austrian borders with the inclusion of the Vorarlberg region, mainly due to French objections and a lack of enthusiasm from the Swiss. If Vorarlberg was annexed into Switzerland Liechtenstein would be completely enclosed by Switzerland and it wouldn\u2019t be unthinkable that in a later stage the country would be absolved in it too. (there still is an active secession movement in Vorarlberg)\n\n**But then came F\u00fcrst Hans-Adam II**\n\nThen we skip a few decades and end in the 1970s. Liechtenstein is mostly dependent on Switzerland economically as well as on foreign policy, since, due to several treaties with Switzerland, the country wasn\u2019t allowed to sign treaties with other nations unless Switzerland approved. But then came then Crown Prince Hans-Adam II. He was a controversial figure, not the political correct type. He spoke his mind and was considered by many to be blunt. In a controversial speech in 1970 he said Liechtenstein was in the backpack of other nations, first Austria, later Switzerland, for ages and couldn\u2019t really be considered a sovereign nation. He said like in the fairy tales a Prince should wake up Liechtenstein. (source: \u201cEinen F\u00fcrsten als Touristenattraktion?\u201d, Volksblatt (September 15th 1970))\n\nSince then the country slowely becaume more and more active on the world stage. When the country wanted to join the European Economic Area and Switzerland didn\u2019t, they broke the old treaty in which Liechtenstein wasn\u2019t allowed to have its own foreign policy. Since then it joined a lot of international organizations, conducted treaties with the largest countries in the world (including Russia and the USA) and became much more confident.\n\nBut now I stop writing since this piece is already becoming to long and I skipped lots of information. If you are interested I will write more. For example on the accidental \u201cSwiss invasions\u201d and \u201cbombings\u201d which were really interesting since the Swiss military were condemned by its own people for not respecting Liechtenstein sovereinity.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nMaximilian Liebmann, \u2018Der Pabst \u2013 F\u00fcrst von Liechtenstein: Ein Vorschlag zur L\u00f6sung der R\u00f6mischen Frage aus dem Jahre 1916\u2018, in: Jahrbuch des Historischen Vereins f\u00fcr das F\u00fcrstentum Liechtenstein 85 (1985), 229-250. \n \nDieter Petras, \u2018Die Vorarlberger Frage\u2018, in: Historia scribere 1 (2009), 583-606.  \n\nDavid Beattie, Liechtenstein: a modern history (Triesen 2012).\n\nMichael M.

                "answer": "<p>Rome is a really interesting case to look at medicine in the military, because it's an important time in history where battlefield medicine actually pushed civilian medicine forward rather than the other way around. (Clarification upon request: *overall*, not just in terms of emergency medicine and wound treatment--things like preventative health and even, it seems, social attitudes towards physicians).\n\nWe do have to be careful to distinguish time periods within \"ancient Rome.\" In *Man and Wound in the Ancient World,* Richard Gabriel points to a few key turning points in Roman history that spurred advances in medical treatment for soldiers, both during and outside of battle. This refers both to organization/personnel and to medical knowledge/skills.\n\nFor the Republican period as a whole, battle medicine seems to have been left up to individual people. John Scarborough points to influence from the Greek world that pushed Roman military commanders to hire and pay their own *personal* medical officers. How far down into the legion that care extended, had to depend on the individual commander. There are a lot of references in sources to soldiers treating themselves, but also to the occasional commander like Publius Scipio seeing to it that the physician treating his wounds also treated his soldiers'.\n\nA major jump forward comes before and during the Gallic Wars, so around the time of Caesar. Our good friend Cicero indicates that soldiers could probably expect a medic to come treat their wounds, which indicates a step forward in terms of organizational sophistication:\n\n> Moreover, we often see, when the wounded are carried off the field, the raw, untried soldier, though but slightly wounded, cries out most shamefully; but the more brave, experienced veteran only inquires for some one to dress his wounds\n\nIf this seems like a tangent, it's not quite: you'll notice Cicero's very classically Stoic perspective on gutting up, dealing with wounds, and carrying on. Would a *proper* Roman soldier let himself be stopped by a case of the sniffles?\n\nPerhaps not, but he didn't always have a choice! Julius Caesar himself indicates this in Gallic War, VI:\n\n> Sextius Baculus, who had led a principal century under Caesar (of whom we have made mention in previous engagements), **had been left an invalid in the garrison, and had now been five days without food.** He, distrusting his own safety and that of all, goes forth from his tent unarmed; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the matter is in the utmost danger; he snatches arms from those nearest, and stations himself at the gate.\n\n(ETA: See /u/TangosWithNapalm's remarks below for a [deeper analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ja310/if_i_were_a_sick_legionary_in_the_roman_army_come/dbfed37/) of this passage.)\n\nAt this period in time, disease among soldiers was hot on the consciousness of military commanders. Around then and through to the civil wars following Caesar's assassination, apparently diseases ravaged the ranks even more than usual. This helped push the next major innovation in Roman battlefield medicine: attention to the *prevention* of sickness.\n\nBy the full blossoming of the imperial period, especially in the first centuries CE, Roman military medicine was amazingly sophisticated for its day in terms of professionalization and official support, preventative health, and wound care--the sooner the better. Sanitation, exercise, and good diet were seen as vital to ensuring the most fit troops possible. Roy Davies even describes forts that had *indoor* exercise areas for maintaining fitness in bad weather. This focus on preventative medicine shows an emphasis on entering battle with the best, healthiest, fittest army possible. \n\nAnd when things went wrong, the Roman Empire was not about to throw away its valuables. One of the key planks of the newly professionalized military medical service was the inclusion of a hospital or convalescence area in military forts. We might see this as an institutionalization of what Caesar referenced: a place where sick or injured soldiers had *time* to heal, under professional direction, rather than being left to the chancey abilities (and existence...) of a local civilian population.\n\nSo while the Stoic underpinnings of the Roman worldview led to poetic proclamations and probably an underlying valuation on sucking it up, at least by the time of the Roman Empire, the military thought it best to go into battle with hearty and hale troops. Although *direct* references are scanty, and surely the line between \"sickness\" and \"health\" varied incredibly from person to person and needs-of-battle to needs-of-battle, there was definitely a point where Romans recognized it was better for everyone concerned to stay behind.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Vegetius wrote on this particular aspect of soldiers' health as part of his military treatise *De Re Militari*, which covered the importance of military logistics, including supply lines and ensuring that soldiers had access to clean drinking water.\n\nThere are several points in the text (Book II) at which Vegetius describes the manner in which officers can perform substitute duties for officers who may be sick in need of replacement, which implies that those officers would be removed from their duties in the event of illness, but this portion of the text refers specifically to the duty of specific ranks of officers, not common footsoldiers.  There's also specific portion in the text where Vegetius says that sick soldiers should be brought back to health with proper feeding under the care of doctors.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that *De Re Militari* is that it is mostly a prescriptive treatise by Vegetius articulating the manner in which the legion *ought* to be run, rather than a record dedicated to documenting how things were *actually* run at the time Vegetius was around to observe them.  In fact, according to the introduction of the 1940 reprint of Lieutenant John Clarke, *De Re Militari* \"was little used by the Romans for whom it was written.\"\n\nTo provide context for Vegetius' work, *De Re Militari* alludes to events that took place in 383 (the death of the Emperor Gratian), meaning it was written and published some time after, and this was a time at which the decline of the Roman Empire was already on the horizon, in the form of the civil war that led to Gratian's death, as well as invasions throughout the late 4th century (e.g. Germanic invasions in the 370's).  The first book of *Re De Militari* is essentially a call for military reform, meaning the things that Vegetius called for (access to clean drinking water for soldiers, proper medical care from doctors) were shouted amidst the death knells of the Roman Empire.  The document was intended to eulogize the Roman legion opining about its better years, but Vegetius can't be considered a primary source on the \"glory years\" of the Roman Empire during the first century more than 300 years before his treatise was published.\n\nTo also provide appropriate context for the author himself, *De Re Militari* is one of the few military \"manuals\" from the Roman Empire to have survived to the present day, but its value is questionable according to some historians; according to G.R. Watson in \"The Roman Soldier,\" Vegetius was \"neither a historian nor a soldier: his work is a compilation carelessly constructed from material of all ages, a congeries of inconsistencies,\" so there remains the question of how much of *Re De Militari* actually describes the Roman legion as it once functioned, as opposed to Vegetius' idealized image of it.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Looks like I am a little late to the party, however, I just answered a very similar question a few days ago, so [I will copy and paste it here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4obrjg/why_would_thomas_jefferson_write_in_and_founding/)\n\nSpecific question I answered: \"Why would Thomas Jefferson write in, and founding fathers put their signatures on, the 2nd amendment after Shays rebellion?\"\n\nThis is an incredible question and I'm very glad you asked.  Before I answer it, I'd like to briefly describe what Shay's Rebellion actually was:\n\n**Context:** \n\nShays' Rebellion was an armed uprising led by former Massachusetts Militiamen and Veterans of the American Revolution which took place between 1786 - 1787.  Daniel Shays led several thousand \"rebels\" to fight against the economic injustices that were facing farmers and agrarian peasants all across America.  These farmers were experiencing extreme poverty following the end of the Revolutionary War.  All across Massachusetts (and the rest of America) farmers saw their lands foreclosed on in unfair property seizers, and they wanted to fight back, which they did here.  They were also trying to fight taxes which were beginning to be levied against them.  They fought this in many ways, but among them was closing and obscuring roads so that government agents couldn't reach rural parts of the state.  Shays' Rebellion would ultimately be put down, but it startled the gentry who feared further uprisings throughout the United States. \n\nI also like to point out that the naming of this event is really interesting.  The people who did this, called themselves Regulators ( [modeling off of the North Carolina Regulators](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/542884.Breaking_Loose_Together) who also fought against economic injustices before the start of the American Revolution.).  The idea of Civilian Regulation was a popular idea that sought to end government corruption and stamp out the overwhelming power of the gentry.  They believed that if the government wasn't regulating itself on behalf of \"We the People\", then \"the People\" had the right to regulate, or take back the government -- to take it back and do what they believed was right.  They didn't see themselves as a rebellion, but rather the gentry labeled them as such in order to de-legitimize their cause.  The gentry didn't want to call these men \"militiamen\" or \"regulators\" for this reason (which they clearly were), but instead, branded them as \"rebels\" who needed to be stopped.  \n\nVeterans like Benjamin Lincoln would raise militias on their own and mounted their own assaults against the \"rebels.\" They call themselves the \"the Massachusetts Militia\" even though it was the former militias who they were fighting!  So as they begin to debate this on the national stage, especially in 1787 at the Constitutional convention, the gentry singled out Daniel Shay (even though there were actually many other leaders), and they said he was crazy and people were only following a demagogue.  They hailed The Massachusetts Militia as the victors and saviors and asserted that militias are what will save America in the future against such madness.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAlthough the Constitution was drawn up in 1787 and ratified in 1788, the Bill of Rights was not ratified until December of 1791 when the Bill of Rights was finally agreed upon.  Whether or not to include the Bill of Rights (and what to include inside it) was a matter of extreme contestation between the Founders and everything within it was deeply fought over.   \n\nWhen we look at the Second Amendment specifically, we should look at a few things before hand.  First, by the 1790s, other small rebellions had popped up all over the country.  Terry Bouton's article \"A Road Closed: Rural Insurgency in Post-Independence Pennsylvania\" (The Journal of American History, Vol. 87, No. 3 (Dec., 2000), pp. 855-887) masterfully explains the fighting and rebellion that took place in the rural countrysides of Pennsylvania that mirrored what had happened in Massachusetts with Shays' Rebellion.  Simply put, the gentry were terrified that they were losing control of rural America, and as a result they would not be able to seize foreclosed land and collect taxes, which they deeply wanted.  Empowering militias to be trained and carry firearms allowed the gentry to call up these men in times of need and suppress these rebellions that were taking place.  \n\nNow there was already precedent in existence for protecting militias and their rights to bear arms in many states. Multiple other bills of rights from other states had already protected a militia's right to bear arms (such as [Section 13](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/virginia_declaration_of_rights.html) of Virginia's Declaration of Rights) and many of these states were fighting to have the federal government protect this as well.  \n\nNow, look at the very wording of the [Second Amendment](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html).\n\n>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n\"A well regulated Militia\"  is the key phrase. They are referring to the militias led by people like Benjamin Lincoln and his Massachusetts Militia not Shays and his \"rebellion\".  The initial goal was to protect a state's right to call up arms against rebels, not to arm the masses.  The Founders feared that in some states (like Rhode Island) that were already being drastically controlled by the poor (rather than the gentry), that local governments would start being able to choose who could keep and bear arms, and that by creating the Second Amendment, the gentry would always have the ability to call up and arm militias in times of need. \n\n**Clarification:** I also need to stress that this question mentioned Jefferson by name, however he was not a signer of the Constitution, but did certify the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1792.\n\nTl;Dr: The second ammendement wasn't passed *in spite of* Shays' Rebellion, rather it was passed *because* of Shays' Rebellion.\n\n**EDIT: 1**\n\nWow, what a response from everyone!

                "answer": "<p>This is both an important question, and, as many other respondents have noted, also a thorny one.  While I appreciate the citation of Heller as a strong indication of modern interpretations of the history of the phrase \u201cwell-regulated militia\u201d as seen through legal eyes, both the controlling and dissenting opinions have found dissent.  Since much of the origin of that dissent falls outside of the historical realm (and long discussion of it would violate our 20 year rule), I\u2019d rather leave that for now and look to some historian\u2019s interpretations, and see if that helps illuminate your question.  \n\n(Apparently I was had typed this up this morning that comment may have been removed for that reason, so sorry if I am responding to a phantom post now)\n\nJust as a caveat, though: Clearly this is a question that has sharp divides, and the context of the way the question is framed today might itself be seen as ahistorical.\n\nAs noted above, there is a well-established concern that a militia stood in contrast to a Standing Army, which was seen as the \u201ctool of a tyrant.\u201d  But one of the ways to answer this question about the militia specifically is to examine the historical context of what constituted a militia (and here I am focusing on the period before the Revolution) versus what did not at the time, since colonials did react to armed citizens taking up \u201cdefense\u201d differently in different contexts.\n\nIn general, for a militia to be \u201cwell-regulated\u201d it would have to have been mustered out by colonial authority, specifically the colonial Governor.  Other groups that owned individual weapons and \u201cmustered out\u201d on their own \u2013 even if was regional and massively popular \u2013 were seen not as proper militias but as illegal actors or vigilantes.  On the eve of the American Revolution in South Carolina, there was a set of vigilante groups in the western backcountry that eschewed the courts and decided to muster themselves out and attack outlaw gangs.  This \u201cRegulator Conflict\u201d of 1767 was not seen as a proper use of militia but instead as a criminal activity, although people in the Western backcountry saw it as simply a necessity due to lack of governmental protection afforded to people by the governments along the coast.  (I should note that western backcountry uprisings and \u201ctaking law into their own hands\u201d is a subject worthy of an entirely other thread, one can go back to Bacon\u2019s Rebellion as an example.) The eerie parallel is that the regulator conflicts presaged some of the complaints American Revolutionaries would have after the implementation of smuggling offenses being tried in the military Vice-Admiralty Courts \u2013 there were too few courts, too far away, although in some ways the complaints were polar opposites \u2013 the backcountry decried the lack of convictions of criminals, whereas the Vice Admiralty Courts were seen as tools of oppression, placing colonials who (in the colonials minds) were doing minor civilian infractions being sent to military Tribunals.\n\nSo not every group of citizens arming themselves and engaging in \u201cdefense\u201d was seen as well-organized.  Also, some historians have argued there is evidence in the early Republic that the second amendment was not seen as an individual right.  I am specifically thinking of an essay in the collection edited by Saul Cornell, Whose Right to Bear Arms Did the Second Amendment Protect? \u2013 and I apologize as I do not have the book on hand and a quick google search didn\u2019t help me find the list of essays, but I\u2019ll come back later and append if there is interest \u2013 but one of the early essays in the book cited the example of George Washington\u2019s experience with the Whiskey Rebellion \u2013 not only, as mentioned in a previous response, drummed out the militia to deal with the uprising, but he also ordered disarmament of the Rebels.  Therefore, the author concluded, the second amendment was not was not intended to reach beyond the militia mustered by the government.  However, the point of that text was also to show other historians who had differing interpretations as well.  It\u2019s a good resource to examine some of the historiography of the debate.  One of the co-editors, Cornell, is famous for making an argument that the two legal methods of viewing the second amendment (individual or collective) are both not quite right, and there is a third view entirely.  Since I have not read his book on the matter \u2013 only an abstract and reviews \u2013 I cannot comment on its veracity, but as he is a rather esteemed scholar on this debate you may find it of interest as to how the framing of the debate today may be in and of itself flawed when we ask these questions.\n\nHowever, one needs caution.  I want to point out that some historical books need to be avoided.  I myself was influenced at one time by a book that was highly lauded but ended up being upended.  One of our great modern scandals involving the Bancroft Prize happened when in Emory professor Michael Bellesiles published Arming America, which tried to argue that the American value of gun ownership was more a locus of Pre-Civil War America and not a phenomena rooted in colonial, Revolutionary, or Early National America.  As a new Assistant Professor, I personally tailored some of my lectures around what was seen then as groundbreaking new scholarship.  As you might guess, it ended up that the book was an embarrassment \u2013 indeed, a lot of the evidence was simply fabricated \u2013 and it led to the Bancroft Prize being rescinded.  (I think this is the only time that has happened.)\n\nOne other area worthy of investigation is to recognize that the idea of what constitutes a militia evolves as well over time in America.  Since this goes beyond my period of expertise, and I am not specifically a military historian, I will let my colleagues tackle this if they wish, but I would point to the fact that Congress has defined the militia differently over time, and as pointed out in another response, the rise of the National Guard codified the militia in a way that was clearly different from colonial understandings.  You might wish to look at the The Efficiency in Militia Act of 1903 passed by congress to get one such example.\n\nOne last note:  Because of the politicization of the gun issue, the diminishing role of the militia in United States defense and the rise of the Professional (standing) Army has often been treated in a bubble.  But I would argue that you can see parallels in other American institutions as well, where previously services that were volunteer or privatized and sometimes scattershot begin to be seen as disorganized, unresponsive, or ill-equipped to handle the challenges of an expanding population and urbanization over time (and particularly by the late 19th and early 20th centuries) and that expanded roles for government organization and professionalization are called for:  The evolution of city watch and Sheriffs to the Robert Peel model of policing that is the foundation for much of our structure of modern police forces; there is a similar evolution from volunteer firefighters into modern professional Firefighters.  Since Police, Military, and Fire response all entail safety and all have had somewhat similar evolutions into professionalization and government institutionalization, looking at the way who is tasked to do these behaviors \u2013 and who is prohibited \u2013 may provide insight into how control over these institutions have evolved without stepping on the second amendment political landmine.\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Yes, the current consensus is that the Hanging Gardens existed. Or, we know at least that the Assyrian kings did build extravagant gardens and could devise very elaborate, technologically advanced watering systems, as described by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Philo of Byzantium. But, the classical and cuneiform sources provide many different, sometimes conflicting, details about the existence of various royal gardens. I'm personally a bit dubious whether there ever existed the ONE Hanging Gardens of Babylon: the classical literary traditions might be a conflation of a number of different stories about royal gardens in the East. But, Stephanie Dalley, a now retired assyriologist from Oxford University who has written [a book](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Mystery_of_the_Hanging_Garden_of_Bab.html?id=6IUivLRnGC0C&redir_esc=y) and various articles about the Gardens, has come up with a nice theory for the location of the Gardens that does reconcile the classical tradition somewhat with the archaeological evidence - although her theory does (and probably will) remain unproven.\n\nDalley thinks the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were located at the Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh. Her reason for thinking that the Gardens never actually existed at Babylon is that many generally reliable classical authors, who describe Babylon to some length and who should be interested in exactly this sort of marvels, such as Herodotus (I.181), Xenophon (in *Cyropaedia*), or Pliny the Elder (*Nat. Hist.* VI. 123) never mention any gardens - even though they do describe the magnificent walls of the city. And, even more seriously, archaeological finds or cuneiform sources in Babylon give no signs of the Gardens. Notably, king Nebuchadnezzar, to whom the wonder was attributed by classical authors, says nothing about any gardens in the abundant inscriptions that record his building-works in the city. The famous classical descriptions of the gardens, from which we know them, come from:   \n\n1. Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC), an engineer who wrote technical treatises, described the watering system of the gardens to some length; but we do not know what is his source.   \n2. Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC, 10.1-6) quoting Ctesias of Cnidus, a c. 400 BC historian of Persia and Assyria; Ctesius\u2019 works are lost but he\u2019s generally considered a somewhat unreliable source.    \n3. The geographer Strabo (1st century AD, XVI 1.5), who according to his own words based his account of Persia in e.g. written eyewitness stories of the officers of Alexander the Great. It\u2019s not clear who is his source for the Garden of Babylon.  \n4. The Jewish author Josephus (1st century AD, *Contr. Apion.* I 19-20; *Antiquities of the Jews* X 11.1), saying that he has based his knowledge on Berossus, a Babylonian priest who apparently wrote history in Greek in 3rd century BC; Josephus\u2019 account is thus often considered the most legit     \n5. Quintus Curtius Rufus (1st century AD, *History of Alexander* V 1.35), who\u2019s description of the garden is thought to rely on Clitarchus, a late 4th century BC historian who compiled his own *History of Alexander* from contemporary eye-witness sources.  \n\nThere is an extremely handy [website](http://www.plinia.net/wonders/gardens/hg22.html) that has collected together all the classical sources in English translation. So, the thing to note here is that none of these people writing about the Garden of \u2019Babylon\u2019 had ever visited Babylon, not to mention Persia, expect perhaps Philo, of whose life we know nothing. And, they\u2019re writing about the old history and geography of a distant region, the languages of which they could not themselves speak; it\u2019s a game of Chinese whispers in Greek, Aramaic, Old Persian, and cuneiform\u2026 Classical authors regularly conflate or are mislead by their indigenous sources and get details about both the Persian past and present wrong. For example, Josephus attributed the Gardens to Nebuchadnezzar, but he was also the most famous ancient Mesopotamian king known in classical antiquity who just becomes a short-hand for \u201dfamous Eastern king who did lots of stuff\u201d: quite a number of things that he never historically did get attributed to him in classical tradition. The Greeks also understood the history of Mesopotamia within a faulty framework of three successive monarchies, Assyria, Media, and Persia, completely omitting the Neo-Babylonian kingdom (which Nebuchadnezzar ruled), so they often keep getting names and successive rules of Eastern monarchs wrong. The Greek and Jewish tradition weren\u2019t very good at keeping track of names of Eastern cities: they specifically mix up Nineveh and Babylon, something that also happens in the Biblical texts (e.g. II Chronicles 33:11 says that Assyrians took Manasseh captive to Babylon, which was at the time a ruin; it ought to say Nineveh).\n\nSo, it\u2019s not difficult to accept that the classical tradition just got the location of the Gardens wrong. Dalley then further goes onto identify Nineveh as the location of the Gardens and the king of Assyria Sennacherib (705 BC to 681 BC) as their builder. One of the main reasons for this is that Sennacherib describes at length in his records that he commissioned engineering works to bring mountain water to Nineveh, in order to provide water for drinking and for a garden that he had built. There\u2019s also an architectural relief in Nineveh by Sennacherib\u2019s grandson Assurbanibal, which shows a lavish garden: [picture of the sculpture](http://cdn.biblicalarchaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/nineveh-garden.jpg), and here\u2019s a [drawing](http://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/fileadmin/buh_bibelmodul/media/wibi/image/sw_WILAT_Paradies_2.jpg)where it\u2019s a bit easier to see what\u2019s going on. \n\nSennacherib's garden has for long been considered as a sort of \u2019proto-type\u2019 of the Hanging Gardens, but Dalley thinks we should in fact consider them as *the* Hanging Gardens. We should note that the Greek description for \u2019hanging\u2019 gardens does not imply the same as the English, i.e. plants with their roots higher than the actual leaves and top. A close reading of the sources could indeed support a garden like the one described in the sculpture relief: a naturalistic landscape rising up in tiers \"like a (Greek) theatre\" (Diodorus Siculus): forest trees are planted in it in terraced levels, and water is brought into the garden along an aqueduct which is incorporated into the terracing. There\u2019s also a decorative pavilion or small palace in the relief, which might correspond to the \"royal lodges of every description\" which Diodorus mentioned. The only issue is that there\u2019s no devices of raising water in huge quantities to the garden, just how \u201dstreams of water emerging from elevated sources flow partly in a straight line down sloping channels\u201d (Philo). But, the relief is broken in the middle, and it\u2019s possible that the picture did show some water-raising device, too.\n\nSo, [here\u2019s](http://imgur.com/a/MN5dc) artist Terry Ball\u2019s picture of the \u2019Hanging Gardens of Babylon\u2019 based on Dalley\u2019s instructions and the Nineveh relief. \n\nDalley further backs up her argument by noting that Sennacherib conquered and destroyed Babylon to shambles during his rule, rendering the city completely deserted for some seven years; so, technically he was the \u2019king of Babylon\u2019. And, Dalley thinks there might be some evidence that during this time Nineveh as Sennacherib\u2019s capital was considered as \u2019New Babylon\u2019, further explaining the later confusion. This is possible, but all this is bit shaky proof for Nineveh as the definite location for the Gardens. The Nineveh theory is mainly based on that sculptural relief, and it\u2019s easy to make the literary descriptions and the very scarce historical evidence we have to fit the picture when we want to make it happen, considering how much room for speculation there is. Her theory is lovely and certainly works, but we should note that there were other lavish gardens in Mesopotamia that might have just as well been the source of the classical tradition; the kings quite liked bragging about gardens and engineering works in public inscriptions. For example, the banquet stela of Assurnasirpal II from Nimrud described his engineering works that brought mountain water to his garden at Nimrud, and the huge party he held when the work was completed, entertaining more than 69,000 people with extravaganza. \n\nTL;DR: Some gardens definitely did exist in Mesopotamia; to what extent they were THE Gardens of Babylon, is open to interpretation. \n\nE: typos, and the link to ancient sources fixed\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The two things to consider here are the Soviet dominance of human intelligence and a far superior Soviet counterintelligence units. So I will answer in two parts.\n\nSoviet human intelligence vastly outpaced the CIA during the early to mid Cold War. The Soviet Union recruited young, ideologically motivated, foreign nationals (those in target states) with a high potential to reach important government positions. When many of these agents reached those positions it became clear that the CIA, MI5, and MI6 were not even under siege but instead had already become thoroughly penetrated. Author Wilderness of Mirrors, David C Martin says that \"[the CIA] was utterly ignorant of Soviet espionage operations.\" Agents in the employ of the Soviet Union often installed themselves in the organization's core structure before rigorous internal counterintelligence programs were instituted. This means that the infiltrators were trusted members of the team and with this status that effectively exempted them from scrutiny, the Soviet Union knew of the vast majority of high profile intelligence operations against them before they could even leave the planning board. A good example of this is Operation Gold, a plan to dig a tunnel underneath East Berlin in order to tap regional Soviet military cables. But before the tunnel was even made, a man named George Blake compromised the operation, effectively opening up the plan and the agencies behind it to manipulation through misinformation. It is my view that the CIA was only kept in the game by strong counterintelligence agents like James Jesus Angleton and William King Harvey, but mostly Soviet walk-ins or defectors. Many of the CIA's counterintelligence victories were achieved through defectors like Walter Krivitsky and Michael Goleniewski.\n\nIn terms of counterintelligence programs, the early Soviet model was also far superior. Naturally, secret police, surveillance, and counterintelligence all come easily with a totalitarian, autocratic government. This enabled Red Army units like SMERSH (a name that amounts to \"Death to spies\" in Russian) to have free reign in convicting and killing spies as they were created as an external organ to existing Soviet military/intelligence structure. They were so effective because they targeted any threat to information security, both real and imaginary which resulted in the executions of many innocents.\n\nSo, as a brief answer to your question: during the early Cold War, the balance of power in intelligence (and counterintelligence) heavily favored the Soviets.\n\nSources:\nVadim Birstein's SMERSH,\nDavid C. Martin's Wilderness of Mirrors,\nMichael Warner's The Rise and Fall of Intelligence\n</p>",

Members of the colonial gentry ate meals quiet a bit more lavished than your average person.   A great example of this (because the sources still exist) is George Washington's Mount Vernon. \n\nBreakfast was usually served around 7:00AM and prepared by slaves and usually summoned by a bell. [The diary of Benjamin Latrope, who visited the estate in 1796 gave us some interesting insight into what the Washington's served their guests for breakfast](http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/dining-at-mount-vernon/). Breakfast consisted of tea, coffee, and a variety of meats (some even served cold). Other visitors also had breakfasts which heavily favored meat, including ham, cold corned beef, red herring, and cold mutton.  They also were usually accompanied by fresh vegetables. \n\nStrange as it may seem, chocolate was also sometimes served for breakfast, but usually just when guests arrived.  Washington desired to be a very generous host to his guests.   His accounting books also give us a lot of insight. In 1785, Washington outlined that he's been receiving hundreds of visitors a year and that he feels compelled to honor them with his hospitality.  This included paying for all their meals, which was very expensive.  In this year, he paid for 584 breakfasts (and 757 dinners!).  Hog meat was the meat most used during this year, which they used 16,000 pound of it just for guests -- and none of these figures include his own family members of the cost of feeding the servants and slaves of his guests.\n\nedit: spelling</p>",

On the other hand, the first documented use of \"shit!\" an an interjection is much later (1865), but keep in mind that profanity was rarely printed - in fact, the earliest three quotations in the OED are from official Army, congressional, and legal proceedings, which were required to reproduce exactly what was said, even if it was otherwise considered \"unprintable.\" In any case, the word would have likely been in use during the events of The Revenant.\n\n\"Fuck\" is similarly venerable; its use as a verb dates back at least to the 16th century. It doesn't appear as an interjection in written sources until 1929, but again, the fact that printing swears was a taboo until the 20th century (Joyce's *Ulysses*, for example, was the subject of a famous obscenity case) means that the word, in its modern sense, was probably already in use for some time before anyone wrote it down.</p>",

Many of which have origins as old as English and the others were once not vulgar words that gained increasingly vulgar meanings--if I say to you the words \"balls\", \"cock\", \"jugs\" you might think of merely the obscene meanings rather than round objects, rooster, pitchers.  Likewise, words like \"crap\" and \"bitch\" had non-obscene origins that became obscene over time (because people in those times, gasp, used them obscenely with such regularity that their obscene meanings over powered their conventional meanings).  It's somewhat difficult to know exactly which people swore, and how much, and in front of whom historically because those are exactly the kind of things that are not likely to be written down in noble prose--unfortunately, we don't have a 19th century \"urban dictionary\" nor 19th century internet forums to gage how often and in which contexts people habitually swore.  In novels and the like, there's a tremendous amount of censorship--self-censorship, of course, but also more formalized censorship.  This most famous form of 19th century censorship was \"[bowdlerization](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bowdlerize)\", where even Shakespeare was censored to remove the naughty bits.   \"[Banned in Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banned_in_Boston)\" was the watchword.  \n\nAs for fiction, the four Italian anarchist writers behind the novel [*Q*](http://www.amazon.com/Q-Luther-Blissett/dp/0156031965), an adventure mystery set during the Protestant Reformation, I think put it best in a [little essay they wrote in response to complaints about the \"anachronistic\" language they used in the novel](http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/giap/giapdigest25.html):\n\n>In the past ten months, since our first novel was published in English, some reviewers have complained about the allegedly \"anachronistic\" language we used in the book. As a matter of fact, any novel that's written nowadays but is set in a fairly remote past is to be penned in a more or less \"anachronistic\" language, at least if the author wants people to read it [...]\n\n>However, those reviewers are not talking about that. They're talking about profanity. They're talking about foul language. Although they use the term \"anachronisms\", obscene utterances is what they really mean. There were complaints about \"the wealth of f\\*\\*k's and 's\\*\\*t's\" in the novel.   [...]\n\n>Human beings always cursed and swore, they did it in all ages, always by referring to catabolism, rough sex and the genitals. In Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Rumanian etc.) we still use the Latin words, e.g. \"merda\" [shit] and \"culum\" [ass].  As far as the history of the Italian language goes, one of the earliest written sentences in Vulgar (ancient Italian) is \"Fili de le pute traite\" [Pull, you sons of whores!], which appears on a Twelfth Century fresco in a Roman church. \n\nThe essay has a small image of the fresco (it's in the Basilica of San Clemente), but [here's a bigger one](http://roma.andreapollett.com/S2/ROMA-C37.JPG)--the man on the far right is the one doing the cussing in \"Vulgar\".  For reference, the modern forms of those words in those languages are *merda, merde, mierda, merda, [rahat]* and *culo, cul, culo, cu, cur*, respectively. \n\nFor more on the actual origins of the English swearwords (plus a few select favorites from other languages), again, [check out my little piece linked at the top](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/298omb/friday_freeforall_june_27_2014/ciioq5j?context=1).  It's one of my favorite things I've ever put on Reddit.  But, all that said, while it's very clear that people swore in the 19th century, it's very difficult to say how much because it simply wasn't written down.  We can guess that probably men swore more than women, probably lower class men more than refined men, probably men among men more than in mixed company, etc. but with the evidence we have, it's very difficult to say who exactly swore and exactly how much and in which circumstances.  But we can say they definitely swore, and some of them certainly swore like sailors, and you can tell your mother we have been saying \"shit\" and \"fuck\" since before the Angles and the Saxons invaded England and became the Anglo-Saxons--just compare shit to Scheisse and fuck to ficken and you'll see how truly ancient these words are.  </p>",

As such, I'll repost that old answer here for you (with a bit of cleanup)!\n\nDuring World War II, the Swiss were neutral and generally speaking maintained that position, meaning that they did not declare war or offer military assistance to either power, and while they traded, even in goods that had military purposes, they did not openly favor one side over the other (which would have given them \"non-belligerent\" status, such as in the case of Sweden and Finland in 1939-1940, although I would note that isn't so much a proper term as Neutral). But, that isn't to say they did nothing. The Swiss practiced armed neutrality, meaning they mobilized for possible (defensive) war, and in conducting their trade, courted several controversies. Germany certainly loomed as a threat in some respects, and they considered whether or not to invade, but in the end, it there is little evidence to suggest such an action was imminent, and plenty to point to the idea that Germany was better off with a free, but cooperative Switzerland than one they controlled but had suffered the ravages of war. Anyways though...\n\n**Call Up**\n\nWhen war broke out on September 1st, Switzerland mobilized quicker than the Allied powers. Over 400,000 men of the militia-based Swiss Army had reported to their post within 48 hours of Germany crossing the Polish border, quicker than either France or the UK! This meant that roughly 10 percent of the country was now under arms, and an additional 500,000 or so men and women were in auxiliary organizations such as the FHD, or otherwise in a job that gave direct assistance to the military.\n\nThe Swiss military is quite famous for how they are organized around mandatory service, and at the time of World War II, the professional core of the military was tiny - made up mostly of border guards, pilots, and a small cadre of staff officers who kept things running. For the general population, marksmanship was encouraged and cultivated for boys, and when they reached the age of 20, they had a three-month basic training course and were issued a uniform and a rifle - [A K31 straight-pull rifle](http://candrsenal.com/rifle-swiss-karabiner-1931/) by that point, although older reservists would possibly have a Schmidt-Rubin K11. They now were in the active reserve (\"Miliz\") until the age of 48, which required that they took a three-week refresher course every year, after which they \"retired\" to the inactive reserve (Meaning they weren't going to be immediately called up, and didn't need to do the refresher, but still expected to in time of great need). Especially talented individuals could be nominated for the advanced course in alpine warfare, which was another three months, and would allow them to join the elite Mountain Brigades. With the mass call up in 1939 though, the retirement age was temporarily pushed back to 60, and new inductees now underwent a four month course, and those who had been called up began training on a full time basis.\n\nAside from the nation-in-arms model, the Swiss also had built their country to brace for the worst. Bridges, railways, tunnels, and other infrastructure were made for easy mining, and roads had pre-built holes for the placement of anti-tank stakes. In the event of invasion, 100,000 border troops were to fight a delaying action, blowing up everything they could as they fell back, while civilians were evacuated southwards, and the bulk of the Swiss forces moved into the highly defensible National Redoubt high in the Alps, where Swiss planners believed they could hold off German attacks indefinitely. The plan would of course mean turning over much of the country to the invader, and laying waste to it as well - denying use of infrastructure by the occupier, but also crippling the Swiss themselves were they to retake the land - but at least, they hoped, they could cost whoever chose to violate their neutrality dearly.\n\n**1940**\n\nFor the first few months, very little happened, not just in Switzerland, but on the Franco-German frontier as well - a period known as the \"Phony War\", or the \"Sitzkrieg\". But that didn't mean that Switzerland was twiddling their collective thumbs. The greatest fear at that point was of a violation of the Swiss border for a southern sweep into France around the Maginot Line. The geography of the Alps might protect the 'heart of Switzerland' from a direct invasion, to a degree, but the \"Swiss Plateau\" is considerably more usable for military operations, especially if your end goal is entering France. When the Germans in fact launched *Fall Gelb* through the Low Countries to the North instead, Switzerland hardly breathed a sigh of relief. Intelligence that they had collected pointed to a German plan to launch a complimentary attack just as they had feared, to be initiated on May 15th. Nothing came to pass of this. There had been some build up, but it was just an exercise, although the purpose may have been to make the French *think* that was the intent so as to divert forces south.\n\nAs we all know, France fell quickly. The immediate effect of this was a massive influx of soldiers in flight. About 30,000 Frenchmen crossed the border and laid down their arms. They would be interned by the Swiss for a few months, until an agreement was reached for their repatriation to France in early 1941. 13,000 Polish soldiers also ended up there, having been serving in France, but they were not repatriated during the war, and instead interned for the duration at several camps. They were utilized for various labor projects such as draining swampland for farming, and after the war most either returned to Poland, or left for some other country, but roughly 1,000 chose to settle in Switzerland.\n\nIt wasn't just soldiers though. Thousands upon thousands of refugees, including French Jews, also were making their way to the border. Fearful of being overloaded, very strict quotas were set, and entry was refused to many with the infamous explanation that the \"lifeboat is full\". 7,000 Jews had already been given entry prior to the war, and not many more were initially to be allowed. The sight of several committing suicide when refused entry caused many guards to start turning a blind eye, and eventually there was some liberalization to the refugee policy, but it nevertheless fell very short. While roughly 20,000 Jewish persons were included in the several hundred thousand refugees and internees who found shelter in Switzerland, about an equal number were turned away at the border. While the Swiss plead that their small country could only handle so many refugees, many both at the time and in decades since assert that a significantly higher number could have been reasonably accommodated (As well as criticizing the treatment of those who were allowed in. The Swiss billed them for room and board, which was deducted from any money that had brought into the country - which the Swiss had made them turn over for \"safe keeping\". If they couldn't pay, the Swiss later sent bills to the governments of France and Belgium and the Netherlands for the cost after the war).\n\nMore so though, the completion of the German invasion of France meant that the immediate threat of invasion was lessened. For some, including President Pilet-Golaz, this meant *Erneuerung* and *Anpassung* (Renewal and adaptation), or that is to say, coming to terms with the new European order and attempting to find Switzerland's place in it. One of the first steps towards this was to demobilize 2/3 of the Swiss Army on Pilet-Golaz's orders, with little secret that it was in order to not antagonize Germany needlessly. It isn't at all a stretch to call the decision controversial. There wasn't much outright Nazi sympathies in Switzerland, and while many might have understood the pragmatic requirements given Switzerland's location, sympathies were generally with the Allies. As a popular saying went, \"we work for the Germans six days a week, and pray for the Allies on the seventh.\" As such, the move went against the Swiss self-image and hurt Swiss morale, even if they were somewhat in denial.\n\nThe worst hit in the morale department were the Army. In reaction, General Guisan brought 650 Swiss officers to Lake Lucerne, where the old Confederacy had been founded, and gave them a stirring speech about absolute resistance to any invasion, and had them all swear oaths to fight to the end if it happened. It was a great piece of political theater if nothing else, and a major boost to restore Swiss confidence. But again, as I note... the Swiss were a bit in denial.\n\nPart II incoming\n\nEdit: Few tune-ups</p>",

Victoria was the only child of King George III's fourth born son, her three uncles, George IV, Prince Frederick, and William IV all died leaving no legitimate children. Victoria's father, Prince Edward had died in 1820, 17 years before Victoria became Queen.\n\nWhen Victoria did succeed her uncle she was unmarried and, to make matters worse, owing to the laws governing the German titles that had been in her family since George I 1714, all the Hanoverian titles went to her fairly unpopular uncle, the fifth son of George III, [Ernest Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Augustus_I_of_Hanover) creating a new German royal family. If there were any monarch of the last 300 years that would have faced massive opposition upon succession, it would have been Victoria, but even she was enormously popular in her early reign.\n\nThe thing about the (modern) Monarchy is only most legitimate choice succeeds the throne. There may well have been those concerned about Victoria becoming Queen, but what other options did they have? The only viable potential candidate left was the elderly Ernest Augustus, whose track record of [conservatism and political agitation](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ernest-Augustus-king-of-Hanover) left a lot of people, including the Duke of Wellington, with a very low opinion of him.\n\nCompare that to the succession of Elizabeth after the death of her father, George VI* in 1952. Her father, the second born son of George V, was not expected to succeed the throne, but after his elder brother abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson in 1936, he became King. George VI was a very popular king, and his prioritizing of his family meant they became very popular too. Whereas before the focus had been more on the King himself, George VI brought his family in to share the spotlight. As a result of this loosening of royal protocol, the royal family became much more like the one we see today, often photographed in more [informal situations](http://st3.cricketcountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Princess-Elizabeth-the-future-Queen-Elizabeth-II-conversing-with-her-father-King-George-VI-1895-1952-in-a-garden.jpg), compared with the ultra-formal attitude of his father, [George V](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5499/11682897433_35d0c8c600_b.jpg). You also probably know that the Royal family [remained in Buckingham Palace during WWII despite the Blitz](http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHouseofWindsor/GeorgeVI.aspx) and often [visited bombed areas in South London,](http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/70075.jpg) further boosting their popularity. [Princess Elizabeth also trained as an ambulance driver and quasi-mechanic](http://www.express.co.uk/pictures/galleries/2955/Queen-Elizabeth-II-World-War-II-pictures/Queen-Elizabeth-II-driving-an-ambulance-during-her-wartime-service-in-the-Auxiliary-Territorial-Service-on-10th-April-1945-65562) during the war, boosting her image enormously. \n\nAfter the War, Elizabeth went on to marry Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten in 1947. Philip was the former Prince of Greece and nephew of one of the most distinguished commanders during WWII, the former chief of Combined Operations, the former Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia, and last Viceroy of India, [Lord Louis Mountbatten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma), himself a grandson of Queen Victoria. Not only was the match a very well made one, but it came during a time of massive post-war austerity. Rationing was still enforced, and the genera mood of the country was depressed. The Royal marriage, as it so often does, provided a welcome distraction and a reason for people all over the Empire to celebrate.\n\nBy the time George VI died in early 1952, the Royal family was about as popular as they could be. When it came time for Elizabeth to ascend the throne the public had a little over 15 years of knowing she would succeed her father, so it was not as jarring as perhaps Victoria's was. She was the daughter of a very popular king, and a very popular Princess in her own right. She had a good husband, and two children of her own, Prince Charles and Princess Anne**. Again, the question must be asked, what alternative was there? The only other close claimant to the throne was her younger sister, Princess Margaret. George VI's younger brother, [Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Henry,_Duke_of_Gloucester) remained, but he had always been a private man, preferring the soldiers life to one in the limelight.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nBy the time Princess Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth, the Royal family was incredibly popular, she had a good husband, and the country had been prepared for her ascension for over 15 years.  \n\n*EDIT: From George IV to George VI.\n\n\n**EDIT: Previously referred to as Anne, Princess Royal. She wasn't known as the Princess Royal until 1987.</p>",

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, \"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II#Reign_.281952.E2.80.93present.29\n\n\nIts also probably worth noting that at this point the British still had their Empire, Decolonisation was only just starting to happen and Britain was still a significant global power so people were optimistic about the future regardless of where you fell on the issue of Decolonisation.\n \n\n--------------------------------------------\nI couldn't really find anything at all that suggested their were significant worries about her ascension to the throne, though I have to admit I was relying on internet sources and finding anything of any kind of significance was difficult, like I was able to find out that they chose to retain the Windsor name but not why they did it.\n\nMaybe someone better read on royal history will be able to help but from what I could tell there was no real criticism or worries at the time of the coronation.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nEdit: [SirGuyGrand](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3k8amw/was_anybody_in_1952_worried_about_the_ascension/cuvq0qg), [The_Alaskan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3k8amw/was_anybody_in_1952_worried_about_the_ascension/cuvqodq) have both provided better written responses (that are also better researched) also [24carats](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3k8amw/was_anybody_in_1952_worried_about_the_ascension/cuvoy5f) provides some sources other members of the family were attempting to take control of the crown/more power.</p>",

He likely realized that future presidents would emulate his style of ruling and his approach to the balance of power, particularly when it came to the left vs right wing debate. This is also the reason why he often took advice from both Jefferson (a left-wing individual) and Hamilton (a right-wing one), and both of which were constantly trying to sway Washington to their side. \n\nBut I digress. Washington eventually decided that the best decision was to be less formal and regally dressed than a monarch, but moreso in both regard than the average citizen. **So, no, there was no enormous cultural \"barrier\" that separated you from the President as it would from, say, the Holy Roman Emperor, and you would indeed be permitted to speak with Washington.**\n\nHowever, George Washington stopped being president in 1797, and was succeeded by Adams; your question asks specifically for 1798. I cannot speak for Adams, however I am willing to assume that his approach was not particularly unlike Washington's, especially given that the White House remained open to the public for decades after that. \n\nIn fact, Lincoln even has a quote about the sheer number of citizens that came to visit him in the White House:\n\n\"For myself, I feel\u2014though the tax on my time is heavy\u2014that no hours of my day are better enjoyed than those which thus bring me again within the direct contact and atmosphere of the average of our whole people.\" (Source: www.whitehousehistory.org/abraham-lincolns-white-house )\n\nI hope this helps to answer your question.\n\nAnother source:\n\nwww.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-first-president/5-challenges-of-being-americas-first-president/</p>",

Buckley Jr., editor of the *National Review*, [wrote a lengthy and impassioned defense of Nixon](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9D0CEEDF123DE63ABC4851DFB3668388669EDE) in the May 20, 1973 issue of the *New York Times.* Buckley wrote that it was inappropriate to judge the president by normal standards, and in fact what he did was not out of line with the actions of previous presidents. \"The evolution of the Presidency slowly, but not less certainly, transformed the office and presented the republic with an unwritten qualification,\" Buckley wrote. \"It is this: You must not impeach and remove a President merely for the purpose of punishing him.\"\n\nThere was, of course, [ample response to Buckley](http://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/10/archives/letters-regicide-beating-raps-gorgeous-snob-william-f-buckley-jr.html). \n\nYou might consider that Nixon had a large base of support (after all, he was elected President twice, and if you consider 1960, was nearly elected three times) that gradually eroded as more information became published. The *New York Herald Tribune* had a fairly typical pro-Nixon editorial stance before it went out of business in 1966 (h/t /u/texum for the clarification), as did the *Manchester Union Leader*. As the scandals of Nixon's second term gained light (credit the *Washington Post* here for picking up on stories that others discounted or underplayed), Nixon's support began to erode. The conservative magazine *Ideas* (it folded in 1975) was one of the longer-lasting defenders, as was William Safire, Nixon's speechwriter (before an abrupt resignation), penned a book partially in defense of Nixon. \"I'm writing this book sympathetic, but not sycophantic,\" Safire said in 1973, [two years before the book was published in 1975](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E04E0D81739E136A05750C2A9649C946490D6CF). \n\nWhen Nixon's transcripts became public in 1974, even people like Buckley deserted him. Only the hardest of hardcore supporters stayed with Nixon, and with friends in the House and Senate saying that impeachment and conviction were likely, Nixon resigned.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Yes, absolutely.\n\nTo begin with, don't forget that the romanticized Western image of samurai as hyper honor focused warrior monk types is pure exoticism with no real historic backing. \n\nMore to the point, like with the knights of Europe, while there was an official ideal of honor it was more prescriptive than descriptive and when you have a large group of heavily armed men some are going to be scumbags.\n\nFurther, \"samurai\" simply meant \"person from the caste permitted to carry weapons\", towards the end of the Tokugawa period (1600-1868) a great many samurai class men had no real weapon training, a minimal pension from the government, and generally survived by running up debts which were nullified every few years by government edict. \n\nThe Seven Samurai takes place earlier, in the Sengoku period (aka the Warring States Period), at a time of chaos and general confusion.  There was no centralized government, no rule beyond what the local warlord decreed and could enforce, and samurai (again, meaning \"people who carried weapons\", not \"super highly trained and deeply honorable warrior monk types\") were thugs enforcing the will of their local warlord, which usually meant stealing whatever they could from the peasants and calling it taxes.\n\nOr, worse, they were ronin.  When a warlord was defeated his soldiers (samurai) often just wandered off and turned to banditry to survive. There's a lot of mythology and several stories involving deeply honorable ronin seeking adventure and vengeance for the people who betrayed their lords, but mostly in real life they were just armed and trained men who took whatever they could from the people least likely to fight back.\n\nYou might check out [State of War](https://www.amazon.com/State-War-Fourteenth-Century-Michigan-Monograph/dp/1929280238), it's more about the somewhat earlier times than the Sengoku period, but most of what it covers applies to the later periods as well.\n\nFor an interesting, often funny, first hand, primary source, account of daily life for a poor man of samurai class during the mid Tokugawa period check [Musui's Story](https://www.amazon.com/Musuis-Story-Autobiography-Tokugawa-Samurai/dp/0816512566), it's a very quick read, an autobiography written by Musui himself, who lived a quite disreputable life and busts a lot of myths of the noble honorable samurai.\n\nTL;DR: even at the best of times, samurai were just soldiers, and historically soldiers weren't what you'd call very nice.  In the worse times they were just bandits.  The idea of samurai as super honorable warriors is just a myth. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Oh yeah, there's plenty of legitimacy to this accusation. It might even be closer to the truth.\n\nWilliam Wayne Farris quotes Paul Varley in describing the samurai as \"extravagant, rambunctious, and lawless.\" Taken from *Japan to 1600*:\n\n>As social upstarts, samurai were \"extravagant, rambunctious, and lawless.\" Having no sense of good breeding, they gambled and spent all their time partying, drinking, and engaging loose women. Legislation promulgated in 1336 tried to curb such behavior, but to little avail. Born in 1306, Sasaki served first the Hojo and then Go-Daigo. In 1335, he switched sides again and adhered to Takauji. For his service, he was named a daimyo, and ironically, helped to write the vey law codes that he came to flout so freely.\nIn 1340, for example, when Sasaki was throwing one of his many parties, he and his followers admired some maple trees on an excursion, so much so that they ripped the branches off the trees. The garden happened to belong to a temple headed by the brother of a retired emperor, and his servants beat the branch gatherers. When Sasaki heard about the thrashing, he led three hundred mounted soldiers back to the temple and set it on fire. The priests demanded Sasaki's head, but the Ashikaga merely ordered him into exile. On the day when he left for distant parts, Sasaki placed three hundred members of his family and retainer band in an entourage showing off the latest in martial finery, including quivers covered in rabbit skin. They brought along quantities of sumptuous food and had courtesans waiting at every inn along the exile route. It became a pleasure excursion, not the punishment for a grave crime.\n\nWell that's just an example of a lawless samurai (and his equally lawless samurai retainers). What about pillaging, raping, and burning?\n\n>In particular, the armies provisioning techniques inflicted considerable hardship on the populace at large. Between 1335 and 1386 there were at least seventy-one incidents of arson and harvests stolen by armies in the field. In one particularly egregious case, in Mino in 1340, samurai \"attacked residences, stole the rice and other grain laid aside as seed, so that the peasants fled and there was no cultivation going on.\"\n\nThe above is from the Northern and Southern Courts period, but similar records exist back in the Genpei War and also the Sengoku. The term in Japanese for this kind of raiding of civilians is \u4e71\u59a8\u53d6\u308a (ranboudori) or \u4e71\u53d6\u308a (randori). Japanese lords (or really, lords all over the world at this point) simply did not have the ability to fully supply their armies, especially with food, and so allowed or even commanded their men to just take it from the countryside. The warriors pillaged, raped, burnt, and sold people into slavery.\n\nIn the Sengoku, at least part of the reason for many daimyos' expeditions was to prevent hungry and restless samurai from eating the daimyos' own food and pillaging their own domain, and instead profit from doing it to others. For example:\n\n>Pillage, arson, and rape took place from one end of the archipelago to the other. In western Honshu, the Mori left behind a legacy of glory arising from an annual cycle of devestation. Their armies plundered fields during the spring planting, mowed down wheat crops and interfered with farmers during the busy summer, stole the harvest in the fall, and broke into granaries, burned peasant homes, and left their victims to freeze or starve to death in the winter. At Hineno Estate in the Kinai, soldiers repeatedly burned residences, raped women, kidnapped and pressed unsuspecting cultivators into service, and pilfered peasants'personal belongings, tools, and livestock. Just west of the Kanto, Takeda Shingen was among the most creative in profiting from the war-capturing the enemy's women, children, and disabled and offering them for sale back to their relatives. Shingen's brand of war-profiteering shattered families and undoubtedly resulted in the death of many captives, even as it fed his war machine.\n\nEven my personal favourite Sengoku daimyo, Uesugi Kenshin, despite a reputation as one of the most honourable daimyos, did this. Fujiki Hisashi noted in *\u96d1\u5175\u305f\u3061\u306e\u6226\u5834 \u4e2d\u4e16\u306e\u50ad\u5175\u3068\u5974\u96b7\u72e9* (The Battlefield of Common Soldiers-Mercenaries and Slavers of the Middle Ages) that Kenshin's frequent eastward campaigns turned many places in Kanto into living hell. Just goes to show that, like the knights of Europe, whatever supposed honour the samurai had did not extend to commoners.\n\nKuroda Nagamasa ordered screens to be painted of the Siege/Battle of Osaka in 1615. [The screen depicting the aftermath of the fall of the castle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/The_Siege_of_Osaka_Castle2.jpg/1920px-The_Siege_of_Osaka_Castle2.jpg) shows the absolute chaos as the people tried to run and escape the absolute slaughter. Stephen Turnbull in his work on the Siege of Osaka quotes the letter of Richard Cocks:\n\n>Also we have had great troubles and wars in Japan since our arrival, which hath put us to much pains and charges in sending up and down to save our goods, and yet for all that some is lost and burned, two great cities being burned to the ground, each one of them being almost as big as London and not one house is left standing, the one called Osaka and the other Sakai; and, as is reported, above 300,000 men have lost their lives on the one part and other.\n\nThings were so bad that many villages and commoners came together in armed groups and fortified their villages to resist. At any point they could, they got back at the samurai, finding small bands and assaulting, killing them, called \u843d\u3061\u6b66\u8005\u72e9\u308a (ochimushagari). Even big names fell victim to these bands, most famously Akechi Mitsuhide getting killed on the retreat from his defeat at Yamazaki. Some villages and bands came together under the banner of Ikko buddhism, and some even grew to such sizes they kicked out the daimyos all together ruled their own domains.</p>",

Bushid\u014d is a relatively modern concept centuries removed from when samurai were actually involved in wars.\n\nBushido became a widely accepted idea in the Japanese national consciousness when a Japanese Quaker, with no background in history,named Inaz\u014d Nitobe wrote *Bushido: The Soul of Japan* (1899).  If you read the introduction it becomes apparent that he wrote the book out of a sense of inferiority to Western society and hoped to create an idea of something inherently Japanese that is of equal standing with the west.  He writes \"I have tried to illustrate whatever points I have made with parallel examples from European history and literature.\"  He then proceeds to create Bushid\u014d by choosing stories without any historical veracity or analysis of the historical context of these stories.  He then frames these stories in terms of Western philosophy and history. \n\nYou can see how flawed Inaz\u014d understanding of the history of the samurai is throughout the whole work.  One of my favorite chapters is \"The Sword the Soul of the Samurai\" in which he declares \"When Mahomet proclaimed that \"the sword is the key of Heaven and of Hell.\" he only echoed a Japanese sentiment.\"  Of course the problem with this is that the idea of the sword being the main weapon of the samurai only came about after the samurai had ended their wars and entered an era of relative peace during the 16th century.  When samurai basically became bureaucrats they increasingly focused on idealizing the symbol of their power, the sword that they alone were allowed to carry.  If you look at the first codes that Tokugawa laid down about samurai and the aristocracy, there is no mention of focusing on swords.  In fact, it mentions horse riding and archery as being important parts of being a samurai. \n\n</p>",

While not strictly speaking history, it is an ecological economics study of the history of the whale industry and the process of substitution. Bardi's conclusion is that the end of the whale industry was largely caused by depletion of the whale population which caused whalers to travel further and longer for less reliable catches and less about the birth of the oil industry. There's a few important take aways. \n\n- Peak whale was likely somewhere around 1849. By [1879 Starbuck notes that the whalers are finding catches more difficult and that longer voyages, longer cruise times and more expensive outfittings are the norm in his time](https://books.google.ca/books/about/History_of_the_American_Whale_Fishery.html?id=zGYRAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y). \n\n- Looking at inflation adjusted prices for whale products there are huge drops in prices between 1850 and 1860 (Graph on page 3). However, these drops are from all time price highs. The bottom of the price collapse in the mid-1870's is only slightly lower than the highest average yearly price for any year before 1850. As such the price doesn't so much collapse as it does rise as whale depletion starts to affect the price.\n\n- [Alcohol blends began to dominate the lighting oil market as early as 1830](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_alcohol_fuel). They were substantially cheaper than whale oil. Whale oil was a premium product which already had lower priced alternatives namely 'Camphene' (a mix of camphor, alcohol and turpentine), lard oil and coal oil. [Camphene was the leading lamp oil with something in the area of 200 million gallons per year while whale oil peaked at around 18 million gallons. ](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/this-post-is-hopelessly-long-w/). \"By the late 1830s, alcohol blends had replaced increasingly expensive whale oil in most parts of the country. It \u201ceasily took the lead as the illuminant\u201d because it was \u201ca decided improvement on other oils then in use,\u201d (especially lard oils) according to a lamp manufacturer\u2019s \u201cHistory of Light.\u201d  By 1860, thousands of distilleries churned out at least 90 million gallons of alcohol per year for lighting. 22   In the 1850s, camphene (at $.50 per gallon) was cheaper than whale oil ($1.30 to $2.50 per gallon) and lard oil (90 cents per gallon). It was about the same price as coal oil, which was the product first marketed as \u201ckerosene\u201d (literally \u201csun fuel\u201d).\" ( Kovarik, 1998)\n\n- Rock oil (kerosene) was only marketed as lamp oil in the 1860's 15 years after the peak in whaling in 1849. Kerosene was more of a direct competitor to Camphene than to whale oil in price and market niche. At this point there are no cost savings between camphene and kerosene as they are priced more or less the same. \n\n- In 1862 and 1864 a $2.08 tax on alcohol was implemented raising the price substantially. This raised the costs of Camphene just as the equivalently priced kerosene enters the market. \"The imposition of the internal-revenue tax on distilled spirits \u2026 increased the cost of this \u2018burning fluid\u2019 beyond the possibility of using it in competition with kerosene..,\u201d said Rufus F. Herrick, an engineer with the Edison Electric Testing Laboratory who wrote one of the first books on the use of alcohol fuel.\" (Kovarik, 1998)\n\n- \"the American alcohol tax meant that kerosene became the primary fuel virtually overnight, and the distilleries making lamp fuel lost their markets. The tax \u201chad the effect of upsetting [the distilleries] and in some cases destroying them,\u201d said IRS commissioner David A. Wells in 1872. \u201cThe manufacture of burning fluid for lighting suddenly ceased; happily, it was replaced by petroleum, which was about to be discovered.\u201d  Similarly, C.J. Zintheo, of the US Department of Agriculture, said that 90 million gallons of alcohol per year were used for lighting, cooking, and industry before the tax was imposed. Meanwhile, use of oil shot up from almost nothing in 1860 to over 200 million gallons in 1870. \u201cThe effect was disastrous to great industries, which, if [they were to be] saved from ruin, had to be rapidly revolutionized,\u201d according to Irish engineer Robert N. Tweedy. \" (Kovarik again)\n\nIn short the idea that kerosene replaced whale oil is something of a myth. Whaling largely collapsed due to depletion and over hunting. Whale oil was a premium product that was largely replaced by camphene and then kerosene and then the electric light not by kerosene directly. Kerosene enters the market in large part due to a political decision to tax one of it's competitors principle ingredients, alcohol. \n\nthe full cite for the camphene element is Bill Kovarik, Automotive History Review, Spring 1998, No. 32, p. 7 \u2013 27.

                "answer": "<p>The American whaling fleet began to decline before the transition to petroleum and the industry became less and less profitable throughout the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThe Civil War was a major hardship for the whaling fleet; the fleet contracted by about 50% during the war. The US Navy bought 24 whale ships (14 from New Bedford) and a merchant ship and in December 1861, sank them in Savannah harbor to blockade the city. 14 more whale ships and 6 more commercial ships were sunk at Charleston in January 1862. The Confederates also targeted whale ships in an effort to disrupt the Union economy (and because most of the important whaling centers were staunchly pro-Union). The CSS Alabama captured and burned 14 whale ships and the CSS Shenandoah destroyed 25 more. \n\nWhale oil faced competition in lighting as early as the 1840's from lard oil, created by rending pig fat, and camphene, a mixture of turpentine and alcohol. Camphene was cheaper than whale oil and burned brightly, but it was dangerous and there were many reports of the substance causing explosions and fires. The *Whalemen's Shipping List*, the most popular trade journal for the industry, advocated for the government to regulate camphene in order to help whale oil. Other papers mocked these competitors as burning too fast or smelling bad. Coal gas began to be used in many cities as well, including New Bedford starting in 1853. By the end of the 1850's, kerosene also became a serious competitor to whale oil. And after the discovery of oil in 1859, kerosene really took off because the production of kerosene from oil instead of coal allowed the supply to meet demand. To put the fight the whaling industry faced into perspective, the entire whale fleet produced 430,000 barrels of oil in 1847, its most productive year. The petroleum industry refined that much oil in its first year of production in 1860. By 1862, three million barrels of petroleum oil was produced compared to 155,000 barrels of whale oil. By 1870, the *Whalemen's Shipping List* wrote:\n\n> Our merchants do not look upon the future of whaling with encouragement, and seem disposed to distrust it as to its pecuniary results.\n\nIn 1871, many American whalers pushed north into the Arctic in pursuit of bowhead whales. An especially bad season of weather caught the fleet by surprise leading to many boats being caught in the ice and crushed. In total, 33 whale ships were lost, including 22 from New Bedford, and more than 1,200 people had to evacuate across the ice to awaiting rescue ships. The *New York Times* wrote of the incident:\n\n> It is reported from that city that the disaster is really almost as severe a blow to it as was the great fire to Chicago; it has prostrated its main business\u2014that of whaling\u2014and has seriously damaged, if not crippled, its leading insurance offices.\n\n12 more ships were lost in a similar disaster in 1876. By the late 1870's, the fleet had shrunk from a high of more than 700 ships to fewer than 200. Only about a dozen whaling ports were still operating. Whales became increasingly scarce from overfishing requiring longer and longer voyages. This increased costs, decreased profits, made it harder to find crews and made insuring the trips exceedingly difficult. Many of the leading whaling families were unwilling to send out ships without insurance and some began moving their capital out of whaling to industries such as textiles. \n\nIronically, the whaling industry was sustained into the early 20th century not so much by whale oil but by baleen. Baleen, a hard, bristle-like substance in some whales' mouths, was used in a variety of products, but especially in the hoops of women's skirts that became fashionable in the late 19th century. In 1870, baleen fetched 85 cents a pound but by 1904, it went for $5.80 a pound. Given that a large bowhead whale could have upwards of 3,000 pounds of baleen, whale bone became much more profitable than whale oil by the turn of the century. By the first decade of the 20th century however, fashion tastes began to change and whalebone prices collapsed. When the *Whalemen's Shipping List* published its last issue in December 1914, the whaling fleet consisted of just 32 ships. By the end of World War I, New Bedford was the only remaining whale port with just 12 ships operating. \n\nWhaling declined gradually for a long time through a variety of outside pressures.

                "answer": "<p>\"Nigga did not only describe the lives loathed; it also described the lives loved.\"\n\n- Yahdon Israel\n\nFrom the context of Israel's article that is listed in the sources, \"nigga\" is a term that exists as a critique of the placement of black culture in broader society and discussion on the the self in that culture of oppression. There are obviously connotative differences between \"nigger\" and \"nigga.\" The closeness of pronunciation is still enough difference between. You may have heard of someone saying the \"n-word\" and another person asking, \"with the hard r?\" \n\nIn terms of its understand in the academic community, it may be best to start with a quick discussion of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). It is also known as Ebonics. According to John Rickford on linguistic society.org, AAVE  grew out of African-American scholars desire to discuss Ebonics as a legitimate dialect of English instead as a derivative means of expression by an uneducated minority group.  AAVE did enjoy broader discussion until the Oakland School Board wrote a resolution that states that AAVE was the primary language of their African-American students. One of the consistent aspect of Ebonics is in pronunciation. In the case of \"nigga,\" the final consonant in omitted. So one could argue that \"nigga\" is essentially the same was \"nigger.\" However, the use of connotative and contextual meaning of \"nigger\" and \"nigga\" are broadly different. People reacted differently when Michael Richards shouted \"He's a nigger!\" than when\nGangsta Rap performs the song. The fact that African-Americans have taken to using a term that has historically been used to deride, dehumanize, or demean them can be seen as a type of agency. \"Nigger\" and \"nigga\" are the same word but who speaks truly changed the connotative meaning.\n\nHistorically, in mainstream culture in America, people usually see the term first used consistently among comedians like Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney. In an interview with Keith Olberman, Mooney states that while performing himself and writing for Pryor, one of their motivations for including \"nigga\" in the comedy was to \"depower\" the word. Later in the interview, he stated that he had stopped using the word. During this interview, he also states he started using the word in comedy for about 32 years. This interview was in 2006 during the Michael Richards fiasco at the Laugh Factory. So in mainstream culture, the usage of \"nigga\" likely begins in the early 1970s and was politically and critically motivated.\n\nThe word itself exists in our cultural contexts and means different things to every single person. Tupac Shakur turned the word into an acronym with positive connotations, \"Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished.\" The NAACP holds that the word in both its forms should not be used. It's meaning is truly diverse across racial boundaries.\n\nThe etymology of the two words come from Spanish \"negro.\" It was broadly accepted to refer to African-Americans as Negros until the mid-20th century. One of Fredrick Douglas most famous writings \"The Meaning of July Fourth to the Negro\" confirms the usage of the term among free blacks during the late antebellum period.  W.E.B Dubois used both \"negro\" and \"black\" in his writing. So even going into the 20 early mid-20th century, the writings of educated African Americans do not use the word \"nigga,\" however that is to be expected. DuBois did have some writing about the meaning of \"nigger\" and other terms used to generalize the black community. He in fact preferred the word \"negro\"as it is inaccurate. He states that African-Americans are indeed brown. So that is another aspect to consider. There may not have been slaves calling each other \"niggas\" but they were likely using some term to broadly categorize people. However, only relying on the primary sources written by educated black men betrays several other groups within the black community like women and the uneducated, these voices and perspectives are likely lost to us so we can only speculatively. Black people were definitely been using the term before Richard Pryor became popular in the mainstream. \n\nAs I stated previously, through Ebonics \"nigga\" is \"nigger\" interpreted through another culture.  The two words are inexorably connected to one another in which the existence of one almost guarantees the existence of the other. I will conclude with a quote from Dubois.\n\n\"Your real work, my dear young man, does not lie with names. It is not a matter of changing them, losing them, or forgetting them. Names are nothing but little guideposts along the Way. The Way would be there and just as hard and just as long if there were no guideposts, but not quite as easily followed! Your real work as a Negro lies in two directions: First, to let the world know what there is fine and genuine about the Negro race. And secondly, to see that there is nothing about that race which is worth contempt; your contempt, my contempt; or the contempt of the wide, wide world.\"\n\n-W.E.B Dubois\n\n\nSources\n\nhttp://thenewinquiry.com/essays/coming-to-america/\n\nhttp://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/what-ebonics-african-american-english\n\nhttp://www.virginia.edu/woodson/courses/aas102%20(spring%2001)/articles/names/dubois.htm</p>",

By default it refers to human males, but it is not inherently specified for 'race' nor is it necessarily always male or always human. Moreover, there are a number of grammatical constructions that make use of *nigga* where it's easier to think of the word as part of a term, either a pronoun (*a nigga* meaning *I/me*), a term of address (*nigga* for greater social distance, *my nigga* for closer social distance), or an honorific (*my nigga _______* for friends, *that nigga _____* for people who are not personal friends, and *this nigga _____* for people the speaker is mocking/going to mock).\n\n**As for when**, the earliest we could find (somewhat) mainstream use of *nigga* was the late 1960s early 1970s. You can start to see the change in use in [*The Last Poets'* \"Niggers are Scared of Revolution\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4H0rwumscA), or in Melvin Van Peebles' classic 1971 blaxpoitation film *Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song*, etc. \n\nIt was likely in some kind of use as far back as we can find reliable representations of black speech in varying degrees of semantic bleaching, but it's not until around the rise of the Black Power movement that you really start to see people reclaiming and reshaping the word.\n\n**A few other important things to note:**\n\n(1) *The* AA community did not begin to do this. There is not one monolithic black community. A significant number of black Americans do not speak AAE natively, and those who do may or may not speak a variety that has this use. They may not condone it. It's a complicated social issue, and it's important that we not take a reductionist view of ~40,000,000 people in the US.\n\n(2) it's generally best for someone who does not speak this variety of AAE natively to just *avoid using it*. There are plenty of ways to not say *nigga*, and if you're not someone who natively knows how to use it and has the pragmatic ability to determine when it's appropriate, *just don't*.\n\n(3) the above point is doubly true for white people -- claiming a linguist said it's a different word is not gonna get you out of a shitty situation when you say something everyone hears as a slur. \n\n</p>",

And, indeed, one would expect some reservations, at least by the countries that had occupied Poland at the time (Russia, Prussia, Austria). But, interestingly enough, there seem to be none. You'll find many assertions, that Marie Curie proposed the name exactly to bring attention to the lost independence of her home country [eg. [here](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S092058611200209X/1-s2.0-S092058611200209X-main.pdf?_tid=26561cd2-3478-11e6-b2f5-00000aacb360&acdnat=1466160312_8b718455fd7d52061033b3d67aaf3594), p. 2.], a statment that probably goes back to [Eve Curie's biography of her mother](https://books.google.de/books?id=3rd8CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT163&dq=madame+curie+could+we+call+it+polonium&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjwszP867NAhUJVxQKHZKSAYMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=madame%20curie%20could%20we%20call%20it%20polonium&f=false). Even though this book is debatable by historic standards, this is a more than reasonable assumption, regarding the fact that the Curies explained the element's name themselves as given in honour of the home country of one of them (the english translation of this excerpt of the original article is given by Eve as well, on the same page). Nevertheless, there seem to be no negative reactions to the name.\n\nThe only controversy about the name seems to have arisen, when the German chemist Marckwald discovered a radioactive elment and named it radiotellurium at a point, when Curie had not been able to isloate Polonium itself as yet.  Curie quickly  suspected that both elements were identical [Cf. e.g. [Otto Hahn Memories] (https://books.google.de/books?id=BAcAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=otto+hahn+controversy+polonium&source=bl&ots=iO5iadvwz9&sig=l-G5LiryQKbaoe164ykkbBK-zaM&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX0Lux7a7NAhUCOBQKHXZBA1QQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&q=otto%20hahn%20controversy%20polonium&f=false), p.22.], resulting in a longer scientific discourse  [cf. e.g. an [article by Rutherford that addresses this question] (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786440409463234?journalCode=tphm17#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMDgwLzE0Nzg2NDQwNDA5NDYzMjM0QEBAMA==) or this short notice in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v73/n1901/abs/073549b0.html) from 1906, in which an article, published by Curie in Physikalische Zeitschrift (1905), 6, is mentioned, in which she provided proof for her suspicion that the elements are identical]. Even though, some scientists considered the name radiotellurium to be better than Polonium (cf. the Hahn article mentioned above), there is no indication that this had anything to do with the political implications, rather they felt radiotellurium was describing the element (or rather his chemical properties) better.\n\nEdit: Fixed some mistakes I made.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I don't have the resources to answer most of your questions right now, but I can offer a beginning.\n\nThe thing you have to understand is that one very specific historical circumstance led to Edo's massive growth: the \"alternating attendance system\" (*sankin kotai*) enacted by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Basically, as a means of exerting social and economic control over the dozens of (often quite restive) feudal lords (*daimyo*) that constituted Japan's political structure - lords who I might add were in no way ideologically bound to the shogunate, a military dynasty with none of the \"divine right of kings\" stuff going on in Europe - the Tokugawas from the mid-17th century required them to spend alternating years in their capitol, Edo. And by \"them\" I mean the lords and like half of their massive retinues; their families were often forced to stay in Edo permanently, as basically hostages. Now as you can imagine, the costs of housing and feeding thousands of your dudes (to say nothing of moving them across country, *by foot*, once a year) were exorbitant, and that was the whole point of the law - to keep the daimyo from amassing enough money to become economic (thus potentially military) rivals. But on the flip side of the coin, all that money was being spent on goods and services, which means that Edo was the place to be if you were a merchant, or a craftsman, or a prostitute, etc., and wanted to get rich or at least make enough to live what we might roughly analogize to a middle-class existence, although it would have been a lot poorer than what we probably think of when we think of the middle class.\n\nOn the question of space, I'll just say that the Kanto Plain where Edo was/Tokyo is is vast, with lots of space to spread out. If you look at a map of Tokyo today, you might be amazed to know that many of the locations we (at least foreigners) think of as \"central Tokyo,\" like Shinjuku or Shibuya, were in fact basically countryside as recently as a hundred years ago. Of course that's not to say that there weren't slums, and that they weren't overcrowded and filthy like slums usually are.\n\nI'm going to stop there, but let me recommend some readings. Edward Seidensticker's *Low City, High City* is a bit dated now but still essential reading for the history of the city. On the question of welfare, check out the \"Evolution of Japanese-style Welfare\" chapter in Sheldon Garon's *Molding Japanese Minds.* \n\nAlso if you're interested in a 20th century interpretation of what daily life was like in the Edo period, I can't recommend the films of Yamanaka Sadao highly enough.

First, rice from all over the almost 8 million koku Shogunate realms (Tokugawa+Hatamoto) throughout Japan was shipped to Edo. Obviously not all of it, likely the majority stayed to feed the local domains. Whether or not the daimyos and their household in Edo also brought their own rice to pay their retainer and staff I actually don't know (probably not, see below). Still, that's a lot of rice flowing into Edo. And that's not counting merchants moving supplies in.\n\nIn the Edo, a lot of that rice was paid out to hatamoto samurai. Samurai who did not have a fief was paid in full or part in rice. So count it as a dole if you will. However it's likely the majority of that rice was not actually eaten by the samurai. Instead, it was given to rice merchants who either sold it for money, or used the rice as loan security deposit. The samurai would then go around spending that money and racking up debt and be a stimulus to the economy while being a legal pain-in-the-ass as they scream for debt forgiveness and argue with debtors.\n\nHowever, even with all that rice coming into Edo, we shouldn't be surprised that the Shogunate was finding it increasingly hard to feed the city, specifically to tackle with soaring rice prices. As part of a very wide-ranging set of new rules called the Ky\u014dh\u014d Reforms by the 8th Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune in the early to mid 18th century, all domains were encouraged to open up new lands, and land taxes were raised, leading to increased unrest. In addition, the terms of the Sankin K\u014dtai were slashed so there'd be less people in Edo to eat up all the food. \"Gifts\" from daimyos (tributes/taxes) were changed from money to rice. This helped to plummet rice prices and restore the Shogunate's finances, but ironically lead to a lot of economic hardship (the higher the price meant the samurai can borrow more which meant they can spent more which allowed merchants to prosper). It also lead to large fluctuations of rice prices until finally these parts of the reform were called off.\n\nRice alone isn't enough to feed everyone. 1 koku of rice comes to about 1500~1600 cal, and only the mid-upper  and upper class would be able to eat 1 koku of rice. Arizono Sh\u014dichir\u014d calculated that in Japan *on average* (not for Edo, but just putting that here, actual numbers varied wildly), in 1861 a person's diet composed of 47% rice. Besides rice, Edo also hosted a very lively fish market (it still does actually). When Edo was smaller, it was the focal supply point of fishes to Musashi province. Now that it was a giant city, it ate a lot of fish. Besides local fishing, Edo imported fish from afar. Everyday, no matter the weather (or so we're told) special cargo ships rush in from as far away as modern Ibaraki prefecture and Izu peninsula, bringing fish into the capital. They try to be as fast as possible, because fish spoil easily. Once they reach the harbour at Nihonbashi the peddlers snatch up all the fish. They then rush as fast as possible to all the restaurants, food stalls, and families that they already received orders from. You see there's no refrigeration, so they couldn't put the fish out on display for sale.\n\nAlso sent from those provinces were vegetables, this time to Kanda. Kanda and Nihonbashi were natural places for offloading goods, using rivers and the Edo Castle outer moat for ease of transport by water. Vegetables lasted slightly longer than fish, so there were some stalls that sold vegetables, but most of the transaction were still done by peddlers. We mustn't also count out local farming, of both rice and vegetables, which are clearly visible from surviving maps. While it obviously wasn't enough to supply the entire city, it's especially good to farm vegetables to be sold in the city, as vegetables spoil a lot easier than rice.\n\nA bit after our time period, but [here's a list of the most popular dishes in the early 19th century](http://i.imgur.com/Mecr3Ol.png) (And no I can't personally actually read it). It lists a lot of different dishes, most of it seem to be easy-to-make, family dishes, probably for home-cooking. There seem to be an emphasis on cheap stuff with lots of volume, and it also lists different ingredients (and so different dishes) for different seasons, which would be the norm in a pre-modern society. Most seem to be making stuff that goes with rice, with the most common ingredients being vegetable and fish, boiled, with miso or soy sause, pickled, or salted (so your traditional Japanese dishes).\n\nBesides eating at home, Edo boasted *a lot* of restaurants. \u014cta Nanbo wrote in the late 18th-early 19th century that Edo had a small restaurant every five steps, and a large one every ten. Even allowing for exaggeration or that he's only describing certain parts, that's very impressive. Most eating places specialized in certain dishes like tempura, sushi, [soba, ochazuke](http://i.imgur.com/t1BrtPQ.png), inari sushi, etc, etc. The majority of places seem to have been temporary street-side stalls, if even that. The ochazuke picture for example would have basically been the vender carrying his equipment and supplies and setting up to sell on the street wherever it seems good. In the more permanent restaurants, at least for the lower-class people, the norm seem to have been [just sitting down on the tatami, even just by the entrance, and eat](http://i.imgur.com/rLLpHGU.png). Tables did not become widespread until post-Meiji, and chairs not until post WWII.\n\nMore fancy places existed too, [with gardens and often multi-stories](http://i.imgur.com/x68E41J.png) and everything. [Here's the most popular ones in the early 18th century](http://i.imgur.com/CJ3IPKJ.png).\n\n**Sources**  \nConrad Totman. *Early modern Japan*. 1995.  \n\u77f3\u5ddd\u82f1\u8f14. *\u5b9f\u898b \u6c5f\u6238\u306e\u66ae\u3089\u3057 (\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e\u6587\u5eab)*. 2013.  \nCharlotte von Verschuer.

Cash, obviously, if you've got it, you carry, but the usual late-20C/21C wallet is full of lots of non-cash identity-tracking items that don't really have any pre-20C analogue. The mid-late 19C got very into calling cards, but even at their height you wouldn't see those in the wallets of \"the vast majority,\" only the middle class.\n\nThere's only one real answer to your question I can think of: _food and drink_. That's the main category you'd see a lot more of in earlier centuries' \"everyday carry\" than you might expect based on our 21C experience. Depending on what people planned to do during a day they'd be expecting to travel distances with sparse availability of food for purchase, or clean water for the taking. Once you start noticing this you'll see almost any 18C/19C narrative describes bundling up a bunch of sandwiches, etc., as part of one's daily preparations before heading out. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Distribution of land ownership and use in the rural Byzantine Empire was definitely not even. By the eleventh century, there are some very powerful large-scale landholders (including monasteries, although at least in urban areas, sometimes even a monastery was controlled by an aristocrat), a few small landowners hanging in there, and then most of the population would have been *paroikoi* or dependent peasants: tenant farmers. \n\nFor the powerful landowners, including monasteries, tax collection was mostly a game of tax *evasion*. Tax collectors remained a popular bogeyman of Byzantine literature and art as they had been in Roman times, and this hostility was mirrored by practice. Owners might work to avoid periodic visits by imperial tax assessors to revaluate their land at a higher tax amount, pay their taxes using a debased currency, or send someone chasing after a tax collector to steal back the money. (Anna Komnene tells a similar story in her *Alexiad.*)\n\nMost Byzantine people, however, were peasants who were responsible for paying their taxes (a) collectively and (b) often indirectly. The tenant farmers paid most of their tax burden to the owner of their land. In a case like that, they would presumably be fairly familiar with the people involved. Otherwise, taxes were levied collectively on a village. This had the advantage, for the peasants, of helping out if one family had a rough year. It had the disadvantage of--one of the reasons for this system--that local land abandoned or unfarmed was still part of the total levy for an area. So people had to cover for each other. But tax evasion was at least sometimes practiced by peasants--or at least, financial documents complain about peasants who simply *disappear* when they know a tax collector is in the area!\n\nAs for identifying the tax collectors themselves: at least some tax officials, most prominently the *kommerkiarioi* (who, as their name indicates, were involved with regulating commerce), had official imperial seals. [This Google Books preview](https://books.google.com/books?id=86Of2XxW2NMC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=tax+collector&source=bl&ots=QrkuiQ01ca&sig=zyIlQMc72Xz_EP0bBx8c4pRfV40&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZ3bmDioTRAhVJ5GMKHf9aCMgQ6AEINDAE#v=snippet&q=collector&f=false) shows a couple of them, although they are both ninth century. Seals were pretty serious business in medieval Europe. The collective payment and indirect payment methods certainly suggest that at least some of the people involved would have been able to recognize the seal for what it was (medieval peasants are, as a rule, stereotyped in contemporary sources as stupid, but at least from later legal sources we can see a good deal of ability to negotiate successfully the demands of a more literate and educated \"elite\" culture).</p>",

Do you mean a farmer working on an estate or the man who owned it?\n\nThis is a PDF extract from [*The Economic History of Byzantium: From the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century*](http://www.doaks.org/resources/publications/doaks-online-publications/economic-history-of-byzantium/ehb44-state-and-the-economy). You'll want to look around pages 991-993, under *Administrative Structures*, but here are the basics:\n\n- Administration was concentrated in Constantinople, with an extensive hierarchy. Provincial offices were replete with scores of officials whose names varied by their duties. Messengers called *mandatores* would have communicated between offices and estate owners, so everyone knew the rate, and when and whom they could expect to come collect. Additionally, state-owned estates would have managers to ensure things ran smoothly.\n\n- **Each office would bear its own seal.** For the seals, themselves, this text references *Le corpus des sceaux de l'empire byzantin*. You don't need to read French to understand the basic designations of office, nor view the seals, themselves. They do come with handy little notes, though. If an \"official\" did not bear the recognized seal, they would probably be sent back empty-handed. The source I provided gives us no recourse on the matter of being cheated. From its perspective, the bureaucracy appears thick enough to resist thievery and impersonation on a large scale.\n\n- Also, local tax positions could be bought for small fortunes (**could be**, not ubiquitously) and salaries were paid out of taxes collected. In the provinces these positions were coveted. It was a good enough deal for both official and government; they were mutually invested in ensuring collection.\n\n\nThere's a heck of a lot more, and fortunately the writing isn't as dry as it could be, so give it a read and see if it helps!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Disclaimer, I\u2019m an epidemiologist, not a historian. To answer the above question briefly, smoking was suggested as a cause of health problems for much of the first half of the 20th century, but there was a real fight in the medical literature about whether or not it could be proven as a cause of the more serious health effects. As such, smoking likely didn\u2019t seem very dangerous.  \n\nI\u2019m going to mostly stick to lung cancer rather than more common conditions, like coughing, since that\u2019s better recorded in the literature. Lung cancer was incredibly rare prior to the 20th century, so much so that in \u201c1900 only about 140 cases were known in the published medical literature\u201d (Proctor, RN 2012).  That\u2019s 140 cases ever, rather than 140 cases per year. Smoking became more commonplace towards the end of the 1800s and the first decades of the 1900s, but the increase in lung cancer took some time. By the 1920s, lung cancer was much more frequent than it used to be, and there were a variety of reasons given for this increase. Smoking was blamed, but so was asphalt dust, industrial air pollution, prior exposure to the poison gases used in WWI, or even the latent effects of the 1918 global influenza.  \n\nSo while smoking was blamed, it certainly wasn\u2019t accepted as the cause of lung cancer, particularly by the medical field. Part of the reason for this was the model/concept of how causes for diseases were determined. \n\nDuring the end of the 1800s and the early 1900s, the primary conceptual model for how to determine a causative relationship between a particular exposure (e.g., microbe) and a particular disease were Koch\u2019s postulates (published 1890).  There were four basic criteria that had to be met for a microbe to be a cause of some disease: 1. those with the disease must have the microbe present in their tissue; 2. The microbe has to be isolated and grown in pure culture; 3. When injected into a healthy animal, that microbe must cause the disease; and 4. You have to isolate the same microbe from the newly infected and diseased animal. \n\nKoch\u2019s criteria for establishing a cause of a disease really break down when it comes to most environmental exposures. Often, a single exposure (like smoking) can cause many different health outcomes (lung cancer, heart disease, death), so you don\u2019t get a good one-to-one relationship like the microbe and infectious disease relationships that were being proved using Koch\u2019s postulates. \n\nSo researchers were sort of in a stage of \u201cassociation does not equal causation\u201d stage. One quote to illustrate: \u201cWhile most students of the problem of the aetiology of lung cancer admit to an association between smoking and lung cancer, some question whether this association also represents causation\u201d (Wynder, E.L. 1957)\n\nThere really needed to be an avalanche of evidence for the smoking-lung cancer causation to be proven. And there was. Chemists found cancer-causing chemicals in cigarette smoke, cell line experiments found that cigarette smoke caused damage to cells that were similar to lung cells, animal experiments found that tumors could be created by painting cigarette smoke tar onto the skin of mice, and there were several population studies of smokers and non-smokers showing increased incidence of lung cancer, heart disease, and mortality not only among smokers compared to non-smokers, but among heavier smokers compared to more casual smokers. \n\nEven so, many in the public and even doctors were unconvinced. \n\u201cIn 1954, for example, George Gallup sampled a broad swath of the US public to ask: \u2018do you think cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer, or not?\u2019 41% answered \u2018yes\u2019, with the remainder answering either \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018undecided\u2019. Even large numbers of doctors remained unconvinced. In 1960, in a poll organised by the American Cancer Society, only a third of all US doctors agreed that cigarette smoking should be considered \u2018a major cause of lung cancer\u2019. This same poll revealed that 43% of all American doctors were still smoking cigarettes on a regular basis, with occasional users accounting for another 5%. With half of all doctors smoking, it should come as no surprise that most Americans remained unconvinced of life-threatening harms from the habit.\u201d \u2013Proctor,RN 2011\n\nThe public at the time was probably used to seeing many of their peers smoking, with no apparent health effects (it takes years for these to develop), and it was a habit they likely enjoyed. Researchers were still arguing about how to go about proving causation, so for many, it probably seemed like cigarettes weren\u2019t all that bad. \n\nIt might make more sense to think about a health exposure that might be harmful today. The generation that smoked was probably very similar to our generation with regard to eating unhealthy food or not exercising, in that there were likely some observable, well-recognized drawbacks, but not enough to stop altogether. Smoking was likely known to have some downsides like coughing, but the sense that a single cigarette was dangerous just wasn\u2019t there. \n\nDoll R, Hill AB.

I hope this gets the ball rolling in the short time I have before I have to run off to work.\n\nBefore the British colonies in North America began cultivating their own tobacco, Europeans often traded with the Native Americans for tobacco. As such, it was an increasingly popular product in Europe, Britain especially. It would eventually become the cash crop of the first Southern colonies.\n\nThat does not mean that contemporary people were ignorant of its negative health effects. While belief in the four humors was still prevalent, obvious physical damage caused by tobacco smoking created resistance to the proliferation of the product. The most notable of those against tobacco was King James I, who in 1604 published *A Counterblaste to Tobacco*. James considered it  \"inconsiderate and childish affectation of Noveltie\" that the British would need to control.\n\nJames first argues that the origins of tobacco smoking are unwholesome and beneath the British. The Native Americans used them the \"common herbe\" to prevent smallpox; James argues that it is ineffective and that they suffer from the disease mainly because of their general uncleanliness:\n> For Tobacco being a common herbe, which (though under divers names) growes almost every where, was first found out by some of the barbarous Indians, to be a Preservative, or Antidot against the Pockes, a filthy disease, whereunto these barbarous people are (as all men know) very much subject, what through the uncleanly and adust constitution of their bodies.\n\nTobacco smoking, James argues, is a popular activity for the barbarous Native Americans. By engaging in the activity themselves, the British are lowering themselves to the same level as the uncivilized inhabitants of the New World.\n\nJames then considers the positive and negative health effects of tobacco smoking in relation to the four humors, a long argument that fits with the concept at the time but will seem confusing and illogical to the modern reader. He concludes with an emphasis on smoking being habit forming. He the smoker to a person who eats meat and drinks alcohol continually, falling into lethargy and addiction and being unable to disengage such behavior:\n> Many in this kingdome have had such a continuall use of taking this uusavorie smoke, as now they are not able to forbeare the same, no more then an olde drunkard can abide to be long sober, without falling into an uncurable weaknesse and evill constitution: for their continuall custome hath made to them, *habitum, alteram naturam* [Latin: habit, second nature].\n\nHe then launches into smoking's intrusion into social customs, where it does not belong. Particular contempt is reserved for men who smoke at the dining table in the presence of non-smokers. He also claims that addiction to smoking tobacco precludes service to King and Country. \n\nEmbedded within this diatribe is a particularly important observation: the physical damage done to the lungs by smoking tobacco. \n> And for the vanities committed in this filthie custome, is it not both great vanitie and uncleanenesse, that at the table, a place of respect, of cleanlinesse, of modestie, men should not be ashamed, to sit tossing of Tobacco pipes, and puffing of the smoke of Tobacco one to another, making the filthy smoke and stinke thereof, to exhale athwart the dishes, and infect the aire, when very often, men that abhorre it are at their repast? Surely Smoke becomes a kitchin far better then a Dining chamber, **and yet it makes a kitchin also oftentimes in the inward parts of men, soiling and infecting them, with an unctuous and oily kinde of Soote, as hath bene found in some great Tobacco takers, that after their death were opened.** [emphasis mine]\n\nJames concludes by condemning tobacco smoking as \"a custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs, and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse.\" \n\nSource:\nBonevac, Dan. \"A Counterblaste to Tobacco.

Himmler realized quickly that there would be no Reich after the war ended and he, among other leading Nazis, would be prosecuted for his crimes. He went into hiding, to famously be caught later and subsequently committing suicide. Goering however was heavily drugged up for some time which could have played a part in his mindset. He also felt that he had nothing to apologize about (making quite a show of himself during the trials after his capture) and overall did not feel like the criminal he really was. Also of note, he had quite the ego... though that's a bit speculative for this sub, just thought it was worth a mention. I believe he did write a letter to Eisenhower before his capture to discuss potential surrender terms, though I don't have my books around me right now. I may be wrong, remember reading this at some point, but if true leads me to further believe he truly felt that he was not in major risk of war crime charges.\n\nThe Nazi leaders expectations really were person to person. The large number of suicides in the last days of the Reich suggest to me that many leaders knew exactly what they had done and what they were in for. Many were involved not only directly in the Holocaust and general war crimes, but the attempts to cover up their crimes. Many that officially surrendered probably felt they had a chance in a court of law, and in fact some were able to get by with just prison time (most famous in my opinion being Albert Speer) as they were never directly involved in war crimes.\n\nSo, it was delusional in some cases, in others such as Goering it most definitely was, but it really was a case by case. Some showed remorse, though most didn't, Goering himself was defiant for the trials and obviously got the last laugh by killing himself.\n\nAdding some sources:\n\nFor Goering specifically, I really liked Goering: The Rise and Fall of the Notorious Nazi Leader. \n\nGeneral reading, which is most of my knowledge on the Third Reich, I have suggested this probably a couple of times here before - but I really do enjoy Richard Evans' trilogy. It's comprehensive and will give a great picture of many aspects of the Reich at the key time periods.\n\nSpeer's \"Inside the Third Reich\" is good, though obviously questionable, but he speaks about Goering and actions during the war in quite a few parts. Nothing comes to mind as \"proof he was a war criminal\", but most certainly there are sections about Goering making big decisions (and big promises) in regards to action on the Eastern Front. Though Goering was a \"likable\" Nazi on the whole and had a personality about him that people really seemed to trust... he most definitely was a criminal. If at the very least being one of the highest ranking Nazis for the duration of the Reich.\n\nMore edits..\n\n/u/Crytash makes some good points about the suicides. Definitely a factor here, I would just say that though many did kill themselves for those reasons, there were many that simply knew what was coming. Maybe speculative as well, definitely an interesting argument.\n\nAlso, you are right about Kershaw's \"The End\", very good book about the chaos during the last year and some of the motivations behind the actions taken by the Nazis.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>This is a bit outside my personal field of study, but through undergrad and grad school, I took a few courses specific to WWII, and read a few books that might be able to shed a little light on this. I defer to a WWII specialist, of course, but here it goes...\n\nIn 'Ordinary Men' historian Christopher Browning touched on this just a bit. It was either in this book, or Lucy Dawidowicz's 'The War Against the Jews' (both very good Holocaust histories) that I recall reading about Himmler fussing over his expected meeting with Eisenhower, and whether it would be appropriate to brow-salute (a-la the American tradition), Nazi-salute (\"Heil Hitler\" style), or offer his hand for a shake. Of course Eisenhower wanted nothing to do with the man (on a personal level anyway), and similarly ordered Himmler arrested like Goering was. Thus, Himmler also seemed surprised that he wasn't offered to Eisenhower for official surrender and negotiations. \n\nI think this probably boils down to individual personalities and the roles they played in the Nazi regime. For example, Himmler and Goering were a part of Hitler's inner-circle, and as a result were a bit disconnected from some of the realities at play. They had either become delusional, or (and I think this is more likely) they had convinced themselves that their elevated rank within the government afforded them certain privileges among soldiers of a particular rank. And while they probably didn't have any delusions about how the Russians would treat them, they appear to have believed that since the atrocities of the Holocaust hadn't touched the Western Allies as deeply as the Russians, that better terms (and a foundation for negotiations) could be had with the Americans and British. \n\nOther senior leaders that were a bit more removed from the constant political in-fighting notorious among Hitler's top lieutenants seemed to have been slightly more realistic about how things would shake out (in terms of being held accountable for war crimes, etc). Albert Speer, for example, didn't seem all that surprised at his arrest, and actually showed a lot of contrition during (and after) the Nuremberg trials.\n\nAlso, it would have been reasonable to assume (at least on some level to men like Himmler and Goering) that Germany, in complete ruin following years of heavy bombing, might have benefited from having experienced leaders who could have untangled the infrastructure bureaucracy that needed to be corralled to get water running and electricity flowing again. Indeed, this may have been the case had the Nazis not engaged in systematic murder of millions of Russians, Poles, Jews, Gypsies, POW's, homosexuals, political opponents, etc. So again, I think that goes back to a certain level of accumulated delusion that Himmler and Goering likely possessed at the time. \n\nThese were two guys who had very few checks on their total authority and power (except, of course for Hitler). With Hitler gone, these guys probably thought they could finally spread their wings, and act on the hard-fought authority they'd gained during roughly 20 years of insane political and military intrigue. It was for this reason that they probably viewed themselves as professional contemporaries of men like Eisenhower, yet it didn't take long for them to grasp what the true situation was. \n\nStill, even Goering never seemed to totally appreciate what was going on until the very end. He was a tenacious and combative opponent of the Nuremberg prosecution, and only seemed to really be put in check when that same prosecution played film of the death camps during the Nuremberg trial. Thus, we might assume that Goering and Himmler, who always worked hard to cover up any physical evidence of the Holocaust, might have thought that since there was no physical piece of evidence directly connecting them to the murder of an innocent, they might be spared on legal grounds. Orders were given to destroy the camps, prisoners, and any physical evidence, so the delusional (want-to-believe-it-so-bad-it-becomes-personally-true) might have also been a factor at play. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>There's something in this that no one has mentioned but is very relevant to the discussion. Goering was the head of the Luftwaffe; the German Air Force. The Air Force, being a very new element to warfare, was considered to be very gentlemanly, and as a POW, especially one of high rank, he would be normally be accorded many luxuries and privileges. Even in the [Geneva Convention on the Treatment of POW](https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/y3gctpw.htm) is also very detailed about the treatment of POWs, and does accord more rights and privileges to POWs of higher rank, with the most being accorded to Generals, as Goering was. The Allies saw Goering as a criminal, but he no doubt saw himself as simply another military member, and entitled to the full rights of the convention, and not to be treated as a criminal.\n\nEven during WWII, the Luftwaffe handled Allied POWs from the Air Force, who were generally treated better than their Army or Navy counterparts, when under the supervision of the Luftwaffe. \n\nAs far as Goering himself, if you read his confessions and [testimony at Nuremberg](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/Goering1.html), he's pretty unabashedly unapologetic for his actions. As a General in a time of war, he would expect to be treated as a POW of high rank, not as a murderer on trial. \n\nYou also have to look at the Nuremberg trials in the context of the time. The crimes they were being accused of were LITERALLY the very first time anyone were put on trial for Crimes Against Humanity, and the trial of this kind and scope were completely without precedent. For someone who obviously feels their actions were justified in the context of a war, and feels they are no worse than the enemies they faced in the battlefield, how must they have felt to be told that their actions are so heinous, so terrible, that entirely new laws must be written just to put them on trial for them? \n\nWe have the luxury of hindsight in this, but when the information of the Holocaust was being released, no one knew what to do. Eisenhower ordered as much footage to be taken as possibly, because he knew no one would believe the size and scope of it. Given the number of holocaust deniers today, it seems a sensible idea. But at the time, it was unfathomable and people couldn't believe that something so horrific could have happened. It wasn't even imaginable. Even Germans living within proximity of a concentration camp didn't always know what was happening, or certainly the full extent of it. \n\nThen you take the attitude towards Jews in general. Not even in Germany, but everywhere in the world. Germany tried to deport millions of Jews prior to the war, but most countries refused, or only took a small number. In Canada, the Immigration minister at the time was infamously quoted as saying \"[None is too many](http://umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol11no2/noneistoomany.html)\" with regards to allowing Jewish refugees into Canada. In the US there were [similar attitudes](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007094) of anti-semitism, and a dislike of Jewish immigration. While the Allies didn't know the full extent of the Holocaust, they did know some of it, and bear some responsibility for failing to act earlier and more decisively to get Jews out of Europe. Goering would have known all this, and known the very publicly-expressed anti-Semitic sentiments of the Allies, and their actions against Jewish immigration, so it would seem somewhat hypocritical to be put on trial by people who are somewhat complicit (if only by inaction or neglect) in the crimes they're accusing you of. </p>",

Ultimately however, the Hehe were beaten and their leader executed and his skull taken to Germany. There he was used as a prime example for an African leader and as such a good object for the research in phrenology. With racism rampant at the time, they tried to prove that the shape of the skull determined the intelligence and \"culture\" of its owner.\nThen came the First World War and Germany lost and had to accept the Versaille's treaty. German East Africa was a colony, part of the Versaille's treaty was the hand-over of all German colonies over to the V\u00f6lkerbund/League of Nations. The United Kingdom became the new \"protector/governor\" of the territories that made up the former colony. To make the hand-over easier and to make the local tribes more acceptive towards the new power, they asked the Germans to hand over the skull of the local hero of Mkwawa.\n\nThat's not the end of the story, however. The skull didn't make it there because nobody knew where it went. As you can tell from the book you mention. It took a very determined Englishman to finally find it in a museum in Bremen.

When the Germans entered the scramble for Africa there were only a handful of unclaimed pieces left, and one of them belonged to the Hehe. Mkwawa was a war leader that resisted the take over, in 1891 he declared war by completely destroying a German column 320 men strong effectively ending German control of the area until 1894. A much larger German force took the Hehe fortress at Kalenga, reasserting some measure of territorial control, but Mkwawa led some three thousand men against German colonial authorities until 1898 when he was caught out and shot himself to avoid capture.\n\nDuring the First World War the area was engulfed in a protracted conflict as [Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Lettow-Vorbeck) launched one of the most successful German campaigns of the war, pinning down more than 300,000 allied troops with an army that never exceeded 14,000. Despite being undefeated in the field, German forces were unable to hold the colony largely due to the assistance of the Wahehe people. The British included the return of the skull of one of their folk heroes as a way to pay them back for their contributions to the war effort.\n\nThe Germans claimed they simply didn't have it, and despite going through the records of the museums in question British diplomats were unable to locate the skull.\n\nThat was that until 1954, when Sir Edward Twinning (of *A History of the Crown Jewels of Europe* fame), who was governor of what would become Tanzania at the time, went to the Bremen Museum and examined some 84 uncategorized skills from German East Africa by hand. He located one that was the correct size and shape, with a wound consistent with the eyewitness account of the death of Chief Mkwawa. Under the terms of the treaty this skull was handed over and now sits in the Mkwawa Memorial Museum in Kalenga, although there is some dispute as to whether or not this is the actual skull or not.\n\n[Here is a Die Spiegel piece on the subject](http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/friedensvertrag-verrueckt-a-948382.html#featuredEntry).\n\nUnfortunately, virtually everything on this topic is either in German or rather dated.

Her somewhat stubby 56\" main wheels, known as \"drivers\" limited her actual top speed to 70mph. At the top end of her operational speed the valve gear barely has time to cycle steam through both sides of the steam cylinders. Often in steam locomotive design speed was limited by wheel diameter and cylinder design. I'm sure some high drivered 4-4-0 \"American\" type locomotives were capable of 88 mph in 1885. In 1893, the modified New York Central 999 pulled an express train at 102 mph. The other main limiting factor in speed in those days was track maintenance. Rich roads like the NYC, or Pennsylvania had meticulously maintained track specifically to maintain high speeds. The backwater Sierra with its hilly grade profile, historically famous sharp curves (read up on the Angels branch) and questionable track maintenance and track geometry would limit most revenue service to less than 40 if not 25 over most of the route. The steel rails themselves of the 1885 era were very spindly, often 40lb per yard, while big mainlines would have been laid with 80lb per yard steel rail. To the average reader this might not mean much, but what it means is the sturdiness of the rail dictated how much weight and lateral force you can put on the rails without them breaking gauge. \n\nTo go down your list of questions, yes. Britain in particlar was speed obsessed. Deeper inquiry into this will reveal a speed war between the main RRs of the time. \n\nIn 1895, the LNWR used their 2-4-0 \"Hardwicke\" to break the 90mph barrier on August 22nd 1895.\n\nI have more information to share, but I'm on mobile.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold!

Continuous, or air brakes. Braking is accomplished by the use of compressed air through a train pipe.\n2. Independent, or buffer brakes. Braking is accomplished via manual mechanical brakes. \n\nVacuum brakes were also invented around this period of time (1872), but they were never very popular in the US. Vacuum brakes worked on the principle of creating vacuum in a train pipe to apply the brakes (these could fail catastrophically if there was a leak).\n\nI won't talk about the manual braking systems, because the downsides to that system should be fairly obvious (inability to apply brakes simultaneously).\n\nIn 1869, the first Westinghouse air brake came into service. It was a \"straight air brake,\" which meant that compressed air from a storage reservoir in the locomotive was used used via a train pipe to apply the brakes via a brake cylinder in each car.\n\nThere were problems with this system:\n\n1. If the brake hose burst, or the train broke apart, all air pressure would be lost and you would lose the brakes. \n2. It was slow to apply or release the brakes.\n3. The brakes were applied to cars nearest the locomotive sooner than cars farther away, causing pileups. This made trains longer than 10 cars impracticable.\n\nIt wasn't until 1872 that Westinghouse invented the automatic air brake. The major innovation this introduced were separate auxiliary air reservoirs in each car, charged by the train pipe and controlled by a triple valve.\n\nIf the air pressure in the train pipe is higher than that of the auxiliary reservoir, the triple valve releases the brake and charges the auxiliary reservoir. If the opposite is true, the brake is applied via air pressure from the auxiliary reservoir.\n\nThus, if the engineer applies a service brake pipe reduction, a hose pipe bursts, or the train splits, air pressure will be reduced in the train pipe and all brakes will be applied via air from the auxiliary reservoirs.\n\nThere is, of course, a lot more, but I'm not an engineer and my ability to understand some of the descriptions and mathematical calculations in the source material is limited.\n\n\nDerr, Louis. \"Air Brakes.\" Cyclopedia of Engineering, Volume III.

The empress seemed to accept his apology. \n\nRasputin was originally sent for when the Empress, desperate to have her son Alexei healed from his illness, allowed the *starets* (mystical man of God) to treat her son. \n\nOverjoyed by Rasputin's apparent healing of the tsarverich, the weak little boy on whom the dynasty relied upon, Alexandra showered him with gifts. He began wearing a silk blouse, had a personal secretary, and was given a car.  He also began making policy suggestions to Alexandra, who was filling in for Nicholas while he was away at the front, like some kind of ancient tsar-warrior leading his troops. In real life he could do little - he had only ever obtained the rank of colonel in the army, IIRC.\n\nSo was Rasputin a true, yet flawed holy man or a mere charlatan? This would depend on who you ask. Most historians do not, of course, view him positively. Few would doubt that the tsarervich did seem to get better after Rasputin saw him. (Rasputin had said that the boy should not be disturbed by doctors. Coincidentally or not, we now know that sufferers of hemophilia, young Alexei's condition, are sometimes best left alone). \n\nAccording to Prince Felix Yusopov, a close relation to the tsar and possible the richest man in tsar Russia, Rasputin had once told him, boasting of his influence on the empress: \"I'll have you made a minister if you like\" or words to that effect. However, Yusupov, who together with other nobles went on to murder Rasputin, was known for embellishing the truth, to put it mildly.\n\nPerhaps we'll never truly know. \n\n(Source: Nicholas and Alexandra, by Robert K.

He clearly was a charismatic man who held beliefs of some kind. The man was Nicholas II's personal confessor and his supposed healing of Alexei's hemophilia definitely allowed him access to larger amounts of influence within the royal family. I don't think he ever really wanted political power, or to significantly mislead the royal family. It seems to me that he was able to work his way into their good graces by being the right person in the right place and at the right time.\n\nNow as to his influence on politics in late Tsarist Russia, as I stated before I think his own personal influence has been overstated immensely. Perhaps this is best evidenced by how little changed in Russian politics between his rise to prominence and his assassination. The image I think that is most often presented in regards to Rasputin is that through his healing of Alexei he was able to grow close to the Tsarina. Close enough that rumors of adultery between the two spread. This combined with the perception (one that both contemporaries and historians of today hold) that Nicholas II was heavily influenced by his wife Alexandra (who herself was viewed with distrust by the Russian public due to her German heritage) have lead to people arguing that in turn Rasputin was able to influence Nicholas heavily during WWI.\n\nNicholas II was a ruler who utilized what Sarah Badock has termed \"highly personalized power\". This meant that it was incredibly hard for the Russian government to properly prepare for war in 1914 as Nicholas retained and spent vast quantities of time on more ceremonial aspects of Tsarist rule that had been tradition for centuries and control was largely rooted in his person as opposed to ministers and ministries. Because of this Russian began war poorly quipped in terms of artillery shells, uniforms as well as poor leadership organization. In turn the low moral of Russia's peasant soldiers all meant that Russia's war effort went poorly and this culminated in 1915 with the 'Great Retreat'. Nicholas' personal style of ruler ship meant that when Nicholas made himself supreme commander of Russia's army in 1915 he, more than ever, linked the failings of his autocratic state with Russia's military failings throughout WWI further reducing confidence in his government. His decision to appoint himself as supreme commander was both productive and unproductive. In some ways the very fact that his appointment increased the linkages between the autocratic state and the army meant that there was less rivalry or conflict between these institutions, yet this very linkage would prove to be very damaging. \n\nPaul Miliukov, a historian and liberal politician, famously took to the floor of the Duma to deride the government's handling and planning of the war effort saying, \"glupost\u2019 ili izmena\", was it stupidity or treason? This sentiment was widely shared by the Russian populace, widespread derision for the apparent incompetence that had lead to the numerous failings in Russia's preparedness for war. Miliukov's statement also shows how far he and other liberal politicians had shifted in their support for the government. Initially the war proved to be something for a divided society and polity to rally around. Yet as Russia continued to suffer setbacks Nicholas' personal reputation continued to fall, as did faith in his government and the overall idea of Tsarist rule, all of which were key to his ability to effectively wield this \"personalized power\". Perhaps Rasputin's greatest influence was to further damage the reputation or public image of Nicholas and the royal family (which was so key to Nicholas) more than any actual political decision making by the man himself. \n\nThe Russian government's failing in war exacerbated political divides within the country. The shortages of food and other good for civilians gave rise to 'voluntary organizations' the experience of which taught local Russian government and civilians how to rule efficiently and effectively themselves and further exposed the failings of the state. In turn Nicholas was unable to work with the Russian Duma despite their overwhelming outpouring of support for the war effort and general patriotism which both further emphasized the problems of tsarist rule and the Tsar's increasing isolation on the front. Society's experience of mobilizing the Russian economy for war often without state support fostered the opinion that the Tsar should work with society (through the Duma) more and also exposed the failings of true autocratic rule. Rasputin's role in this was minimal if it existed at all and he was more a representative of some of these problems than the cause of them. \n\nI'm sorry to write so much about other people besides Rasputin but this pervasive notion of Rasputin wielding significant influence and having really affected anything at all is one of my biggest pet peeves in Russian history. \n\n**Sources**\n\n*Late Imperial Russia - Problems and Prospects* - Edited by Ian Thatcher\n\n*Russia in the Age of Modernization and Revolution, 1881-1917* by Hans Rogger\n\n\n**Edit**\n\nI suppose, having re-read this, that I didn't explicitly answer OPs question. I suppose I would emphasize the struggle that reconstructing Rasputin's personal goals/drive would be. I would also argue that it is ultimately (an I mean this with no disrespect) a bad historical question. I don't think we gain any interesting insights into late Tsarist Russia by asking what Rasputin wanted. Asking historical questions is hard (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4cewq8/on_adolf_hitler_great_man_theory_and_asking/?)) and I applaud anyone who takes the time to do so. I suppose I was trying to take OPs question and his desire for information and hopefully help steer him in better directions of inquiry! I feel like that\u2019s half the idea of this sub.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>*NSFW to be safe*\n\nLet's be clear about one thing to start with: although the social history of childbirth in the later Middle Ages into the early modern era has been painted in scholarship as male professionals increasingly exerting authoritative control over women's bodies and women's rituals, pregnancy and its implications were first and foremost concerns for *women*. This is true in terms of [maternal mortality in childbirth](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3w2690/suppose_youre_giving_birth_in_1398_in_either/cxsrm98/) (scholars calculate around 1-3% per childbirth, for a lifetime risk perhaps around 10%), in terms of social stigma and legal punishment for an out of wedlock birth, in terms of financial cost (women could sue for child support, but the outcome was...uncertain, and suits could lead to their own exile *with their children*), in terms of emotional cost in case of divorce or widowhood (Italian widows returned to their father's home, but any children were the property of the dead husband's family).\n\nI open with this because the focus on women and women's health makes the question not as straightforward as one might hope. First there is the gap between the prescriptive, Latin-based (eventually translated) academic medical tradition and practices \"on the ground.\" Second, there is a [lingering and often hilarious discomfort](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/42svcr/did_the_church_have_different_standards_for_how/czdmf0z) in sources--especially from clerics--about women's sexual practices. Even as they denounce women as seductresses and temptresses, they are too scared to mention sexual practices (masturbation! lesbian sex!) outright lest they be the one to plant the idea in women's fragile, innocent minds. And third, less related to the gender, is the question of *actual* versus *perceived/hoped-for* efficacy of any birth control methods.\n\nWhether we look at medical texts, religious instructional literature, or legal records, however, there is no doubt that just as many women longed for children and tried desperately to make that happen, many others sought the opposite.\n\nThe most basic way to prevent childbirth is obviously not to have sex, barring a certain Blessed Virgin. (I am still hoping to find, someday, a court record of a woman claiming her out-of-wedlock kid was a virgin birth). If the [early medieval penitential rules](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/flowchart.png) on sex were taken seriously, it would not have left many opportunities for pregnancy, which is not a \"guaranteed\" thing for sure. Buuuut the general nature of later medieval literature and, by the time we start having descriptive rather than prescriptive sources about sex, court records suggest these guidelines were...guidelines at best, and maybe not even that (the penitentials are a tempermental historical source).\n\nStill, there were definitely some women, including married ones, who created lives of post-nuptial (and sometimes post-childbirth) chastity. 13th century holy woman Marie d'Oignies and her husband opted for a celibate marriage, and 15th century inventor of autobiography Margery Kempe and her husband at least tried for it. (The confused chronology of Kempe's *Book* makes it unclear whether they succeeded completely). Also, total celibacy For All Time was not necessary. Although noble women (and sometimes men) tended to marry young--[NOT a blanket rule for the Middle Ages] (https://redd.it/3pafst)--women's age at first childbirth was frequently in the 18-20 range rather than the 13-14 one might fear.\n\nMedical texts and court records make it clear that herbs, spices, and liquid remedies, the medicines of the Middle Ages, were a major choice when it came to birth control, Plan B, and outright abortifacients. The typical language in the sources is \"to provoke menstruation\" or \"to resume menses,\" but occasionally an author will be more explicit. \n\nJohn Riddle has done fascinating work cataloguing lists of birth control/abortion herbs referenced in ancient and medieval sources, including tracing ideas from Arabic medical literature that ends up in the Latin canon. His two big points are (1) that some of the herb combinations could possibly have had somewhat of an impact and (2) the Middle Ages, as zealously Christian as their writers could be--all university-trained physicians were at least minor clerics--were not always prudish or reticient or SIN SIN SIN about herbs that might limit childbirth, although that was frequently a background and sometimes a foreground concern.\n\nThe difficulty, of course, is extrapolating from \"lists of herbs in a 15C vernacular manual translated from a 12C Latin text carried over from a 9C Arab author.\" It's easy to say vernacular puts it closer to actual practice, since women were the drivers of vernacular literacy in the later Middle Ages, but the clear lines of reference to older academic tradition make those connections somewhat questionable.\n\nThere is, however, ample court evidence to show that medical practitioners below the elite university physician level were indeed suppliers of birth control and abortifacient herbs. Anna Harding of Eichstatt is a fascinating case. She was accused of witchcraft in 1618. Legal records mention her as a provider of herbs to provoke menses (there's that language)--but that's not why she's in legal trouble! Intriguingly, Harding claimed that her potions--herbs mixed into liquid, a common type of remedy--could control menses altogether, whether that meant start, stop, reduce the flow, or even treat other conditions that might be causing the problem. (Incidentally, Harding uses herbal terms in her interrogation record, or at least the terms that are recorded, that don't match up with Riddle's lists as far as I can determine.)\n\nAnother option for birth control was sexual practices. This is a *really* touchy subject in medieval sources. In canon law and the tradition of confessor's manuals, the language can get pretty explicit. (\"Ask him, if he has inserted his member into the holes in a board...\") But like the penitential referenced earlier, scholars debate whether these lists of sins for priests to ask their penitents about were actually ever used. If nothing else, they are a great guide to the celibate clerical...imagination. Yeah, definitely all in the imagination.\n\nRuth Mazo Karras' fantastic study of prostitution in late medieval England, on the other hand, turned up one in/famous court case that seems to suggest [sexual intercourse beyond PIV](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4cpy2c/nsfw_how_did_prostitutes_in_brothels_non_get/d1kg6sj) was an important and widely accepted means of birth control. John (!) Rykener was a cross-dressing prostitute hauled into court. He claimed that none of his customers were ever the wiser about his being male. Many interpretations take this to mean intercrural or anal intercourse, the knowledge of both of which is attested in normative religious sources.\n\nOne other option that I find fascinating is the potential use of breastfeeding as birth control. Although it's not absolute, breastfeeding can extend a woman's period of post-birth infertility. There is some evidence from both Christian and Jewish communities that some mothers sought to extend the time of breastfeeding a little bit longer than was typically prescribed. This is a particularly fruitful use of comparative Christian/Jewish studies. One of the phenomena that Elisheva Baumgarten uncovered was that, in contrast (or resulting in) statutes against Jewish and Christian women breastfeeding across religious boundaries, neighbors used to *swap off* breastfeeding duties to allow Jewish women to keep the Sabbath and Christian women to fast properly.\n\nThere was certainly plenty of \"mercenary\" wet nursing in the Middle Ages, especially in Italy and among noblewomen. Although that second group merits a, well, second glance. For war, politics, family, compatibility, and sundry reasons, it was not the most unusual of circumstances for noble wives and husbands to spend months and years apart. See, of course, the dangers of pre/extramarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which might kick the bucket further down the road rather than actually *solve* problems, but it does help explain why, given the pressures frequently on nobles to have the more offspring the better, there were so many families that had small numbers of legitimate children (even accounting for infant mortality--it's so sad to find mentions of unnamed children in chronicle accounts and letters...).\n\nAnd one more point is worth mentioned. Canon (Church) law sources and the lay people who wielded them in court reflect a persistent, deep-rooted fear that (primarily) women are using magic to render men impotent. So even while the writers of romances concocted love potions for their heroes and heroines to drink, clerics had a very different obsession.\n\nMedieval women, sometimes with the cooperation of their male partners, certainly had options when it came to attempting to prevent pregnancy. All signs suggest that many women sought to utilize them--sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently; sometimes successfully, sometimes not so much.\n\n**Further reading:**\n\n* For THE CHART, see James Brundage, *Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe*\n* Ruth Mazo Karras, *Common Women: Prostitution and Sexuality in Medieval England*\n* Elisheva Baumgarten, *Mothers and Children: Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe*\n* John Riddle, *Conception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance*\n* Ulinka Rublack, *The Crimes of Women in Early Modern Germany*\n* Margaret Brannan Lewis, *Infanticide and Abortion in Early Modern Germany*\n* Dyan Elliott, *Spiritual Marriages: Sexual Abstinence in Medieval Wedlock*\n* Catherine Rider, *Magic and Impotence in the Middle Ages*</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Sid_Burn's answer is great. \n\nJust want to add that it also VERY much depends on the year.   The regime radicalized after 1936, and especially after 1939/40.  And this meant that commandants, police supervisors, etc., who may have been more \"legalistic\" and kept a fairly tight reign over their men--not uncommon in 1934--were often eased out, replaced by more radical (and brutal) officials in the late '30s, and especially after the war began.   Some of this radicalization was due to the internal politics of the SS, under Himmler. \n\nBut most importantly, as the complexion of the camps changed, so too did the \"allowable\" treatment of prisoners change. \n\nTo give a famous example:  Dachau. \nDachau was established right after Hitler came to power, in 1933.  Originally, in 1933-34, it held mostly socialists and communists (rounded up after the Reichstag Fire, in a massive purge of the left.)  Many of these Socialists were only interned in Dachau for a few months--they were released (with the threat of a return always hanging over their heads, ensuring their good behavior). \n\nAfter 1936, more so-called \"undesirables\" were sent there, such as homosexuals, criminals, vagrants & beggars (rounded up during the pre-Olympics sweep), and Jehovah's witnesses.  These non-political prisoners made up more than 50% of the camp population by 1936;  they were generally NOT released, and treatment of them was far harsher. \n\nIn 1938, in the days after the mass-arrests Krystalnacht, 30,000 Jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps;  many Jews ended up in Dachau.  \n\nHere's the thing:  \nIn Dachau, in the mid-1930s, the official number of deaths (caveat:  the OFFICIAL, i.e. SS-recorded deaths) were about 40 people a year, with the causes listed from disease or \"shot while trying to escape.\"  Many of these deaths were sheer brutality--prisoners beaten to death, though this was usually not listed as the cause.  \nBut after Jews arrived in Dachau in large numbers in 1938, this number jumped to about 2,000 in 1939. (with the same alleged reasons for death--disease, escape attempts--listed).  \n\nClearly, as the camp makeup changed (from political prisoners, to \"undesirables\", to Jews) treatment of prisoners became harsher and more lethal. \n\nAfter 1940 or so, of course, everything changes again, as Jewish prisoners were deported in large numbers to ghettos and (after 1941) death camps in Poland. \n\nAnd conditions in (and treatment of prisoners in) camps in Germany also became far, far worse after 1940.  \n\nOne of the other commenters used Mauthausen, in Austria, as a prime example of this\u2026 from a work-camp in 1938, to a brutal work-camp in 1941, to a brutal work-camp that, by 1944, so starved its prisoners to death, that it might as well be considered an extermination camp in all but name and method (namely, starvation instead of firing squads or gas chambers).  \n\nClearly, the \"rules\" (especially the unwritten rules of what was allowable or desirable) changed dramatically over time. \n\nEdit:  grammar</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Ok, so initially there's a bit of a grey area when you talk about \"liberated,\" because liberation wasn't something that happened overnight.  Camps were liberated at different times, and in some cases retreating Nazi forces made deliberate efforts to clean out the camps or prisoners prior to surrendering them. Allied liberated camps had different outcomes than soviet camps etc. \n\nBecause it's the easiest example, imagine you were a jewish man at Buchenwald or the Ohrdruf sub-camp, one of the earlier camps liberated by the allies.    The easiest thing to do is just walk you through the rough timeline. \n\nAllied forces take control of the Buchenwald camp on April 5, 1945 after german forces retreat from the area. \n \nBased on numerous concerns, Allied military officers have inmates of the camp stay \"incarcerated.\" until they can be medically stabalized and a determination can be made on what to do with them.  The allies do bring in medical personnel and food supplies to begin treating the prisoners. For the first several weeks, hundreds of prisoners would continue to die daily.  Gradually conditions improved in the camps, although only to a point. \n\n\n For our hypothetical prisoner from Buchenwald, you probably continue to live at Buchenwald for another 2-3 months perhaps, being fed allied military rations and being treated by allied doctors. you'll slowly regain some semblance of health  \n\nAfter the war ended the Allied Command faced the monumental task of repatriating some 7 million displaced persons within Europe. This included both Ethnic Germans that had settled in other parts of Europe as well as concentration camp survivors, refugees and others.  Allied policy was generally to attempt to repatriate as many of these persons as possible.   However, because the task could not be accomplished instantly, [displaced persons camps were established in europe](http://www.dpcamps.org/dpcampseurope.html) these were refugee camps intended to house displaced persons, which included holocaust survivors as well as eastern Europeans.  \n\nOn October 1, 1945, the [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Relief_and_Rehabilitation_Administration) is formally given legal control over the displaced persons program. However, the UNRRA is widely seen as having been under-staffed and under funded, and conditions in DP camps often were poor at best. \n  \n Based on allied and UNRRA policy, once you were healthy, would be moved to a \"displaced persons\" camp to be repatriated to your country of origin probably sometime between July and November 1945.   If you were Jewish you would most likely be moved into a camp in the US controlled section of occupied germany.  The UNRRA to avoid charges of discrimination, specifically [did not create any special policies towards jewish displaced persons](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/usarmy_holo.html)   However, this was later changed and jewish survivors were given some special accomodations in terms of being grouped together. \n\nThose displaced persons would could be repatriated (germans, western europeans,  and the like) were quickly repatriated, leaving the bulk of the persons in DP camps to be eastern Europeans (Poles, Ukranians etc) and jews who could not be repatriated to their countries of origin.   Particularly if you were from an area that was now occupied by the Russians, you aren't likely to be forced to return. \n\nRather, you will have at least a temporarily uncertain future, and will continue to live in the displaced persons camp in occupied germany for a number of months or years.   You are likely living in housing built by the US military or UNRRA, and fed by either US military or UNRRA personnel.  Conditions are poor at best, and downright abysmal at worst, with refugees living in cramped overcrowded housing and being fed insufficient food. \n\nGradually, private aid agencies will step in to provide solutions to the problems, but they had limited impact. Many of these private aid agencies were juewish centric agencies. \n\n\nConditions were made worse by further refugees fleeing soviet bloq countries. Between 1945 and 1948 there was an even larger percentage of Jewish refugees coming into DP camps, to the point where in 1948, an allied military commander closed the borders to further refugees, although the orders were not ironclad and many continued to come.   [This is a review of a book on the refugee crisis after WWII in general](http://www.salon.com/2011/03/01/the_long_road_home_ben_shephard/) \n\nAt this point, you get along basically in a similar way as any other refugee anywhere gets along.  Black market Micro-economies spring up in refugee camps based both on rations and on markets within the camps themselves. Cigarettes and Chocolate and rations are common currencies. If you have a marketable skill you perhaps try to earn some side income.  Prostitution was not an uncommon source of income.  You rely on others in the camp and established new networks for support.  \n\nOver time, many left the camps, but opportunities were somewhat limited and covert. Jewish groups started moving jewish residents into Israel at this point, but due to a British prohibition on settlement on palestine they often had to be smuggled (although, much like today, it was not terribly difficult). \n\nThe big sea change was in May  1948, two significant things happened \n\n1. [the US senate passed the  Wiley-Revercomb  Displaced Persons Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displaced_Persons_Act) this allowed 100,000 displaced persons to gain permanent residence in the United States. \n\n2. In may 1948 the state of Israel was established, and immigration was opened to every person of Jewish Descent. (the return act wasn't formally passed until 1950, but once Israel was recognized, people could travel there openly) About 130,000 remaining displaced persons emigrated to Israel within the first three years of Israeli statehood, many were assisted by Zionist groups. \n\n\n\nAgain, for our hypothetical resident from Buchenwald, you've probably moved to a DP camp somewhere in the American Zone of Germany. You have limited opportunity and limited resources. Perhaps if you can find gainful employment, or have family somewhere, you've gotten out before now, but if you truly have nothing, you're probably still in a DP camp by 1947 or early 1948. \n\nAt this point, options become available. Per the above, you can scrounge together whatever savings you can beg, borrow and steal, and try to apply for a US visa and get on a boat to New York, or you can go to a Zionist group, and they will arrange for transport to the newly formed state of Israel. By the late 1940's to 1950, most of the camps had been emptied. \n\n \n\n\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I'll recommend Keith Lowe's *Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II* in answering this question. It's written more toward a popular audience and is a good general history of the period and conditions in question. More specifically on this topic, I'd also recommend Henry Feingold's *Bearing Witness: How America and Its Jews Responded to the Holocaust*, and the U.S. Holocaust Museum's ample and well-written articles. I'm going to draw upon these sources and the works published by the U.S. Army's Center of Military History. \n\nThe answer to your question **depends on where the person falls on the Western Allied/Soviet occupation line.** On the eastern side of the line, the Soviet Union had been wracked by five years of war and was ill-suited to care for millions of external refugees. European Russia had been devastated by the war, and the primary postwar concern of the Soviet Union was matters within its borders. On the western side of the line, the Western Allies were better-equipped to cope with the millions of refugees created by the war, though they faced their own significant problems.\n\nThe term used again and again in contemporary accounts is \"Displaced Persons,\" or DPs. As the final weeks and months of the war ticked down and camps were liberated, the first priority was to care for the survivors and bury the dead. In some cases, these survivors were kept near the camps in order to provide for concentrated care. Once healthy enough to move, many camp survivors simply left and tried to make their way home. This was an extraordinarily difficult and trying process, as millions of other Europeans were doing the same. \n\nBy July 1, [according to the U.S. Army history of the occupation of Germany](http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/occ-gy/ch16.htm) (p. 290), 1.39 million Soviet citizens alone had gone east from the Western-occupied sectors of Germany. The Soviet forces, in the same period, had delivered 300,000 Western European DPs and prisoners of war. There were millions of Germans on the roads, too, leaving destroyed homes, returning home after being demobilized, or simply trying to find food.\n\nThe responsibility of caring for these millions of DPs (as compared to prisoners of war, who were treated separately) fell upon [the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005685), which was created in 1943. If you're interested, [you can watch a 1944 newsreel on the administration here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W1Pu1NWoWo). The UNRRA operated hundreds of camps across Germany and the rest of Western Europe.\n\nThe original intent of the camps was to unite families, and repatriate people back to their home countries. A Frenchman forced to work in Germany might go to a camp for immediate shelter and feeding, and once his needs were met, would be able to send letters or messages back to France to ensure he had a place to go, whether to his home or to the home of a family member.\n\nInitially, Jews were placed into this system alongside non-Jews. There was no distinction between Holocaust survivors and other refugees. This, of course, posed problems, since many of the refugees were Germans and others who had strong antisemitic views untouched by the end of the war. Word of the poor treatment of Holocaust survivors reached President Harry Truman, who ordered the separation of Jews and non-Jews starting in 1945. \n\nHow could they tell, you ask? Well, antisemitism was still strong, and few people were going around pretending to be Jews. DPs who lacked family nearby still had friends made in the camps or on the road who could vouch for each other. Furthermore, if there was any doubt about someone's status, they could simply be quizzed about Jewish traditions and practices.\n\nStarting in fall 1945, private Jewish relief organizations were permitted to operate in UNRRA camps alongside the regular infrastructure. The biggest of these was the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, which had been formed to support Eastern European Jews during WWI. As the Holocaust Museum's article states cogently and clearly:\n\n>\"After the war, the JDC\u2014working together with the Jewish Agency for Palestine, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), and other organizations\u2014became the central Jewish agency providing support and financial assistance to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust residing in the displaced persons (DP) camps in Germany, Austria, and Italy. The JDC provided food to augment official rations, supplied clothing, books, and school supplies for children, supported cultural amenities, and bought religious supplies for the community. Between 1945 and 1950 alone, some 420,000 Jews in Eastern Europe become beneficiaries of the [JDC], which spent over 300 million dollars on assistance and sent an army of professionals (doctors, nurses, teachers, social workers, and administrators) to serve the needs of approximately 700,000 people each month\u2014both in and outside of the DP apparatus.\"\n\nWhere did people go once leaving the camps? It depended upon their personal preference. Many survivors didn't want to return home because their property had been entirely destroyed or confiscated, or because there was still significant antisemitism. Even if it wasn't explicit \u2500 would you want to live next to neighbors who had acquiesced in your attempted murder? Sometimes, conditions were even worse. In 1946, the residents of Kielce, Poland, [\"murdered at least 42 Jews and injured over 40 in the worst outburst of anti-Jewish violence in postwar Poland.\"](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007941)\n\nAs Lowe writes, \"Jews of all nationalities would discover that the end of German rule did not mean the end of persecution. Far from it. Despite all that the Jews had suffered, in many areas anti-Semitism would increase after the war. Violence against Jews would resurface everywhere \u2500 even in places that had never been occupied, such as Britain.\"\n\nIn Holland, France and Italy, Lowe explains, Jewish refugees returning home were treated the same as other refugees. \"On arrival in the city's central station they were interviewed, registered, and given ration cards and clothing coupons. Sometimes they were given advice on where to stay, or where to find help, but sometimes the desks of the various aid agencies were unattended,\" he writes on page 193.\n\nThis equal treatment disregarded the fact that Jewish communities had been utterly destroyed throughout Europe, and that there were few social networks left for the survivors. Rebuilding those was a titanic task, and while other survivors might have friends and family to lean upon, that was rarely the case. Furthermore, other survivors didn't tend to endure the outright plundering and repossession of property that took place among Holocaust victims. In many cases, it was easier to simply emigrate and start over, rather than try to rebuild in place.\n\nThe United States accepted some Jewish refugees, but not many. Numbers were kept low until the 1948 Displaced Persons Act, and in that same year, the creation of Israel allowed another formal conduit for Jewish refugees. Before that year, emigration to Israel was largely illegal, but it continued anyway and was encouraged by many European nations that publicly announced that they would not stop it. Great Britain, which feared Jewish-Palestinian conflict, tried to stand in the way with formal restrictions, so most migration was done covertly through organizations like the *Brichah,* which also operated human-smuggling operations across borders throughout Europe, Lowe writes.\n\nIronically, Lowe explains, the flight of Jews from eastern Europe through the DP camps and on to Palestine finished the work of the Holocaust and made Europe much more *Judenfrei* than it had been at the end of the war.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>We've learned such a huge amount of things, both large and small, that I'm sure I'm going to forget a number of them. But here goes:\n\n1) On the most macro level, the earliest complete Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible that we have are in the Leningrad Codex of 1008 CE, which was copied closer to us than to the original creation of the Bible. Our closest complete copy in another language (Greek) is in the Codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, which are from the around the 4th-5th centuries CE. Questions started popping up regarding the reliability of the Bible\u2013\u2013if all our Bibles are using a Hebrew translation that dates to a thousand years ago, and the text was originally written between ~2150-3000 years ago, how are we to know that we're even reading the right thing?\n\nWhen the Scrolls were discovered and dated (using Paleography, C-14, and Mass Spectrometry) to between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century CE (some are older, some newer), we were finally able to see if the text we had was relatively reliable. In most cases, on the macro scale, it is. There are a ton of minor textual variants (sentences, words, etc.), but you won't see the copies of Exodus saying that Pharaoh actually killed Moses and led the people out of Israel himself, if you catch my meaning. So on that level, we learned a lot about the transmission of the Bible.\n\n2) We learned a ton about the variants of Second Temple Jews. While there's still scholarly debate on who exactly wrote the Scrolls (another question for another time), the general consensus is that it was the Essenes, of whom Josephus spoke. With the discovery of the Community Rule document, we got the smallest details of the way these people operated, including their initiation rites, their day to day rules, the way they used their money, and the way they interacted with each other.\n\n3) The Scrolls have been a huge discovery in terms of the development of canon. For those who say the canon was closed since its original creation, the Scrolls have both supported some of their claims and muddied up the waters a bit. In terms of supporting the canon, we see that, as far back as the 3rd-2nd century BCE, the general outline of the Hebrew Bible was similar to today. They had the \"writings of Moses\" (Pentateuch), \"The Prophets\" (the major and minor prophets of our Bible), and the \"Writings\" (Wisdom literature and other assorted things like Job). We also have scrolls that contain both Genesis and Exodus, others with Exodus and Leviticus, Leviticus and Numbers, Numbers and Deuteronomy, so we know that they were thought of as a unit at that time. We also know that these books, along with the Psalms, were the most important to this group: there are about 40 copies of Psalms, 35 of Genesis, and similar amounts for the others, followed by a sizeable drop off when it comes to other books. For instance, there's only one of Ezra, none of Esther, and many others in the single digits.\n\nHow did it muddy up the canon? Among the most frequently found books are the Book of Jubilees and the Book of Enoch, indicating that these, too, were considered sacred, and more sacred than the majority of non-Pentateuchal books. Their writings frequently invoke ideas from the Book of Enoch and the book of Jubilees, and their calendar seemed to run by that of Jubilees.\n\n4) We discovered a number of methods of biblical interpretation that are extremely interesting, and predate Midrash and Talmud. One method is the Pesher, in which verses from the Bible are laid out and the interpreter writes, one by one, how each verse applies to their modern situation (they were heavy into eschatology, believing there was going to be a massive war between the forces of good and evil). The other was in the form of pseudepigrapha\u2013stories written from the point of view of a famous biblical character, that retell or expand on their story in order to smooth out some issues with the text. For a good example, I'd suggest the Genesis Apocryphon.\n\n5) I don't know quite how to put this next one, except to say that they operated, literarily, in a very bizarre way. Part of the reason that they weren't particularly easy to date was that they never use proper names. They only use code names, and there are a number of characters that show up. Their initial leader, whom they see as something of a prophet, is only known as the Teacher of Righteousness. There's also the Man of the Lie, the Wicked Priest (his enemy), Those Who Speak Smooth Things, and a number of others that I can't recall offhand. The Teacher of Righteousness is thought to have written a number of the nonbiblical scrolls, most notably the Thanksgiving Hymns, which are a collection of really beautiful psalm-style poems. I really suggest reading them.\n\n6) For Christians who are interested in the context that Jesus came out of, the Scrolls set the stage for a lot of things that appear in the New Testament. The New Jerusalem Text and Temple Scroll will remind you of Revelation, and a number of narrative devices (\"fount of living water\" for one) will look familiar. That's NOT to say that the Dead Sea sect were early Christians, or that Jesus was an Essene (though some people have argued weakly), but it simply shows some context. Personally, given the style and the narrative devices, I do think that Johannine christianity may have come out of a Jewish context that had some kind of influence from this group (for more on that, you can read a number of books and conference proceedings on Qumran and John), though that's as far as I'll go on that matter.\n\nI'm missing a million things here. We learned so many little things from the Dead Sea Scrolls, along with the big things, that it literally takes whole books to explain. The best book, easiest to understand, that I've come across is The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, by Flint and Vanderkam. That's where I got all of this information.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: Minor textual changes, just like the Scrolls themselves.\n\nEdit 2: Bonus fun fact: if you're looking for a very specific example of something that we didn't know that we know now, here's one. There's a moment in 1 Samuel 11, in which a character behaves very strangely. Nahash the Ammonite makes peace with the Israelites, and one verse later gouges out everyone's right eye for seemingly no reason. This has puzzled a lot of commentators. However, scroll 4QSam-a (4=Cave 4, Q=Qumran, Sam=Samuel, a=fragment A) has an additional verse that explains Nahash's behaviour (though he still comes off as a horrible tyrant): he liked gouging people's eyes out and the Israelites had escaped and conglomerated in the city that he oppresses in the following verse. Now, the NRSV translation, which is the one used by most academic scholars, includes that verse that was originally missing. So that's a very tangible example of things we learn from the Scrolls for you.\n\nEdit 3: Thanks for the gold! Y'all know how to make a poor grad student feel special!</p>",

I'll come back and fill this out more later. \n\nFirst and foremost, the DSS are the oldest extant manuscripts of the texts of the Hebrew Bible. There are also a slew of sectarian documents that deal with (most likely) the life of the community of Jews who lived at Qumran. \n\nSo what did we learn? First, we gained a great deal more insight into the practice of Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible. We discovered a vast number of new textual variants (and even in some cases, like that of the book of Jeremiah, we discovered wholly distinct versions of some books). One of my favorite examples comes from one of the Deuteronomy scrolls (I can't remember the call name off the top of my head - perhaps 4QDeut^j EDIT: I was right! http://ohb.berkeley.edu/Deut%2032%20sample.pdf). In this particular example, Deut 32:8-9, an old poem about Canaanite deities, Elyon (\"the Most High\") is dividing up the land and doling it out to junior deities, of which Yahweh is one. In the scroll, we are told that Elyon is dividing up the people's according to the \"sons of God.\" The Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible says \"sons of Israel\" here. The reading \"sons of god\" makes much better sense in context and so we can see that someone changed the poem at some point as a function of their monotheistic piety. \n\nAdditional information added to my original comment:\n\nBasically, we learned a great deal about the development of many of the texts composing the Hebrew Bible canon. We learned more about how at least one sectarian community maintained several different traditions of some texts, we learned that they even used older forms of the Hebrew script (e.g., 4QPalaeoExod). We learned that were comfortable with a pluriformity of text types. \n\nDouble Ninja Edit, now with sources!!\n\nSo if you want to READ THE SCROLLS! check out [*The Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition*](http://www.brill.com/dead-sea-scrolls-study-edition-2-vols). \n\nIf you want a history of their discovery and scholarship, check out Lawrence Schiffman's *Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls*. \n\nIf you want to check out some of the scrolls online! go here: http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive\n\nBrill has a series of Dead Sea Scrolls Readers that are really great (albeit pricey). \n\nJodi Magness is the renown archaeologist for Kh.

                "answer": "<p>The Nazis essentially did mental gymnastics to avoid the Jewish roots of Christianity (and of course, the Nazi's relationship with Christianity can be an entire new question to be covered). Perhaps the most absurd way that they tackled this was through the claim that \"Jesus was not a Jew\". Rather, they claimed (although not an original idea to them specifically) he was of Aryan descent, paternally descended from members of the Roman Legion who had come to the region. The roots of this theory come from the [tradition](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5nr9nf/how_did_nazi_or_any_antisemetic_christians_view/dcea8k8?context=3) that Jesus was, in the words of Hitler, the product of \"a whore and a Roman soldier\", but other theorists changed the generation and noted his grandfather to have been the Legionnaire. The inseey-weensy tiny detail that, you know, the whole point is that Jesus is the son of God, and has no earthly father, is elided over. Anyways though, his Jewish roots dispensed with, Jesus can now be set up as an anti-Jewish crusader, as described here by Hitler:\n\n>For the Galilean's object was to liberate His country from Jewish oppression. He set Himself against Jewish capitalism, and that's why the Jews liquidated Him.\n\nThe 'perversion' of Jesus' doctrine is laid at the feet of Paul, a 'sick brain', for \"purposes of personal exploitation\", what he terms at a different time \"mobilis[ing] the criminal underworld [to] organise a proto-Bolshevism\". During his monologue, Hitler goes further, contrasting the Romans and the Jews:\n\n>The religious ideas of the Romans are common to all Aryan peoples. The Jew, on the other hand, worshipped and continues to worship, then and now, nothing but the golden calf. The Jewish religion is devoid of all metaphysics and has no foundation but the most repulsive materialism. That's proved even in the concrete representation they have of the Beyond-\u2014 which for them is identified with Abraham's bosom\n\nCircumscribing the Jewishness of \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u200e and attempting to Aryanize the origins of Christianity is only part of it. At a later meeting, Hitler focuses his tirade on the Bible, and the Old Testament:\n\n>It is a great pity that this tendency towards religious thought can find no better outlet than the Jewish [pettifoggery](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pettifoggery) of the Old Testament. For religious people who, in the solitude of winter, continually seek ultimate light on their religious problems with the assistance of the Bible, must eventually become spiritually deformed. The wretched people strive to extract truths from these Jewish chicaneries, where in fact no truths exist. As a result they become embedded in some rut of thought or other and, unless they possess an exceptionally commonsense mind, degenerate into religious maniacs.\n\nI think that it is laid out pretty clear here as to his views of the Old Testament - although his view of the Paul-corrupted , namely that they were slightly negative! Late in this particular discourse, he also calls it \"Jewish filth and priestly twaddle\" and \" Jewish mumbo jumbo\", and also laments that the Bible was ever translated into German, noting:\n\n>So long as the wisdom, particularly of the Old Testament, remained exclusively in the Latin of the Church, there was little danger that sensible people would become the victims of illusions as the result of studying the Bible.\n\nNow of course, Hitler, while his opinion is perhaps more powerful a voice that any other, is not the only one to look at, and you find this anti-Old Testament sentiment expressed elsewhere. Rheinhold Krause, a German Christian movement leader and Nazi, for instance, was unabashed in his views that Martin Luther's work remained 'unfinished' and that there remained work to be done, namely the completion of the Germanization of the Church, which included elimination of any remaining Jewish influence, and that explicitly included the Old Testament, as well as, previously noted, the influence of Paul. Perhaps one of the few *values* that the German Christians found in the Jewish tomes was that, for a commited anti-Semite, it stood as illustration of \"the inability of the Jews to live up to God\u2019s expectations.\" During his 1933 speech at the Berlin Sportpalast, it was under the demand:\n\n>Away with the Old Testament! A Christianity which still clings to the Old Testament is a Jewish Religion, irreconcilable with the spirit of the German people.\n\nHe was hardly alone in his voice. In 1933, Reich\u2018s Bishop Ludwig M\u00fcller proclaimed similarly that \"We must emphasize with all decisiveness that Christianity did not grow out of Judaism but developed in opposition to Judaism\", and in the 1939 Godesberg Declaration of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, it was stated:\n\n>Did Christianity arise out of Judaism being thus its continuation and completion, or does it stand in opposition to Judaism? To this question we respond: Christian faith is the unbridgeable religious contradiction to Judaism.\n\nNow, to be sure, the German Christian movement, which was intimately tied into the racist voelkish movement, didn't speak for all Christians who were German. The Confessing Church, German Protestants who were opposed to growing Nazi influence within the Church in Germany, rejected such a platform and would continue to use the Christian scripture as before, although they couldn't avoid being caught up in the debate, and having to defend their choice. For those Germans who did ascribe to the effort to 'de-Judaize' Christianity, they would publicly smear the Confessing Church as \"nothing but diluted Judaism\u201d. This in turn lead to attempts to defend the \"Germanness\" of the Old Testament, which came in various forms. One popular vein was to focus on Luther's anti-Semitism, and thus argue that if the Old Testament was *truely* Jewish, Luther would have rejected it. Volkmar Hentrich further argued in his 1935 defense that:\n\n>when one considers the zeal with which the ancient Germanics embraced the Old Testament with its stories of war, heroes and an all-powerful God who easily defeats his enemies in battle (1935, p 396). And given the Germanic nature of the Old Testament, a German can read it without fear of being \u201cJudaized.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, some people out and out rejected either the rejection or the \"Germanization\", but anyone who did so publicly, of course, was standing in stark opposition to the regime. Writing in 1934, Wilhelm Vischer's \"The Old Testament Witness to Christ\" was perhaps the most public example of this, where he wrote a stirring defense that \u201cthe Christian Church stands or falls with the recognition of the unity of both Testaments\u201d and used the Old Testament stories to make a statement directly in opposition to the Nazis. It perhaps goes without saying that Vischer eventually fled Germany, settling in Switzerland where he worked as an anti-Nazi activist and headed the \"Club of Friends of Israel\u201d.\n\nSo hopefully that lays things out for you. The Old Testament absolutely presented a conundrum for the Nazis, and to solve it, basically, you see several strains in varying degrees of extremity, from those who adamantly rejected *all* Jewish influence of Christianity and attempted to give it German/Aryan origins, through those attempting to manage a synthesis, to the other end where people like Vischer or Karl Barth were not afraid to call out such actions.\n\n---------\n\nSources:\n\nDean Garrett Stroud (2002) Reading the Old Testament in the Third Reich, Journal of Genocide Research, 4:2, 253-260\n\nHitler, Adolf, Norman Cameron, R.

                "answer": "<p>The Nazi party had a pretty dim view of the Old Testament and the text underwent a fair bit of religious and social re-interpretation during the Nazi era.  Later on, of course, even Christianity would come under attack by the Nazi state with an attempt to subvert much of German Christianity with a German Evangelical Church (Deutsche Evangelische Kirche) or \"Reich Church\" -- so named because it was an official religious organ of the state. \n\nThere's a pretty decent article by Doris L Bergen of the University of Toronto (formerly Notre Dame) up at [BibleInterp.com](http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/bergen_033001.shtml) which, while I wouldn't ordinarily recommend as a secondary or tertiary source, is reasonably scholarly in this context.  \n\nThe short version is that a significant chunk of the Nazi party bristled at the thought of, as Reinhold Krause put it, \"accept[ing] from the Jew anything that speaks to our soul, to our most intimate religious essence,\" characterizing the Old Testament as \"stories of pimps and cattle traders.\"\n\nOf course it's not just that the Old Testament *follows* Jewish history; it elevates it.  The Jews are, after all, described as God's \"chosen people.\"  \n\nLike many aspects of Nazi propaganda, however, the hatred of the Jewish people simply coexisted mutely alongside transparent references to stories of Jewish figures in the Old Testament.  Hitler himself is easily enough cast in the role of Moses, delivering the German people from the wilderness of the post-WWI economic catastrophe into the promised lind of a thousand year Reich. He even appropriates the language of a \"chosen people\" in Mein Kampf, though of course the German people are \"chosen by fate\" rather than the Abrahamic God.\n\nIndeed, while Germany held most strongly to Christianity -- of the three major monotheistic faiths -- that does not mean that Nazism as an ideology was at all rooted in or accepting of Christianity (and thus the Old Testament).  German even has a word _Kirchenkampf_ (loosely: \"Church Struggle\") to represent this tension between the Nazi state and the religious institutions of Germany.  From 1933 until the fall of the Reich, the Nazi party attempted to curtail the independence of the Churches and supplant traditional symbols of the faith with symbols of the state.  This culminated in the 1944 coup attempt, motivated by [Christian conscience](https://books.google.com/books/about/Plotting_Hitler_s_Death.html?id=A5KtmvNoRjcC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false) (among other things) and, upon its failure, the execution of Bonhoffer in 1945.  As Hitler's deputy, Martin Bormann wrote \"[National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable](https://books.google.com/books?id=jPckDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA440&lpg=PA440&dq=National+Socialism+and+Christianity+are+irreconcilable&source=bl&ots=u3wwhfCpTP&sig=c2BXrS4QBHNRCAkx-czGhgSZ5kM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRisKV_L_RAhVCJCYKHbppCcwQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&q=National%20Socialism%20and%20Christianity%20are%20irreconcilable&f=false).\"  </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Awesome question. The classic answer can be found in Richard Hofstadter's 1963 book, *Anti-Intellectualism in American Life*. Hofstadter, who went on to win the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction for the book, wrote:\n\n>\"Anti-intellectualism . . . is founded in the democratic institutions and the egalitarian sentiments of this country.\"\n\nFor Hofstadter, who traces anti-intellectualism to broadsheets levied against some of the first American presidential candidates, the roots go to the classic American debate between who governs best. Is it the mob, the vast majority of Americans who have little interest or knowledge in a topic, or is it a smaller and traditionally less representative group of people who have more experience and education on a topic?\n\nAs Woodrow Wilson said in 1912: \"What I fear is a government of experts. God forbid that in a democratic country we should resign the task and give the government over to experts. What are we for if we are to be scientifically taken care of by a small number of gentlemen who are the only men who understand the job?\"\n\nHofstadter is still quoted frequently on this topic, but there are a lot of things he missed discussing, as Nicholas Lemann points out [in a wonderful 50th anniversary retrospective review](http://www.cjr.org/second_read/richard_hofstadter_tea_party.php).\n\nHofstadter (and plenty of people today) think of anti-intellectualism as solely the domain of the political right. But Hofstadter missed people like Donald Kagan, Robert Bork, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Allan Bloom, who wrote *The Closing of the American Mind.*\n\nHe also tended to describe business as anti-intellectual, when we know that today, business is one of the most intellectual-friendly branches of American society. America today hosts designers and inventors, innovators and trend-makers, rather than industrialists and manufacturers as it did in 1963, when Hofstadter was writing.\n\nHe also missed the rise of the Civil Rights movement for women and minorities in the United States.\n\nThat's getting a little off track, however. The bottom line is that there is (and has been) a constant push-pull between appeals to the \"mob\" and the \"elite\" in American society.\n\nIn *Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic,* Gordon Wood contends that the first 30 years of the United States resulted in a switch from the desires of the nation's founders \u2500 who were the elite of the nation \u2500 to the will of the middling people, those involved in commerce and enterprise.\n\nThe founders of the United States had envisioned a Congress and President who were already wealthy and thus immune from corruption. The thought went that they would be self-sacrificing and put aside their businesses to serve the national good for a period, then return to their own interests afterward. \n\nJoyce Appleby and Wood contend that the middle classes, who enriched themselves through industry and enterprise, developed a belief that the self-made man was the ideal politician, not someone who had been born wealthy, was educated, and thus theoretically could be trusted to make a decision without being swayed by public opinion.\n\nAnd so we have a push and pull, dating back to the roots of the United States.\n\nHofstadter also makes the case that evangelical Protestantism in the United States, particularly in the South, strongly contributed to anti-intellectualism in the latter half of the 19th century and the 20th century. Mark Noll's *The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind* is a more in-depth analysis of this aspect.\n\nNoll has done some excellent work on American religious history (I highly recommend his *The Civil War as a Theological Crisis*) and he explains that a lot of the American evangelical anti-intellectualism can be traced back to the development of a \"literalist\" interpretation of the Bible as a response to the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century. Before the 19th century, and particularly before the French Revolution, churches and religious organizations tended to be pro-science if they were anything. \n\nIn the United States, this began to change as the arguments about slavery intensified. As Noll points out, the Civil War caused many churches to fission into southern and northern branches, based upon their beliefs in slavery. Northern churches tended to favor an interpretation-based view of the Bible, while Southern churches stuck with a much more literal interpretation of the Bible. Forex, since the Bible refers to slavery and the proper treatment of slaves, it must be appropriate to have slavery in the United States, they argued.\n\nThis literalist philosophy was later applied to things as varied as racial segregation, abortion, and global warming. Because of its reliance upon scripture as the absolute (literally Gospel) truth, anything that took a different viewpoint was seen in a dim light.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Okay, I know nothing about admissions to Oxford over the centuries ([but something about them in the Middle Ages](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5d8r64/oxford_university_was_established_c_1096_how_have/da2w7an/)), but let's clear up one thing:\n\n*Oxford was not founded in 1096.*\n\nI know the website says \"there was evidence for teaching at Oxord in 1096.\" Let's talk about what that means, and why Oxford tries to mislead you.\n\nThe modern university system in the west is a creation of the high Middle Ages. The first formal evidence for *universitates* (sing. *universitas*) in Paris, Oxford, and Bologna all date from around 1200. Here, universitas is making the transition from referring to the group of people involved--basically a guild for regulating learning, with teachers as masters and students as apprentices--to the institution. But these universities did not come from nowhere.\n\nIn the eleventh century accelerating into the twelfth, learning in Europe was concentrated in the Church. Monastery schools training primarily their own monks or nuns are the most famous. But priests and minor clergy outside monastic orders also needed training. The system that evolved during these centuries favored individual master teachers with a wide reputation attracting students from their region or even farther away who came to them to study.\n\nThese masters weren't *only* teachers, those. They generally held at least one important benefice (position with income attached, generally in the form of taxes from land that came with the title), and they could move from position to position. Their students would follow.\n\nIn the twelfth century (1080-1215), not only did the number of students and the importance of the schools explode, the city of Paris became a major congregating spot for these intellectual masters and their students. We used to think the same was true of Bologna, specifically. Anders Winroth has recently argued, however, that the masters and the schools that developed around them and followed them around were actually spread throughout northern Italy during the 12th century, not concentrated in Bologna.\n\nWhy the massive increase? Schools were the primary producers of *literati*, that is, people literate in Latin, the language of governance in the West. This was the time when, very very slowly, governments were beginning to make more use of written documents. It was letters of communication and symbolic writing long before it was record-keeping for consultation, but the need for trained writers was growing. At the same time, the growth in government--Church and secular--was spurring stronger interest in organized laws to make governing easier. And Churchmen paying more attention to these ideals of order and analysis, along with a growing realization that the Church needed to reach more levels of the population to survive, spurred a lot more attention to *understanding* theology: to figuring out what, exactly, Christians believed out of a messy mass of theological writings that often disagreed with each other. So the work of the schools was on one hand to study things and produce texts to guide others, and on the other, to produce the clerics--the *clerks*--who would run governments.\n\nThe emphasis on the second of those, and the skyrocketing need to produce ever-more literate clerks and (after 1179, 1200, and *really* after 1215) trained preachers to instruct lay people prompted the establishment of longer-term institutions *not* tied to the whims of an individual master. Hence, after 1200, we start seeing charter (legal documents of land donation), civic law, and other references to formal universities at Paris, Bologna, and Oxford first of all.\n\nNow, here's the thing. There is no \"official founding document\" for any of these, a common medieval situation. It's clear that the universities were *evolutions* out of pre-existing practice. At what point did a group of masters and students become a formal university? It's hard to say.\n\nThat means that Bologna, Paris, and Oxford can all claim to be the oldest university in the west. And guess what--oh, they do, they really do.\n\nYou can find medievalists today who will side with Paris or Bologna (Winroth's article ruffled some feathers among Italianists that I know, but that could be my limited sample), but Oxford's claim is actually the fishiest.\n\nOxford in the 11th century wasn't exactly a backwater, but it was no intellectual center. It made an economic role for itself as a convenient place to cross the Thames, basically, but the diocesan seat--and the well-regarded school that developed around its cathedral--were actually at Lincoln. However, the size and economic interest of Oxford could support a teacher and students. Theobald of Etampes (d. 1125ish) refers to himself as a \"master at Oxford\" in undated letters from around 1100. This is the earliest we hear about *teaching* at Oxford. Not any kind of formal, established school--just a master who had students.\n\nThere are other scattered references to individual masters throughout the twelfth century.  By ~1190, Gerald of Wales gave multiple lectures at Oxford, which he called a great center of learning. Gerald's writing is exceptionally interesting because he indicates that there is already a degree of hierarchy and specialization forming among the schools (which are still being referred to as the \"schools of Oxford,\" plural, in 1197). This means that in the 1190s, some degree of formalization and structure was developing, but we probably can't talk about a *universitas*.\n\nBut that doesn't stop modern pride from writing checks their sources can't cash. G.R. Evans' *University of Oxford: A New History* is a great example. In introduction to the medieval background chapter, she compares Oxford to Bologna/Italy:\n\n> As to law, Irnerius (c.1050-1125) was a Bolognese lawyer who was apparently teaching Roman law at Bologna from the 1070s. Bologna's school was not a real *universitas* yet, merely a superior vocational college. How did scruffy little Oxford emerge at the forefront of this European movement almost as soon as it began?\n\nThe implication is clear. It's only later that Evans admits:\n\n> Twelfth-century students would come [to Oxford] to study with a famous Master (*magister*) or teacher, not in a particular place; if the Master moved on, they would follow...There is no evidence yet of a continuous history or an institutionalized school.\n\nEveryone wants to be first. No one can *prove* for sure who was, however, which allows Bologna, Paris, and Oxford to stake the claim.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>One thing I want to highlight here as someone who regularly answers questions is that answering a question takes time. We usually get one popular thread per day (i.e. one that hits all with 1000+ upvotes) and from my experience, the gap between let's say 350 and 900 upvotes closes very quickly, in the matter of a couple of hours. Provided one user with expertise sees such a thread, it can take a couple of hours to research and write something up (if I am not intimately familiar with a topic but know where I can look it can take me 2-3 hours to write an extensive answer). In that time, a thread can hit all and have already a number of removed comments because people start jumping in with comments like \"Where is the answer?\", \"[removed]\", and \"The Jews are at fault\" (seriously, this happened twice in the last two days).\n\nSo basically by the time, a user with expertise has written an answer, a thread has already exploded and people are up in arms about removed comments. The interesting thing is that few of these threads ever go unanswered (I can think of only two in the last two weeks who didn't get an acceptable answer at some point), so usually it is only a matter of checking a couple of hours later to get an answer.\n\nAnd as someone who answers questions, some of which get popular (Hitler!), rather frequently, such tags would only frustrate me, because an answer tag would probably lead to no one looking at an answer that comes late but that I have put a lot of work in while an unanswered tag would maybe save some people two clicks and three minutes of reading but also make the phenomenon of posts a la \"this has not been answered, so I'll give it a shot\" worse as well as it would not stop the posts complaining why this hasn't been answered yet when it is sitting at all with 900 upvotes.</p>",

Or is the no responses tag placed on a question after comments are removed? The mods already do so much here, it seems like the last thing we should be doing is asking them to do more. But if it's on the question-asker, he or she may not be around for a while after asking the question or may remove the tag after receiving an answer that does not fulfill the requirements for a top-level comment.\n\nWould a post that still has its no responses tag get more attention from potential answerers than a post from which the no responses tag had already been removed?\n\nI'm honestly wondering how OP or others see such a tag working, not trying to find faults with it for fault's sake.

                "answer": "<p>One other practical and intellectual problem with this, along with the others that have been discussed, is who decides when a question has been 'answered' or 'addressed'. And then who decides if it needs to go back to being 'unaddressed'.\n\nA very recent example involving me. [In this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4szdp4/how_did_immigration_work_before_modern_times/?st=iqoyvjzu&sh=de405b70) OP asked about pre-modern immigration. Now, if we had an 'unanswered' or 'unaddressed' tag on threads, it would have been gone by the time I saw the question and clicked on it, because it had already been given a long and detailed answer, which was (seemingly) mod-approved and quickly gathering upvotes. It was, however, wrong, in several important ways. I wrote a nice long post gently correcting the original answer, and the post was subsequently removed. \n\nShould we put the 'unanswered'/'unaddressed' tag back on the thread now? It now consists of my rebuttal of a deleted post (which does add some discussion to OP's questions but also large chunks of other material about slaves and serfs which have nothing to do with the topic) and a discussion of the way in which medieval merchant networks operated (once again spawned by the deleted post). OP's question has not been addressed or answered.\n\nThe other point is, I guess, if the post had been tagged 'addressed' or 'answered', would we discourage people for challenging posts which are accomplished, detailed and eloquent, but ultimately misleading (like I did). Although the majority of the comment graveyards are one-liners and jokes, I've seen plenty of long, earnest and good-faith efforts to answer questions which, for one reason or another, still don't meet the requirements of the sub. These kinds of posts are often initially left up for hours or days, either to allow the poster to respond to questions about sources etc. or until a flair in that particular topic happens to come along and point out the problem. Having a mod-approved answer might well discourage people, especially knowledgeable newcomers or non-flairs from challenging seemingly-competent but actually flawed answers.\n\nIt's certainly a frustrating problem, but given that it takes at most 10 seconds and two clicks to check if a question has a satisfactory response, I think the system we have is probably, on balance, the best we can do for now.</p>",

In the realm of influencing our modern perceptions of pirates (that isn't also technically a period source, that award would go straight to Charles Johnson's General History of Pyrates, 2-volume worked published from 1724-1728), there is almost a tie between Stevenson's book, Howard Pyle's art in the late 19th and early 20th century, and Disney from 1950 on. In Treasure Island, Long John Silver has a parrot called Captain Flint that says \"Pieces of Eight\". Before that, pirates didn't have any particular stereotype for parrots - just like they didn't have any particular stereotype for wooden/missing legs, hooks for hands, or eye patches. Sailors of the Age of Sail were known to occasionally acquire animals in foreign ports through purchase or trade. Some may have kept them as pets for themselves, but at least with the case of parrots, they were also excellent profit to sell back in non-tropical ports (especially Europe).\n\n\nAdditionally, this question and some similar to it can be found in the depths of the /r/AskHistorians FAQs which can be found here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/dailylife#wiki_piracy</p>",

                "answer": "<p>First, a word of warning-my own specialty of weapons of war, and I have not been able to find much in the secondary literature about late medieval knives specifically - as opposed to armour and swords, which have been dealt with extensively. This is thus a more general answer than I would prefer, about medieval ferrous metallurgy in general, and the way it would apply to knife manufacture. You may find my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4b49zp/how_important_was_good_steel/d167v2t/) about \u2018good steel\u2019 in medieval armour and weapons helpful.\n\n\nAs others have noted, the salient difference between a modern knife from a sporting goods store and a 14th century knife is reliability. You basically know what you are getting when it comes to the knife from the sporting goods store - some alloy of steel and chromium, probably (since so many knives in this price range are stainless steel) - indeed many knives advertise their exact alloy composition. You can also expect that it will be essentially homogenous throughout - that the composition of the alloys will be the same throughout. This is because modern steelmaking processes allow nearly exact control of alloy composition, and can ensure uniformity.\n\n\nThe 14th century knife, on the other hand, presents a different picture. Nearly every phase of the manufacture of a medieval knife would be subject to greater uncertainty than modern cutlery. To quote myself from a [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5641mk/so_ive_been_reading_a_few_books_about_ancient/):\n\n\nTo lay out the basic process, to smelt iron from iron ore (which you need to do to get iron/steel, unless you are making an item from a meteorite) you need to heat the ore until the various non-iron bits combine with oxygen (burn off, basically) or melt out. The simplest and earliest way to do this is in a bloomery, where the iron itself never melts but forms a kind of spongey mass of variable composition, a bloom. Alternately, if you make the furnace hot enough you can melt the iron, which produces a high-carbon mass bit of molten ferrous material called cast iron or pig iron. Blast furnaces were invented in 13th century Europe, though the main source of 14th century steel and iron would be bloomeries.\n\n\nGood quality blades would be made of steel. This can be made in a bloomery under the right conditions. Now, the entire weapon or tool does not need to be made of steel. For some items (swords/knifes/spearheads, files) only the edge or perhaps the surface will need to be made of steel. In order to do this there are two means. The first is to weld a small bit of steel to iron, like making the body of an axe out of iron and then forge-welding a steel blade to it. This is used in traditional Japanese swordmaking, and there is ample evidence for it in medieval European tools and weapons. Some Celtic and Roman swords were made in this way, though the smiths didn't consistently put their hardes material on the edges. The other way of making something partially steel is to case-carburize or 'case harden' it - covering the iron item in a carbon source like plant or animal matter or charcoal and heating it in a low-oxygen environment. Eventually, the iron absorbs carbon and the surface becomes steel.\n\n\n\n\n|In order to make a steel object harder you need to heat treat it by plunging heated medium carbon (.3% or better) steel into a liquid. This changes the structure of the material as it cools rapidly - it forms different crystaline structures - most notably Martensite, a very hard crystalline structure of iron and iron carbide. Now you can plunge it into cold water, (a 'full quench') which produces fantastically hard steel (up to 800 on the vickers hardness scale), to the point where it is brittle. This steel then needs to be re-heated or tempered to reduce its hardness by a little bit and increase its toughness by a lot (so that it is around 380-450 on the vickers hardness scale). Or you can either wait to quench the steel, or quench it into a hot liquid, or interrupt the quench - this is a 'slack quench' - and it hardens the steel somewhat, but not as much. Steels hardened this way are only a little harder than high-tin bronze (like 320 on the Vickers hardness scale compared with 250). Slack quenching was used earlier and more often than full quenching - it is considered an 'inferior' process today, but the lack of extra steps and the perception that it was 'safer' for the object made it more popular (fewer steps also meant there were fewer places where something could go wrong).\n\n\nThere is also the special case of phosphoric iron is iron made from ore with phosphorous impurities in it (bog iron has phosphorous in some cases). This makes it harder - around as hard as a low-tin bronze (up to 200 vickers). Small items can be made from phosphoric iron - a number of medieval 'bodkin' arrowheads are made from phosphoric iron. Unlike carbon steel, phosphoric iron doesn't get harder with heat treatment, and so tops out around 200 vickers hardness or so.\n\nNow, every step of this process - making iron/steel in a bloomery, making that bloom into an object, and then heat treating the (nearly finished) object introduced uncertainty. The original bloom may have uneven carbon content, or include unpredictable slag inclusions. This would make the knife unevenly hard, giving it possible points of failure. While making the bloom into a knife, the smith might introduce additional weaknesses during forging (on weld lines, for instance, if the knife was made in multiple pieces). If the knife was case-hardened, it may be difficult to determine the final carbon content, leaving a knife that was either brittle or still too soft. Finally, heat treatment could either produce a knife that was overtempered - basically as soft as it was when heat treatment began - or too hard if tempering was not successful, leaving the knife prone to breaking. In every step, smiths had only their own eyes and imprecise measurments to gauge the complex chemical processes occurring. It could be hard to tell when things went right, and when they went wrong.\n\nThis is not to say that knives were a total crapshoot. People knew that some steels were better than others - there was a trade in steel (in the form of plates or ingots) from Styria in Austria (largely for weapons and armour) and iron from Sweden (in the form of small \u2018osmunds\u2019 of iron), and a corresponding trade in finished goods made with these \u2018high end\u2019 raw materials. Iron from the iron-producing Ariege region of the French Pyrennes finds its way into goods from Narbonne, while Vicdossis within the Ariege region imported high quality knives made in Parma, in northern Italy. If anything, paying for good quality in medieval steel could produce more pronounced results than paying for good quality in modern metal goods - while modern cheap knives may be bad at holding an edge, they aren\u2019t as likely to fail spectacularly. People would pay for quality, and poor goods could be bought at a discount, to quote the 15th century German preacher Johannes Nider said: \"Every person intends to do his craft (hantwerk) faithfully. If a thing is not good, it sells much more cheaply.\" With that said, telling quality was harder then than it is now, the the overall variability was much higher.\n\nSo to conclude, a knife in the 14th century might hold an edge quite well while being quite tough (if it was made with heat treated medium-carbon steel). Or it might be brittle, or soft.The high end would be around what a modern knife is, while the low end would be a tool that we would consider rather flawed, but would most of the time be good enough to do the job (unless is broke).\n\nSources:\nWilliams, Alan - The Sword and the Crucible\n\n\nAnd\n\n\nWilliams, Alan - The Knight and the Blast Furnace\n\n\nS.

                "answer": "<p>I've copy and pasted this comment from a similar previous question, which asked why Reagan is such a controversial figure.\n\nReagan is one of the \"great\" presidents from which you can really define an era around. I'm not saying his policies were good, but I am saying that he was highly consequential. Sean Wilentz, a political historian, argues that Reagan deserves to be listed among Jefferson, Jackson, and the Roosevelts as one of the most influential presidents in history. This is particularly notable because of Wilentz's self-professed liberalism.\n\nTo a large degree, Reagan is so mythologized by both conservatives and liberals because he embodied the transition into a new era of politics for the United States, an era in which liberalism was dying and a more hard-line form of conservatism was rising. If the 1940s-1960s were the heyday of American liberalism, the 1980s-2000s were the heyday of American conservatism. Even Bill Clinton took many of his economic ideas from Reagan. We see this transition from liberalism to conservatism in the mid-1970s.  Republicans like Nixon and Ford were, in comparison to Reagan, moderates. Moderate republicans by the 1970s had for the most part eschewed segregationist beliefs, didn't oppose wholesale the federal programs established under the New Deal and Great Society, and supported detente--or the lessening of tensions--with the Soviet Union. Hard-line conservatives, as part of what is called the New Right, viewed these moderate Republicans as too weak on both domestic and foreign policy issues. This New Right movement arose largely for the same reasons as the New Left in the 1960s. Specifically, it was a counter-cultural revolution against the ideas and government programs that made up Lyndon Johnson's Great Society--civil and voting rights acts, federal aid for the indigent, etc. Throughout the 1980s, Reagan and his supporters cast himself as the embodiment of the New Right. This is probably why you see liberals vilify Reagan so much.\n\nThe mythologized Reagan also comes from his foreign policy outlook. Throughout the 1970s many Americans, particularly conservatives, believed that detente wasn't working. The Soviet Union had made gains throughout the Third World in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Africa and Asia. Couple that with the embarrassments of the Vietnam War, the Iran Hostage Crisis, and a series of oil shocks brought about by OPEC in the 1970s, and Americans quickly arrived at the notion that the U.S. had become weak. Reagan wanted to reverse that notion.\n\nReagan's election to the White House in 1980 appeared to usher in a new, more assertive era of American foreign policy. In his acceptance speech as the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee in 1980, Reagan urged Americans of the need to \u201crecapture our destiny\u201d by rejecting the \u201cweakness, indecision, mediocrity, and incompetence\u201d of President Jimmy Carter. Two months later, during a speech delivered at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention, Reagan put forth a plan in which the United States could stop its moral, political, and military decline and become a respected superpower once again. Stressing that \u201cpromoting the general welfare and providing for the common defense\u201d were \u201cone and the same,\u201d Reagan emphasized the need to drastically increase American military power. The only way to ensure American security toward the international Communist threat would be to \u201cconvince them that they could not win at war.\u201d\n\nDespite Reagan's bellicose rhetoric, this desire to reclaim American global prestige through a militaristic foreign policy didn't really pan out. In 1982, Reagan sent U.S. Marines to Lebanon in the midst of a civil war. The goal was ultimately to keep the peace, although there wasn't any peace to keep. A year after the Marines arrived in Lebanon, a truck bomb went off at the Marine Barracks at Beirut International Airport and killed 241 Americans. In the aftermath of the attack, the press brutally criticized Reagan, arguing that he didn't understand the nature of an increasingly multi-polar international order and that the U.S. no longer had the capabilities to assert itself abroad militarily. The criticism Reagan faced for his policies in Beirut eventually led to a turn away from overt militarism (with the brief exception of Grenada) and toward covert support for rebel groups. This \"Reagan reversal\" soon laid the foundation for what would become the Iran-Contra affair, in which the administration illegally provided arms to Iran in order to free American hostages taken in Lebanon. The money gained from these arms transactions were then used by the administration to funnel money to the Nicaraguan contras, another illegal action. At the same time, by mid-1985 Reagan was actively trying to improve relations between the United States and Soviet Union. Obviously, Reagan\u2019s foreign policy initiatives didn\u2019t exactly square with his overly-patriotic, take-it-to-the-Soviets rhetoric. I think this disparity between Reagan's words and actions is really important to your question as it gets at the heart of how Reagan became so mythologized by conservatives. Many conservatives today look at Reagan\u2019s rhetoric, not his policies. They see him as a president that lifted the United States out of a freefall--both domestically and internationally--that began with Johnson and became exacerbated under Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn fact, it appears now that the historical Reagan of the conservative imagination is largely inaccurate (as is the liberal idea of Reagan, although that's a different question). In general, the most recent historians view Reagan as being a \"pragmatic conservative\" that, despite his rhetoric, was not quite as much of an ideologue as most Americans would today consider him. \n\nSources:\n\nBell, Coral. *The Reagan Paradox: US Foreign Policy in the 1980s.

Reagan believed in small government and tested many ideas. What made him great, from the point of view of economists, was his willingness to reject ideas that didn't work, rather than dogmatically stick with them. \n\nFor example, ideas that were tried and rejected include \"starve the beast\" and the \"Laffer Curve.\" The first was the idea that you can force lawmakers to reduce spending on pet projects by reducing taxes (and therefore shrinking their budgets) and the second was the idea that you could increase tax revenue by cutting tax rates since the stinulation of the economy would outweigh the loss in percentage taken from the economy. If that second idea seems bizarre, imagine a government taxing 0% and a government taxing 100%. In the first, the government takes nothing and in the second, the people produce nothing, so governments get zero in either case. It follows, somewhat simplistically, that there is some tax rate between 0% and 100% that allows maximum tax revenues and if your tax rate is higher than that number, the only way to increase revenue is to decrease taxes. \n\nWell, it turned out that lowering tax rates slowed government revenue growth and that pressured nobody into cancelling pet projects. Reagan abandoned both ideas.\n\nOther ideas, however, were very successful. Reagan pushed for Volcker as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve despite Volcker insisting that he would attack inflation based on Milton Friedman's NAIRU model. At the time it was understood that less inflation meant more unemployment, but Volcker believed this to be a necessary, temporary evil, and Reagan gave him the mandate to fix inflation. He did, it worked, unemployment came temporarily, and the economy stabilized at a healthier rate of inflation. \n\nSo Reagan's mistakes, economically speaking, were short-lived, and his successes had long-term impact. \n\nUnfortunately (and this is my political opinion), many current conservatives talk of Reaganomics as everything that Reagan tried, not just the parts that passed the test. </p>",

So I'll see if I can provide some basic background. For most of the first half of the 20th century, Belgian Congo was supposedly a model colony and making it such was actually one of the stated goals of the colonial administration. When it came time for independence the average Congolese was better paid than the average for the continent. This combined with extensive natural resources led to expectations (both in the colony and without) that independence was going to make the Congo a relatively rich, stable, and successful nation.\n\nBy the time independence arrived, two major parties had formed. The MNC favored a strong central government, a national identity, and the black educated class the \u00e9volul\u00e9s. Although stating that any policy was \"MNC\" is a bit of a misnomer. It was a big tent party, and it had wings that opposed everything I've written above. And in fact by the time I talk about below it had formally split into two major parties. The other major party was the ABAKO which favored a weak central government, regional identities, localized power, and especially the SE province of Katanga. They also had several other smaller regional parties as allies.\n\nIn late 1959 - early 1960 a conference was held to hammer out the question of independence. A six month timeframe was adopted, but most of the other questions were left unresolved. In May the first, highly charged, parliamentary elections were held. And most of the questions about the shape of the government were to be decided by this first parliament. And the initial constitution favored the strong government position of the MNC.\n\nOf course those far from the coast and capital resented this. They also resented the fact that day-to-day existence wasn't much changed by independence. Belgian appointees and technical advisors still held a lot of authority in the new government. The expectation had been widespread that independence would see the whites leave. By early July the largely black army had started mutinying against their white officers. The government recognized the mutineers, promoted all black soldiers one rank immediately. And Congolese Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu was made army chief of staff. These steps largely quelled the mutiny near the capital. But further away it broke into further violence. Initially the violence was directed at white army officers. But it soon extended to all white people. Property was destroyed, whites were killed, and, yes, rape of white women became widespread. On the 9th of July the Belgians intervened and sent in paratroops to protect the Europeans in the country. This divided the Congolese government with some welcoming the Belgians and others calling for outright war with the Belgians. Within a few days Europeans were being officially evacuated, the Belgians were shelling cities with their navy, and a civil war was brewing largely over the questions of local autonomy.\n\nThe war itself was a pretty nasty affair, as you might expect of a war which had widespread rape as early component. It eventually involved both Soviet and US advisors, contained regional and ethnic components, devastated the country, and, yes, still continued to have rape play a major role. That civil war went on for five years until Mobuto took control in a coup. But even after that other mutinies, insurrections, etc remained common recurring events.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I seem to have missed the boat on answering this question, but I would like to clear up some misconceptions I see going on in this forum. It seems like what was going on has already been answered, but I'd like to get into the grit of Catholic doctrine on this. \n\nRedemptionist Friar Brian Johnstone, a theology expert at Rome's Alphonsiana Academy, said that in the early 1960s the Vatican gave permission for religious women in the Belgian Congo to use oral contraceptives due to a high likely-hood of being raped.\n\nOn the surface, this seems contradictory to Catholic doctrine. However, it isn't. Allow me to explain: According to Paul VI's encyclical *Humanae Vitae* a sexual act must consist of two parts within a valid marriage to be considered moral. It must be open to new life (procreative) and it must be unitive (unites the couple/brings them closer together). Note: This does not mean that every time a Catholic couple has sex that they have to be trying to get pregnant. It just means that they have to be having sex in a way that is open to it. This means it is okay to have sex in infertile periods during a woman's cycle (Natural Family Planning) if there is a valid reason for the couple to not have children (e.g. health, finances) because it is still considered natural. You are not doing anything to impede or prevent conception, but rather avoid it for valid reasons. I understand this is very complex. Catholics have an entire theology based around these subjects called *Theology of the Body.* It is very in-depth and is largely based on *Humanae Vitae.* Contracepting would take the whole \"procreative\" part out of the equation because it directly impedes and prevents conception. To the Church, it also takes out the \"unitive\" part of the equation. This is explained here:\n\n> \"The Church has always taught the intrinsic evil of contraception, that is, of every marital act intentionally rendered unfruitful. This teaching is to be held as definitive and irreformable. Contraception is gravely opposed to marital chastity; it is contrary to the good of the transmission of life (the procreative aspect of matrimony), and to the reciprocal self-giving of the spouses (the unitive aspect of matrimony); it harms true love and denies the sovereign role of God in the transmission of human life. A specific and more serious moral evil is present in the use of means which have an abortive effect, impeding the implantation of the embryo which has just been fertilized or even causing its expulsion in an early stage of pregnancy.\" (Pontifical Council for the Family, Vademecum 'Go with me' for Confessors Concerning Some Aspects of the Morality of Conjugal Life, n. 4-5.)\n\n\nHere comes an even more complex part. The nuns that Paul VI granted permission to take oral contraceptives (keep in mind: preventative oral contraceptives, not plan b or anything like that) to would not have met the criteria for a valid sexual act - it isn't unitive or consensual. So, as I explained above, preventative contraception is usually immoral because it takes the \"unitive\" and \"procreative\" criteria out of the equation for sex - not because it is aborting a child. In the case of non-consensual sex, that whole \"unitive\" and \"procreative\" sex thing goes out the window. Stopping the sperm from reaching the egg in the case of rape is totally fine and moral. \n\nSo in the case of rape, the contraception is being used because the nuns never consented to sexual acts in the first place. They are sworn to celibacy. Thus, Pope John VI was acknowledging that the preventative birth control in their case was not immoral because they were not doing it to avoid procreative/unitive sex. They were trying to avoid sex altogether. However, it is important to note that if a nun were to end up pregnant from this, *Humanae Vitae* makes it very clear that abortion is always evil. Pope Francis even repeated this today. \n\n\nIf I haven't explained in an understandable format, please feel free to ask.

I am a bit dubious about that reasoning, mostly because the State of Katanga had surrendered to UN forces (fighting on behalf of the Leopoldville government) in January of 1963, and Paul VI only became pope in June of that year. \n\nMuch more likely, the fighting in the Congo that Paul VI was responding to was the Simba rebellion from 1964-65\n\nThe Simbas were left-wing rebels espousing marxist principles and supported by the Soviet Union, Tanzania, and Cuba. They were dissatisfied with the Western orientation of the Kasavubu/Mobutu government coming out of the civil war, as well as the murder of Patrice Lumumba. Indeed, leaders of the Simba rebellion such as  Pierre Mulele and Christophe Gbenye  had been ministers in Lumumba's government.\n\nThe Simbas garnered attention from around the world by taking many hostages in the city of Stanleyville, including many Belgians, Americans, as well as priests and nuns both Congolese and foreign. International newspapers [devoted much attention](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19641125&id=c1FgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R3ENAAAAIBAJ&pg=5890,2224110&hl=en) to the plight and rescue of [hostages held in Stanelyville](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&dat=19641124&id=NSEmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CP4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5702,3066490&hl=en) in November of 1964. Among the abuses by rebels in Stanleyville was rape against Catholic nuns.\n\nAdditionally, there were other instances where catholic priests and nuns were held hostages and subjected to abuses, including [34 nuns held in Uvira](http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/12/12/page/73/article/11-more-die-in-congolese-atrocities) in December of 1964. \n\nThese instances happened during the papacy of Paul VI and garnered enough newspaper attention that I feel they are most likely events to prompt the action Pope Francis is talking about. Of course, it is possible that Pope Paul VI was informed by the recent history of the DRC from 1960-63 when he made a decision.\n\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>First things first, keep in mind, that Socrates was an Athenian Hoplite who fought in a handful of battles in his earlier life.  I think there is some implication of fitness there, but that depends on the military fitness requirements of Athenian and/or Greek soldiers (if any), and that is a question for someone with more expertise.  Hopefully they'll jump in on this particular point.\n\nThere are pieces in Plato's Symposium that speaks to his time in the military (and briefly mention something that could refer to his fitness).  I won't go into the Symposium's philosophical message except to say it is basically an examination of love.  In it, a handful of men give speeches, and the relevant one in this case is a speech by Alcibiades who is a statesman, a student of Socrates, and a soldier who served alongside Socrates.  In the Symposium, his speech is meant to honor Socrates, and in so doing, we get a tiny glimpse that might be relevant for the question at hand.\n\nFrom Plato's Symposium:\n>His fortitude in enduring cold was also surprising. There was a severe frost, for the winter in that region is really tremendous, and everybody else either remained indoors, or if they went out had on an amazing quantity of clothes, and were well shod, and had their feet swathed in felt and fleeces: in the midst of this, Socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress marched better than the other soldiers who had shoes, and they looked daggers at him because he seemed to despise them.\n>...\n>while he was on the expedition. One morning he was thinking about something which he could not resolve; he would not give it up, but continued thinking from early dawn until noon \u2014 there he stood fixed in thought; and at noon attention was drawn to him, and the rumour ran through the wondering crowd that Socrates had been standing and thinking about something ever since the break of day. At last, in the evening after supper, some Ionians out of curiosity (I should explain that this was not in winter but in summer), brought out their mats and slept in the open air that they might watch him and see whether he would stand all night. There he stood until the following morning; and with the return of light he offered up a prayer to the sun, and went his way \n\nI don't think any of that is a slum dunk that Socrates was fit, but I think it does lend some support to the idea that he took physical fitness seriously at one point in his life.  </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Sokrates never wrote anything down, so all we know about him is how he is described by others. These accounts offer limited information about his life and don't always agree on his philosophies. Apart from the contemporary parody of Sokrates in Aristophanes' *Clouds*, we mostly rely on the philosophical dialogues written by two of Sokrates' students, Xenophon and Plato. Whether these authors represented Sokrates' views accurately or merely used him as a mouthpiece for their own ideas is debated. Whether their image of Sokrates as an ugly, poorly dressed, ostentatiously poor old man matched the reality is up for grabs.\n\nSo, when we get a quote like this, how can we know whether Sokrates really said it, let along whether he lived by it? Unfortunately, we can't really know for sure. What we can do, though, is work out how *likely* it is that he held this view, and if so, how likely it is that he held himself to it. To do this, we need to consider the context of the quote.\n\nThis context is, in fact, a very short Sokratic dialogue by Xenophon (*Memorabilia* 3.12). According to the text, Sokrates ran into a young acquaintance of his named Epigenes, who was out of shape; Sokrates told him he ought to go do some exercise. Epigenes replied \"I'm not an athlete\", at which point Sokrates chewed him out.\n\nThe main point of Sokrates' argument, however, is not that men owe it to themselves to train their bodies so they can look their best. The quote you cited (3.12.8) is little more than the cherry on the cake, a closing line meant to convince Epigenes by appealing to his vanity. The entire rest of the argument is that Epigenes owes it *to the state* to train his body, because otherwise *he will be useless in war.* Epigenes *should* think of himself as an athlete, Sokrates argues (3.12.1), because he will have to fight for his city, and the only way to be a good fighter is to get fit.\n\nSokrates admits, as many modern scholars do, that \"the city does not publicly train for war\" (3.12.5). There was no group drill or military exercise for the Athenian hoplite militia. To make up for this shortcoming, Sokrates says, individual men like Epigenes ought to do all they can to make sure they are at least individually as fit as they can be, so that they won't let their community down or get a reputation for cowardice. All the other benefits of physical fitness listed by Sokrates (3.12.6-8) are just a bonus.\n\nThis argument ties into two strands of Classical Greek thought. The first and older of the two is the ideal that the elite, having the leisure to do whatever they want, ought to use their time to be the best possible people. They should sharpen their minds to become better shepherds to their fellow man, and improve their bodies so they will be better protectors of their community. These ideals have their most competitive product in the Games held throughout the Greek world, with the Olympics being the most famous. In their desire to be the best at paramilitary activities like javelin throwing, wrestling or running in armour, athletes at the Olympics were simply taking an old leisure-class ideal to an extreme.\n\nIn practice, however, most of the rich couldn't be bothered. Having a perfect physique took a lot of hard work that could also be spent hunting or drinking or reading or sleeping with prostitutes. Many among the elite fell short of their ideal of being *kaloikagathoi*, the beautiful and good, who earned their high status by being literally better than others. Both Xenophon and Plato complain about the \"fat rich men\" who live their lives in the shade and aren't worth much when called upon to fight for their city. Instead of exemplars for the common folk, they are the subject of derision - the pasty white, flabby, gormless rich who wouldn't know which end of a spear to stick in the bad guys. This is why Sokrates in this dialogue (3.12.2) stresses that Epigenes ought to train so that people won't think he's a coward.\n\nThe second strand is the notion that Greek armies really ought to do more training. All sources suggest that they generally received none, and Xenophon and Plato in particular are extremely vocal in their disappointment about this. Both advocate more comprehensive state-funded training programmes. Both also advocate similar methods to be used by armies on campaign. In Xenophon's case, this probably derives from his own experience as a mercenary and his observations when he was living with the Spartans. For Plato, however, it simply fits into the general philosophical trend of the later 5th and particularly the 4th century, to regard all areas of expertise as teachable, including martial prowess. In this new way of thinking, armies didn't just fight with innate skill or courage, but could be taught to fight better. They needed to be trained, both in collective drill and mock combat, and in weapon proficiency. Since no Greek state went very far in bringing this into practice even in the later 4th century BC, Xenophon and Plato could do nothing but describe the superior condition and military abilities of those who *did* train (the Spartans, and the Guardians of Plato's ideal city-state, respectively), and encourage individual members of the leisure class to do themselves and the state a favour by setting the right example. This is what Sokrates is made to say (3.12.5):\n\n> I tell you, just because the city does not publicly train for war, you must not make that an excuse for being any less careful in attending to it yourself.\n\nWith this context in mind, is it likely that Sokrates held these views and practiced what he preached? As a contemporary of the sophists, who were the first to argue that anything could be taught, it is possible that Sokrates already believed in the merits of military training. However, the frustrations of Xenophon and Plato, and their hammering on about training as a result, belongs to the 4th century BC. The specific reference to a lack of proper state-funded training, and the complaint about rich citizens who choose to be weak and lazy, shows that Xenophon is using Sokrates here as an authoritative mouthpiece for his solutions to problems he saw in his own time. There is little to suggest that there was a debate on the merits of military training in Sokrates' day, so it's not very likely that Xenophon was representing the actual words of Sokrates.\n\nAs to whether Sokrates himself was in shape, there isn't much to go on. Xenophon insists that he was fond of dancing, which may have kept him spritely even in old age - but dancing is often promoted as another way to stay fit and agile for battle. Perhaps this is yet another intrusion of Xenophon's own obsession with the need to prepare for war. \n\nWe do know from Xenophon and Plato that Sokrates - being a member of the leisure class himself - saw extensive military service. He served at the siege of Potidaia (432-430 BC), at Delion (424 BC) and at Amphipolis (422 BC), earning a reputation for level-headedness, courage, and indifference to hardship. But there is nothing to suggest that he was fit. The army certainly wouldn't have trained him, since, as noted above, Greek armies didn't train. Some armies held athletic competitions while on campaign, to improve the overall fitness of the troops by invoking their competitive instincts, but there's no evidence that the Athenians at Potidaia did this. No part of Sokrates' typical description suggests he was muscled; instead, he is described as lean and ugly and dirty. His hardiness on campaign wasn't meant to show his embodiment of the old leisure-class ideal of the perfect man, but to prove his credentials as a perfect *philosopher*: putting mind above matter, he had become completely indifferent to the sufferings of his body, allowing it to go without warmth or food at will. It seems highly unlikely that such a man, if Sokrates was really like this, could have maintained a perfect physique.\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>OK, so there seems to be precious little information out there on this. A few other users have done an excellent job tracking the citations back, and jumping into the fray myself I was able to find some discussion of the claim in \"US Combat Shotguns\" by Leroy Thompson, who focuses on two sources, Milton F. Perry and Paul Jenkins, who both wrote articles on the use of 'Trench Guns' during World War I, and both who make mention of the claim, which we can say with confidence dates back to the war itself, as an advertisement for DuPont from 1918 makes mention of the practice. He quote extensively from both. Perry, writing in 1956 ([Found the article](http://www.gunsmagazine.com/1956issues/G0256.pdf)), recounts:\n\n>With the utmost secrecy, trap shooters were recruited, trained in a hush-hush program, and rushed overseas. At Chateaux-Thierry [sic] modern shotguns  red with world-wide reverberations, though the public did not know it until afterwards. A German attack was imminent; and it was the drive of 1918. Americans were rushed to bolster the line: marines, infantry and shotgunners.\n\n>In outposts ahead of the main line of resistance we placed some of our very best trapshooters \u2013 men who could hit a flying bird upon instantaneous reaction. In the trenches was a unit composed of those who had shot at sporting meets back home. Breathlessly they awaited the assault.\n\n>Their first warnings were German \u201cpotato masher\u201d hand grenades lobbing through the air. Few landed as most of them were exploded in the air by the experts in the outposts. Upon the failure of the grenade attack, the enemy launched a mortar attack. Again the trapshooters proved their worth, de ecting the slowly arching bombs. Finally, a vast grey [sic] wave of the Kaiser\u2019s best surged forward. \n\nHowever, Thompson doesn't find this to be too credible, or at least the claims about it being so organized, and finds other claims made by Perry, such as a claim about 50 rounds per minute, to also strain credibility. While he doesn't discount the feasibility of using a Shotgun to take out incoming grenades, he *does* question how consistent such a program could be, and furthermore that given the *lack* of records, it seems that at best we can say it was not used often. \n\nAs for Jenkins, writing earlier in 1935 (My efforts to find the article, as others, also failed), he sought out to evaluate the claim, and at least found it to be technically feasible, but has his doubts about the practice:\n\n>We found the [training] bombs could not only be hit, but we shattered one of those cast-iron dummies in the air, with buckshot? Yet let me rise to remark that, while it is alright to stand and shoot at the incomers at skeet stations 1 and 7 \u2013 IF the said incomer were an iron bomb weighing 27 ounces and timed to explode in 5 seconds from its start, and you had 20-inch cylinder-bore shotgun with 9 pellets of shot with which to hit it and knock it away \u2013 what would you do? I cannot escape a strong conviction that all world\u2019s sprint records would be broken in the next instant of time by somebody moving, so to speak, away from there! \n\nThompson apparently attempted to replicate the experiment, and had almost no success deflecting the grenades, but as they were duds, we can't discount the fact they might have exploded even if not deflected.\n\nSo at least as far as Thompson goes, the sum of the argument is that there are several mentions, dating back to the war itself, of shotguns being fired at incoming grenades, so it is quite likely that it *did happen*, if only in a few isolated attempts. The claim about professionals and organization seems to be much less likely. While he may have simply missed a source, the first mention of this aspect that Thompson tracked down comes from the 1950s. If anyone has success getting the entirety of the Perry article, or of other early sources repeating the claim, it might help clarify things, but right now the best we can say is \"partially true\".\n\nEdit: Trawling through old issues of American Rifleman to hopefully find mention, no luck yet. I did, however, find in Vol. 64 No. 14 mention that trap-shooting was used as part of the training program for Airmen, as it helped train them about shooting at moving targets. Of additional interest, while the article notes approvingly that the shotgun is a popular weapon in the trenches, and that there are \"100,00 trapshooters in the National Army\", it *doesn't* make mention of this particular usage. But of course, in March 1918, when the issue came out, Americans had seen minimal combat.\n\nEdit II: SUCCESS! Sept. 29, 1917 Vol. 63, No.  18 of American Rifleman (Then still called Arms and the Man), page 358. Emphasis mine:\n\n>**Club Teaches Public to Shoot\"**\n\n>The Nebraska State Sportsman's Association is thoroughly alive to the needs of the times. It is a most energetic body. Some time back it elected its president to the Governorship of the State, and now its secretary appeals to every club member in a bulletin to take up trapshooting as an aid to the Government.\n\n>The bulletin, which is appended, is of interest to every gun club and State Sportmans' Association, and it would be a good move if many other State associations followed the example of Nebraska:\n\n>>\u201cTrapshooting formerly known as the \u2018Sport Alluring\u2019 has willingly had its name changed to the \u2018Patriotic Sport.\u2019 Why the Patriotic Sport? Because the United States Government has recognized it as a long step toward preparedness and has adopted the shotgun as a most valuable defense weapon. \"Think of the chances of the enemy getting into our trenches for a hand-to-hand conflict with a bunch of American trapshooters stationed there with magazine shotguns, each containing 10 loads of buckshot. **Shotguns are also to be used for the destruction of the handthrown grenades.**\n\n>>\u201cThousands of trapshooters have gone to the colors and when they arrived at the training camps they took to the army rifle like ducks to water. Officials in the army said if all recruits were as prepared as the trap shooters they could step to the front and win the war in a few months. The Government -recognizing this immediately established traps at every training camp. Their first order was for six million clay targets, some of which went to the boys in France. Expert shooters are at all camps and aviation schools teaching the boys to shoot.\n\n>>\"It is the patriotic duty of every club in our association to open their traps to the public with no charge except for actual expenses, and it is the patriotic duty of every member to get the boys who have registered for services to the traps and teach them to shot. It will not only save the Government the time to prepare them after they arrive at the train ing camps, but it may actually save their lives.\n\n>>\"I feel it is my patriotic duty as your secretary to insist upon prompt action by your club, and if you feel the thrill that I felt upon learning the Government had recognized our favorite sport as the Patriotic Sport, you will get busy. Do not let anyone tell you it is not right to shoot as the ammunition you are using may be needed for the army. Just the opposite, it is not conservation, but preparedness. Shotgun ammunition is going to be manufactured as a Government necessity.\"\n\nSo I would stress this dates to late 1917, before any Americans saw combat, so this doesn't speak to the actual employment in battle, but it clearly demonstrates that this was being discussed in theory at least even before the Americans entered the trenches.\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Pre-answer TL DR: No it didn't.\n\nMinor notes: You're probably thinking of what everyone thinks about when they think Roman Army. Legionnaires, armed with Lorica Segmentata, Gladius, Scutum and etc, (The latter two simply mean sword and shield in Latin, but have become associated with the specific arms in the modern age) but I'm going to range a bit more and even move into the Byzantine period, because it may be helpful to talk a bit about the development of the Roman army and its style of warfare in answering this question.\n\nReal Answer Time: While the Roman army was famously adaptable, and used many different sorts of weaponry, I have come across no mentions of any sort of focused attempts to improve the quality of equipment in the sort of way you might see with military R&D in the modern age. While the equipment, techniques and tactics of the Roman military evolved over the years, the changes were more like the natural phenomenon of evolution than focused R&D. They absorbed tactics, utilized new equipment as it was developed or encountered and changed their methods as old ones were found inadequate to new situations, but when there were focused attempts to reform the army, (The Marian Reforms, for example) they were generally the efforts of one or a few men over a short period of time, rather than the sort of consistent, self-sustaining effort we see in modern science. To illustrate this, I'll give a few examples of some of the changes the army underwent in its 1000+ years of operation.\n\nThe earliest accounts of the Roman army have them fighting in the Greek style, with levied hoplites as the main power of the army. While accounts are inconsistent as to precisely when, or against who (Possibly either the Gauls or the Samnites) the Romans made the change to the Manipular system, but the consensus is that it was for tactical reasons. The Greek style phalanx, while excellent from the front on flat ground, was serving them poorly in the hilly terrain of Italy against enemies who had no intention of fighting like Greeks themselves, and were happy to exploit that terrain to break up the Phalanx. (The Romans themselves would use similar methods when fighting the Macedonians years later) The maniple was adopted in response to tactical failings, but it would then go more or less unchanged for a further two centuries, until the Marian reforms.\n\nJumping forward to the famed Legion of Cohorts, while it was an adaptable force, post-Marius there doesn\u2019t seem to have been a conscious effort to push it forward in terms of equipment. If you look, for instance, at the legionaries depicted in Trajan\u2019s column, they don\u2019t seem to differ much from the forces deployed in the campaigns of Julius Ceaser, a century and a half earlier. One thing that would have changed is an ever growing use and importance of non-roman troops both as Auxiliaries and in later periods in the Legions proper. This contributed to a further decentralization in fighting style, as many non-romans would continue to fight in the style of their people, rather than adopting the methods of the legion. This, in fact, made them quite valuable for plugging holes in the roman fighting style. Much of the Roman skirmishing force and cavalry was auxiliary in this period, though they did also serve as heavy infantry. \n\nMany of the changes in equipment and fighting style in the later roman period were not necessarily improvements, and certainly weren\u2019t the result of centralized study. Rather, they were a response to the changing fortunes of the empire, which no longer had the money, political stability and manpower to support the legions of old in the numbers necessary to hold back the enemies of Rome.  We see a shift to scale and lamellar armor in this period, away from plate, not because it was more protective (it probably wasn\u2019t) but because it was cheaper and easier to produce and maintain, making it more attractive to roman coffers drained by financial collapse, inflation/debasement, and raiding. (Some have argued that only frontline soldiers would have heavy armor at all, though this is most likely no more than situationally true.) Also, longer swords like the Spatha tend to replace shorter Gladii, again, not because they were better (Evaluating swords even today is messy business, and the question \u201cIs this a better sword?\u201d is generally best met with the reply \u201cBetter for what?\u201d) but because they were more in the style of the Germanic soldiers that began to fill the Empire\u2019s ranks as plagues and warfare drained traditional supplies of manpower.\n\nShifting even later, the Byzantine Army underwent many changes in its time, again, as a response to the changing fortunes and enemies of the empire. They adopted horse arches, and many of the tactics of the steppe forces that were so successful against Rome\u2019s heavier legions. They avoided the pitched battles that were so common in Roman times, because their smaller, poorer and more heavily beset empire could not afford to wager armies in pitched battles the way the Empire could in the 1st or 2nd Centuries. Always, though, these changes were not as a result of the conscious study or development that we conceive of when we speak of modern military science. Rather, it was an amorphous, naturally occurring progression, composed of individual reforms, gradual changes and adaptation in the face of changing enemies and changing fortunes. \n\nLendon, J. E.

The infamous scene from \"Downfall\" which you reference is fairly faithful to the accounts we have from the bunker as the script is heavily based on testimony and memoirs from the survivors of the Bunker. It should be noted though, that that particular spate of anger, which is abbreviated for the film and lasted roughly half an hour, was described as being even beyond the norm for Hitler's anger sessions, screaming about all those who he had seen as betraying him. Kershaw aptly describes it as a \"storm [that] had been brewing for days\", finally unleashed by news of Steiner's failure to attack as ordered. \n\nIt is also particularly notable since, while those who read between the lines have tried to suss out what Hitler *really* felt about the direction of the war, it was only at this point on the afternoon of April 22nd, with the Soviets moving into Berlin and the city in ruins around him, that he finally openly admitted to those around him that the war was lost, collapsing into tears once his anger could no longer carry him and the \"storm subsided\".\n\nSo to directly answer your question, while the scene from Downfall is portraying a *particularly* extreme outburst of anger from Hitler, especially in the later years as things no longer went his way, such incidents were more and more common, and well documented by those who survived to give their recollections.\n\nKershaw - Hitler: 1936-1945</p>",

                "answer": "<p>You have to understand that while Hitler was certainly a fiery speaker and a dramatic figure in his life in the public realm, that many of his actions were deliberate to create a certain image of him as a man devoted to his country and a strong central leader for the country to follow.  His behavior also changed between the pre-war period and the end days, as a combination of psychological stress and questionable medical treatments by his physician, Theodor Morell, took their toll.  So while \"Downfall\" certainly captures the last days of Hitler and his Reich as authentically as most surviving witnesses can attest, for the most part Hitler behaved in a manner that he thought would be advantageous to achieving his personal goals.  While he was called a Teppichfresser (invoking the image of a small angry dog chewing up the carpets) on several occasions, this was mostly a description by detractors who more often than not did whatever they could to disparage the regime (assuming they were out of the reach of the SA or the SS, at least).  \n\nHermann Balck, for instance, wrote that in his encounters with Hitler that there were only two times someone yelled, and neither time it was Hitler.  His first encounter, for example, had Hitler being jovial with the local military units, and easily able to get along with the common troops (cracking some jokes at the Gauleiter's expense).  Later on, Balck mentioned how when he was describing a military situation Hitler had placed his hand on his shoulder, and described the experience as if he had been under a spell.\n\nLloyd George was thoroughly impressed by Hitler when he had first met him, and was impressed by his hold on the German people, little aware of the legions of stormtroopers and bureaucracy that held the system together, even describing him as the \"Greatest Living German.\"  While his opinion of Hitler deteriorated with Anglo-German relations, it suffices to say that Hitler knew his man and was prepared to act according to however he deemed necessary to achieve his goals, whether it be to play the clown or to be an angry demagogue.  And though popular opinion portrays him as the bellicose madman as seen in theater, one certainly could not create the kind of loyal cult that followed Hitler simply by being the loudest shouter.  </p>",

                "answer": "<p>The stereotype of Hitler as a choleric is an old one.\n\nThe stereotype mainly comes from the way he delivered his speeches. He had a persona on public occations, which was different from his private person (as other posters noted, he privately also got more choleric the longer the war dragged on). The way he speaks, the way he gestures, the whole Hitler changes into an calculated explosive, outraged, angry, screaming agitator. This was/is parodied quite often, for example in [The Great Dictator (1940)](https://youtu.be/Z4UhJpviVYg?t=211). That the way Hitler spoke, with his rolling Rs and general *B\u00fchnendeutsch* plus South German accent sounds quite angry to most people, doesn't help.\n\nThere were also legends of his (real) fits of rage in Germany as early as 1941, recalled by Klemperer in his book LTI: Notizbuch eines Philologen:\n\n> Im Herbst 1941, als von einem raschen Kriegsende keine Rede mehr sein konnte, h\u00f6rte ich viel von Hitlers Wutanf\u00e4llen erz\u00e4hlen. Erst waren es Wut-, bald danach Tobsuchtsanf\u00e4lle, der F\u00fchrer sollte in ein Taschentuch, in ein Kissen gebissen haben, dann hatte er sich auf den Boden geworfen und in den Teppich gebissen. \n\n> In the autumn of 1941, when a quick victory was out of reach, I heard a lot talk about Hitler's fits of rage. At first it were fits of rage, then temper tantrums, the F\u00fchrer is reported to have bitten a handkerchief, a pillow, then thrown himself on the floor and bite in the carpet.\n\nThe reason for this calculated use of outrage and anger is the blueprint of the typical speech of Hitler.\n\nAt first, he defines a deficit, then he identifies and attacks the \"guilty ones\", then he says the listeners how they can help him which molds him and the listeners into a great collective. \n\nThe arc of suspense is made in a way that the attack on the guilty ones is just before the highlight of the speech (the unification of Hitler and the listeners), the stronger the outrage about the deficit, the stronger the attack *ON THEM*, the stronger is the binding *OF US* afterwards, which was the objective of the whole exercise. \n\n\n\nIt's the same when he talks to the [Generals of the Reichswehr](http://www.1000dokumente.de/index.html?c=dokument_de&dokument=0109_hrw&object=translation&st=&l=de) as it is when he [talks about attacking Poland](http://www.1000dokumente.de/index.html?c=dokument_de&dokument=0209_pol&object=translation&st=&l=de), as it is when [he talks after the 20 July 1944.](http://www.1000dokumente.de/index.html?c=dokument_de&dokument=0083_ahr&object=translation&st=&l=de)\n\nTL; DR: As Hitler was calculated outraged and angry in his speeches a lot, it got inferred rather quickly that he privately was a choleric person, so maybe the fits he did have got blown out of proportion as early as 1941.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>That is a remarkably... *specific* question...\n\nThe Greek sources after Homer tell us very little about specific ways to incapacitate people in combat, and most of our modern assumptions are based on reconstructions of how the equipment they used would protect someone and how a warrior might have the best chance of inflicting a wound. \n\nSince Greek heavy infantry went into battle carrying a large round shield in front of him, it has long been assumed that the only effective way to hurt an opponent was to go for the thighs (below the shield) or the throat (above the shield). However, Christopher Matthew has recently done a lot of work comparing combat depictions, actual remains of ancient armour, and \"experimental archaeology\" (testing out replicas), and his conclusion is that the notion of a throat \"kill shot\" is probably a myth. Excavated armour that shows combat damage has usually been struck in an upward direction, suggesting straightforward underarm thrusting rather than overhand \"poking\" over the rim of the enemy's shield. The most common targets for spear thrusts of this kind were the enemy's centre mass - his chest, straight through the shield - and the head that poked out over the shield. \n\nHowever this may be, it is a fact that the meat and two veg were essentially unprotected by even the heaviest Greek hoplite panoply. Only a few strips of hardened linen served to deflect blows to the hoplite's other spear. A warrior could do no more than use his shield and his distance from the enemy to keep his manhood safe. Therefore, whether by overhand or underarm thrusting, blows aimed at a man's junk may well have been common; it was a \"soft target\" in more ways than one.\n\nAmazingly, we actually have an ancient reference to a man struck in the nethers and bleeding to death from the resulting wound. The 7th century BC Spartan poet Tyrtaios wrote these immortal lines:\n\n> An aging warrior cut down in the vanguard of battle\n\n> disgraces the young. His head\n\n> is white, his beard is grey, and now he is spilling\n\n> his powerful spirit in the dust,\n\n> naked, **clutching his bloody groin;** a sight\n\n> for shame and anger. But youthful\n\n> warriors always look good, until the blossom\n\n> withers. Men gape \n\n> at them in life, and women sigh, and dying\n\n> in combat, they are handsome still.\n\nSome scholars have taken the line about the man's wedding tackle to be a reference to mutilation of the war-dead; his privates must have been cut off for him to be able to hold them in his hand as he lies dying. But this is of course unnecessary - most people can reach their family jewels just fine even when they are attached. More likely, then, the man was stabbed in the twig and berries, and the wound was lethal. He serves Tyrtaios as an example of a graceless death; old men do not make great warriors, and the young should strive to do the work for them, knowing that they will have beauty and glory even if they fall.\n\nEdit: also, yes, the Greeks were fully aware of the phallic nature of spear-fighting. One of Ares' epithets was \"the Penetrator\".\n\nEdit 2: this post about getting shanked in the balls is now my ~~second~~ most upvoted post ever. Thanks a lot, Reddit</p>",

It was contested in the Olympic Games for about 1000 years, so there are many accounts about rules, techniques, and foul play. The players [fought naked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankration#/media/File:Foul_pankration_at_Kylix_by_the_Foundry_Painter_BM_VaseE78.jpg) so the groin could certainly be targeted. It was not uncommon for players to be killed in competition, so it was certainly an extremely vicious event. The rules only explicitly disallowed biting and eye-gouging, so groin shots were legal.

The stances of trained grapplers tend to make the groin one of the harder areas to target, after all. But in the end, pankration is not warfare, so all it really tells is is that groin shots were not seen as particularly taboo.\n\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>This is a really interesting question because it actually has *two* answers, which in turn says a lot about the phenomenon of alien abduction narratives.\n\nAlien encounter/abduction/near-miss \"reports\" start to bubble up in the wake of the events at Roswell in 1947. I say \"reports\" in quote marks because it's often difficult to tell whether many of these are *intentionally* fiction (related on radio shows, in pulp magazines; crafted by hypnotist-therapists with a preexisting interest in the paranormal, etc). The first abduction story to truly go viral, of course, was the saga of Barney and Betty Hill from 1961, reconstructed through dreams and hypnosis in the next couple of years and hitting prime time in 1965.\n\nThe Hills' story codified what would become a pattern in abduction narratives, although it has one or two precedents from the 1940s-50s era: the medical examination. Folklorists have seen alien abductions as a \"scientific update\" of supernatural and mundane kidnapping tales. In the 1960s, medicine was a pivotal and socially-oriented prong of science. For example, family medicine was instituted as a formal, board-certifiable specialty at the end of the decade to fill an obvious need: as more and more physicians shifted into more particular specialties with growing scientific advances, more and more families could afford to visit doctors on a regular basis, which had created a large gap.\n\nBoth Betty and Barney reported medical examinations as part of their abductions. Betty described the collection of hair and fingernails, and a long needle being inserted into her belly button. After hypnosis, Barney became the first known abductee to report a probe of some sort being inserted into his rectum. He understood this to have an explicitly sexual purpose, linked immediately to the collection of sperm in a cup.\n\nThere's a lot of drama surrounding whether the Hills were influenced by episodes of *The Outer Limits.* I'll point out that a lot of the things that have been attributed to those episodes (the appearance of the aliens, for example) actually have *long* histories in pulp SF. Perhaps we can tally them up to \"ideas in the air.\"\n\nMore important for current purposes is--*the massive publicity that the Hills' story garnered from 1965 on did not mention the anal probe.* It's hard to say whether the censorship was due to discomfort with sex, rape, or anal sex or rape specifically. The slightly earlier abduction story of Brazilian farmer-turned-lawyer Antonio Vilas Boras, despite his attempts to gain attention prior to the Hills' PR explosion, seems to have faltered based on its crux: he was kidnapped in order to, apparently, reproduce with a sexy female alien. On the other hand, 1965 isn't that far from the introduction to pop consciousness of one Captain James T. Kirk, intergalactic ladies' man.\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, medical testing and, yes, sexual reproduction staked out prominent places in the standard UFO abduction \"script.\" There's not a lot of, er, backdoor action at this point, though. For that we have to wait until 1987. Two media sensations coalesced in this year.\n\nFirst, U.S. president Ronald Reagan struggled with colon polyps and cancer throughout his presidency. In 1985, he underwent a colonoscopy and colectomy during which he transferred power over to the vice president temporarily. A follow-up colonoscopy and polyp removal in 1987 were even more widely publicized.\n\nAll that attention to the president's colon may have inspired, but certainly led people to pick up on a particular detail in a horror-SF-memoir (?) book published shortly after the president's 1987 procedure. Whitley Strieber presents the long story of his encounters with probable extraterrestrials in *Communion* as memoir. He presents the experience of anal probing as very specifically *rape*:\n\n> Two of the stocky ones drew my legs apart...They inserted this thing into my rectum. It seemed to swarm into me as if it had a life of its own. Apparently its purpose was to take samples, possibly of fecal matter, but at the time I had the impression I was being raped, and for the first time I felt anger.\n\nIn addition to the colonoscopy angle catching people's imaginations, one has to think of public attitudes towards homosexuality in the late 1980s, especially with the AIDS epidemic ravaging the gay male population in the US. (Arguably, a significant portion of \"colonoscopy humor\" in 1980s-1990s media turns on homophobia and stereotypes of masculinity being violated).\n\nIn the scheme of influential alien abduction stories, the Hills' medical testing (minus Barney's recounting of the anal probe) and Strieber's rape-for-science have an important thing in common. When we find stories with similar characteristics whose date of *occurrence* predates them, the *announcement* date occurs afterward. Albert Lancashire didn't report his 1942 abduction that featured many of the now-stock tropes, like medical testing and amnesia, until after the Hills' version was famous. And Budd Hopkins' collected stories published in the 1980s (1981, 1987) are filled with lurid tales of reproductive violation, like the poor Indianapolis woman who recounted being forcibly impregnated and then having the fetus cut out of her stomach. (She was later abducted a *third* time in order to see her child.) But while he claimed to have been told other stories involving anal probes from the 70s and 80s, he \"mysteriously\" had made none of these public until conferences and books in the 1990s.\n\nSo overall, we can pinpoint two places in the folk/lore of UFO encounters and alien abductions where anal probing tried to enter the narrative. The first time, it was supressed. The second time, it caught fire.\n\nETA: Further reading:\n\n* Bridget Brown, *They Know Us Better Than We Know Ourselves: The History and Politics of Alien Abduction* (2007)\n* Thomas Bullard, \"UFO Abduction Reports: The Supernatural Returns in Technological Guise,\" *Journal of American Folklore* 102 (1989) </p>",

NICAP was a private non-profit research group founded in the late 1950s to investigate reports of UFOs. At the time, it was taken very seriously. Its members included several prominent journalists, scientists, and retired military personnel. It was most active around 1960-1980. Over the years it gradually lost prestige and membership as UFO-ology in general was relegated to the fringes. But for a couple decades it was a big deal. The group worked with the Air Force and the University of Colorado on the \u201cCondon Committee\u201d, an official investigation launched in 1966. \n\nStarting in the 1960s, NICAP began to send investigators to interview people who claimed to be abducted. One of the first interview subjects was a couple, Betty and Barney Hill. Investigator Walter Webb interviewed them in the fall of 1965. Their fanciful story was published in a report entitled [Dramatic UFO Encounter in the White Mountains, New Hampshire: The Hill Case, Sept. 19-20, 1961](http://www.nicap.org/reports/610919hill_report2.pdf). On page 11, Webb recounts Mr. Hill\u2019s description of a medical examination by the aliens:\n\n>He felt cup-like device placed around his genitals and believed sperm specimen was somehow withdrawn. His left arm was scraped for skin cells, and his ears and throat were checked. He was rolled over on his stomach. A cylindrical object was inserted up the rectum, and once again the witness believed something was extracted.\n\nOver the years, several other NICAP interviewees reported medical examinations of various types, but Mr. Hill\u2019s account was particularly well-known in the UFO community. Yet for many years, these stories were not known in the public mainstream, and the Hill report was only known among those in official UFO circles or those who possessed the curious hobby of researching UFOs, the tiny community that came to be known later as Ufologists. \n\nBut the story of Betty and Barney Hill \u2013 which was also made into a book in 1965 \u2013 was certainly known to Ufologist Budd Hopkins. Years later, Hopkins consulted with horror-fiction writer Whitney Strieber before Streiber wrote [the best-selling book *Communion*]( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294285.Communion).\n*Communion* purports to be Streiber\u2019s version of his own series of abductions. Streiber wrote:\n\n>Soon I was in more intimate surroundings once again. There were clothes strewn about, and two of the stocky ones drew my legs apart. The next thing I knew I was being shown an enormous and extremely ugly object, gray and scaly, with a sort of network of wires on the end. It was at least a foot long, narrow, and triangular in structure. They inserted this thing into my rectum. It seemed to swarm into me as if it had a life of its own. Apparently its purpose was to take samples, possibly of fecal matter, but at the time I had the impression I was being raped, and for the first time I felt anger.\n\nCommunion was made into a movie in 1992 movie, in which Christopher Walken acts out the probing in an unfortunately memorable scene. By 1997, and the airing of the South Park episode, [\u201cCartman Gets an Anal Probe,\u201d](http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe) the subject was firmly embedded in mass culture.  \n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As the 'mechanics' of Medieval battle, so to speak, are pretty comparable to that in Ancient warfare (not to mention that medieval sources don't seem to really talk much about the 'mechanics' of fighting) I think I can help you out here by using examples from the Classical world. /u/WARitter mainly talks about the methods used by Medieval soldiers to identify friendly troops. So I'll give some detail on the actual mechanics of fighting and how that could and often did result in \"friendly fire\".\n\nThere were lots of ways to die in ancient or medieval fighting other than being transfixed or beaten to death by an opponent. For one, it was a phenomenon of the 'rout' stage of a battle that soldiers might deliberately attack men of their own side, in wild panic or in a more deliberate attempt to clear a path. This phenomenon pops up in literary accounts of the conduct of wild, terrified troops. Livy gives a few examples of this phenomenon (and probably quite a few more). Here's an example from a battle between the Romans and Gauls in 350 BC under the consul Marcus Popilius Laenas, from Livy Book 7.24:\n\n>\"...the Gallic host, superior to any feeling for such losses, sprang up like a new army, and urged their fresh troops against the victorious foe\". \n\nAt this stage the battle had been going on a while. The Romans were nearing exhaustion and the consul rashly exposed himself during the fighting, and got a javelin in the shoulder for his trouble, forcing his guards to take him off the field to dress the wound. But once he had done this, he rode back to the front and re-invigorated his troops, who:\n\n>\"drove back the foremost of the Gallic maniples, and then, forming in wedges, burst through into the midst of the main array...barbarians thrown into confusion, having no definite orders nor commanders and, turning, charged upon their fellows.\"\n\nIn this example, the section of the Gauls whose nerve broke first actually charged a body of other Gauls to clear a path for their escape. We might imagine that this might have resulted in a number of 'friendly fire' casualties, especially if the Gauls receiving the charge really tried to stop the runners. This appears to have been a relatively common occurrence in battlefield routs. A more viscereal depiction of this phenomenon can be found in Polybius' description of Zama in Book 15.13, after Hannibal's front line of mercenaries had broken and tried to get away from the Romans through their own second line:\n\n>\"...the [Carthagingian second line] by contrast shrank back in cowardly fashion and failed to support the mercenaries. The result was that at last the [mercenaries] themselves gave way; it seemed to them that they had been abandoned by their own side, and so as they retreated they turned upon the soldiers in their rear and began to cut them down. This action forced the [second line] to die bravely in spite of themselves, for when they found they were being slaughtered by the mecenaries, they were obliged quite against their will to fight both the barbarians and the Romans at the same time: when they had been brought to bay they defended themselves with desperate courage and killed a great number both of the mercenaries and the enemy.\"\n\n'Friendly' casualties could occur during partial routs as officers used violence to compel men to stand and fight. Standard bearers and centurions were particularly liable as targets of exemplary punishment for their decisive role in motivating most soldiers to stand their ground (Livy 2.59). In the Battle of Apulia of 294 BC against the Samnites, after an inital flight the Roman consul Marcus Atilius formed up his cavalry at the entrances to the Roman camp with spears levelled, so that the Roman soldiers had the choice of going back to the fight or physically fighting the consul and cavalry. I can't find the specific sources at the moment, but I am fairly sure I have read of at least one example of an officer killing a standard bearer during battle to set an example. Sidebottom (2004, 109) for instance takes it for granted that officers on occasion killed fleeing soldiers. The role of coercive violence in forcing armies to fight, even the vaguely 'democratic' Mid-Republican Roman armies, make it not hard to imagine that in the heat of battle violence might occur between officers and men whose fear of the enemy has overwhelmed their shame and respect for authority. Indeed, this is why the Romans put the Centurion's second in command, the *optio*, at the back of maniples and cohorts, with a big stick in their hands.\n\nCombatants could die during routs, and no doubt during the press of fighting but especially during routs, due to 'crowd-crush' or being trampled. Livy provides another example of this occurring in Book 10.28, after an impetuous commander by the name of Decius committed his cavalry to an unfavourable engagement against more Gauls:\n\n> \"Twice they compelled the Gallic cavalry to gave way. At the second charge they advanced nearer, and were briskly engaged in the midst of the enemy\u2019s squadrons, when, by a method of fighting, to which they were utter strangers, they were thrown into dismay. A number of the enemy, mounted on chariots and cars, made towards them with such a prodigious clatter from the trampling of the cattle and rolling of wheels, as affrighted the horses of the Romans, unaccustomed to such tumultuous operations. By this means the victorious cavalry were dispersed, through a panic, and men and horses, in their headlong flight, were tumbled promiscuously on the ground. The same cause produced disorder even in the battalions of the legions: through the impetuosity of the horses, and of the carriages which they dragged through the ranks, many of the soldiers in the van were trodden or bruised to death.\"\n\nThis had also happened in the battle I mentioned before in 350 BC against the Gauls: while the Gauls stiffened up later, they had started the battle by trying to attack the Romans uphill, which went poorly: \n\n>\"[The Gauls who had] fallen upon one another wrought greater carnage then even their enemies had done; for so headlong was the rout, that more were trodden under foot than slain with the sword.\" (Livy 7.23).\n\nI cannot personally think of many instances where 'friendly fire' is specifically mentioned to have occurred in ancient battles during the actual fighting, though I'm sure mistakes did occur, especially with missile weapons which could be used heavily in all stages of Roman-era warfare (Plut. *Sulla* 18-9)  For more information on this continuous missile-warfare even during close-combat, see Zhmodikov, \"Roman Republican Heavy Infantrymen in Battle (IV-II Centuries B.C.),\" 2000. There may be examples of friendly fire from missiles in the literature, I just can't think of any.\n\nAs Ancient and Medieval warfare were waged with basically the same technology and the 'mechanics' of infantry and cavalry battle in these eras are basically the same, even if they might be different in context, scale, appearance, etc, I think all of these examples I have provided must have occurred in Medieval battle as they certainly did in Ancient battle. Soldiers whose fear of the enemy has overwhelmed them may attack their own side accidentally or deliberately. Tactical developments may cause one or even large numbers of men to be knocked off their feet and be crushed in the fighting. Officers may deliberately and conspicuously kill their own soldiers to set an example to the rest. And without doubt, when javelins were thrown and arrows fired over the heads of engaged troops, which may have been a common occurrence, there is no question that occasionally a friendly would be struck by a missile. I hope this helps answer your question.\n\nEDIT: Just as regards your specific concern for accidental \"friendly fire\" from sharp weapons, I'll note that it was a particular concern for the Romans to maintain an open formation so that soldiers could use their sword and shield properly, and it would be helpful for throwing *pilum* too. For example, Caesar at the Battle of the Sabis in 57 BC had to order some of his troops to \"...open ranks, so they could use their swords more easily.\" (Caes. *Bell. Gall.* 2.25). We might assume that, as they required space to use their sword and shield properly, being in ranks that were too condensed would logically increase the risk of \"friendly fire\" from swords. Unfortunately, I still can't think of any specific examples of soldiers inadvertently being hurt by the sharp weapons of a comrade during fighting. Still, that idea could easily be applied to Medieval soldiers fighting with swords too.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Hey There!! So there is one incredibly famous incident of friendly fire from the late medieval period, the Battle of Barnet in the Wars of the Roses. Let me take you through that battle and then leave some general discussion points and you all are welcome to follow up if you like.\n\nThe Battle of Barnet was fought in the middle of Edward IV's reign, after his unpopularity and nepotism had driven the Earl of Warwick (one of the most powerful noblemen in the country) to change sides and restart the conflict between Edward IV's Yorkists and Henry VI's Lancastrians. Edward IV had been driven out of the country and was returning to reclaim his throne. Warwick on the other hand, had struck a deal with the Lancastrian queen Margaret of Anjou, the real head of the Lancastrian faction to reclaim her family's position and her son's succession.\n\nAs for the battle itself, there are several things we know with certainty. First off, most chronicles agree that the Yorkists were fairly outnumbered and that Edward IV was aware of this fact. For this reason, he intended to close the distance between the armies and try to surprise his enemies. The results was an early morning battle with lots of fog on the battle field.\n\nAt this point, it is worth saying that I feel confident the Yorkists had a far more cohesive leadership structure than the Lancastrians. Edward IV was a the model of a \"warrior-king,\" incredibly charismatic, with a deft understanding of how to press local advantages in formation and tactically array his army. His right flank was command by his ever-loyal brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and the left flank by his close friend, Lord Hastings. The Lancastrians, despite their numerical advantage, had greater issues in terms of cohesive command. Henry VI was no one's idea of a competent king, or really a competent anything. He was indecisive and dithering, at least when he wasn't suffering from mental breakdowns. Far from leading as a battlefield commander, he was also a prisoner of the Yorkists at the onset of the battle. The Lancastrians were a hodge-podge arrangement of old enemies. The Earl of Warwick and his brother, controlled huge resources and armies, but were latecomers to the cause, viewed by suspicion from by diehard Lancastrians like the Earl of Oxford. Warwick had spent a good part of his life fighting the Lancastrians, feuding in particular with Henry VI's favorite cousins, the Beauforts. These suspicions were not meaningless aristocratic feuding, in this period it was extremely common for factions to change sides, even mid-battle. This would prove to be a huge issue as the battle played out, as it could affect the morale of soldiers on the front lines.\n\nThe Lancastrians started out with a fairly decisive advantage and the early phase of the battle played in their favor too. After exchanging projectile fire, the armies waded through the fog to engage in the melee with polearms. The Earl of Oxford (commanding the Lancastrian right) routed his opposite number, the Lord Hastings, driving him off the field completely and back to the village of Barnet. Oxford then struggled to reorganize his men and stop them from simply looting the town to return to the battle.\n\nHowever, given the wide disposition of the armies, low visibility, and lack of command cohesion, Oxford's rout of Hastings had not really impacted the battle overall. Lord Montagu (Warwick's brother) and Edward IV fought to a standstill in the center. But on the Lancastrian left (Yorkist right), Gloucester began to overwhelm the Duke of Exeter, whose forces began to panic, but their collapse was somewhat slow. The effect of this was that the orientation of the battle turned drastically from how it had started.\n\nAt this point, the Earl of Oxford returned with some of his men, attempting to find his way through the fog to hit the Yorkist rear and flanks. However, he did not know and could not see the re-orientation of the armies, meaning he ended up approaching flank of Montagu's center. The Lancastrians then mistook Oxford's \"star with rays\" banner for the Yorkist \"sun in splendor\" banner and, assuming that Edward IV had committed his reserves, proceeded to order arrow volleys on Oxford's men. Both sides then panicked, Oxford's men assuming treachery by Montagu and Warwick, and Montagu's men assuming a flank attack by the Yorkists. This chaos broke down the discipline of the Lancastrians, and Edward IV, sensing victory, then actually committed his reserve. The result was a decisive Yorkist victory, the deaths of Warwick and Montagu, the capture of Exeter, and the escape of Oxford (who would later join one Henry Tudor).\n\nI hope this example was somewhat helpful in illustrating how friendly fire could happen in a medieval battle. I think there are a couple of key things to keep in mind when looking at \"friendly fire\" works in this period. First of all, most armies worked on concepts of formation and morale. You weren't necessarily looking to stab every person in the opposing army to death, but to break their discipline, cause them to flee (possibly killing each other as they do) and redeploy cavalry to run them down as well as harry survivors to prevent them from regrouping. This cavalry charge was devastating during the rout, and as such pitched battles were considered incredibly risky by most commanders. This is partly why formations are considered so important, ensuring that for the most part, the individual soldier is focused on fighting the man straight ahead of him, knowing that he has friends to his left, right, and back. This is also why in the pre-gunpowder era, there is such an emphasis on flanking and hammer-and-anvil type of tactics, because when soldiers start to fear attacks from an unexpected direction, they panic, running over each other to try to escape death in the rout.\n\nI thought about putting another point on projectile warfare, but this is already running a bit long and so I think I'll just summarize my points here. There were most likely (almost certainly) incidents of individual soldiers accidently or intentionally killing men \"on their own side.\" This would happen especially during the rout, when discipline broke down and survival instinct superseded tactical thought. It is harder to say to what degree \"friendly fire\" occurred during the melee phase, as most medieval chroniclers and sources don't really cover the mechanics of battles. Some experimental historians have attempted to reconstruct these situations and most theories tend to lean on the fact that formations were developed to prevent exactly this sort of thing from happening on an individual level in order to maintain the discipline and morale of the soldiers. However, we do have chronicled evidence from battles like Barnet, where betrayals and mistakes occurred on this type of formation level. Hope this helps and I will do my best to help if you have follow up questions.\n\nSources:\n\n*The Military Campaigns of the Wars of the Roses* by Philip Haigh, 1995\n\n*Warwick the Kingmaker* by AJ Pollard, 2007\n\n*The Wars of the Roses* by AJ Pollard, 1988\n\n*Arms, Armies and Fortifications in the Hundred Years' War* edited by Anne Curry and Michael Hughes, 1994\n\n*Medieval Warfare: A History* by Maurice Keen, 1999</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Hi there and thanks for the question about firearms in battle. While I cannot speak to **all** of world history, there is one particular battle in the Middle East between the old guard Turkish fighting (sword, spear, bow) and the new gunpowder armies that would eventually become commonplace: The Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 between the Safavid Persians and the Ottoman Turks.\n\nI should state at the outset that the \"Persians\" in question were actually Turks (or mostly Turks) who adopted the guise and trappings of the Persians, but retained the emphasis upon traditional \"manly\" warfare; becoming accomplished horse riders, bowmen (especially firing bows from moving horseback), lance/spear, and, of course, swordsmanship. THis took a lot of training, was expensive, and had a track record of being extremely effective in battle. This allowed the Shah (king) of the Safavids (Shah Ismail) to amass a lot of power despite his rags-to-power past; it was so successful that the Safavids added northern Iraq and portions of modern day Turkey (Anatolia) to their territory, where they eventually came against the Ottoman Turks.\n\nFor their part, the Ottomans they had embraced gunpowder weaponry because the training time for such weapons were much shorter than full cavalry \"knights\" like the Safavids had. That's not to say the Ottomans were deploying untrained fighters with guns into battle; far from it. The elite corps of the Ottoman ranks was the much-respected Janissary corp which trained endlessly for war. However, it was much cheaper and much easier to train and equip Janissaries with gunpowder weapons (as well as train them to use artillery) than it was to go a traditional route of training. The rest of the army, though, was merely gunmen and **not** the elite Janissary, receiving only firearms training.\n\nWhen the Ottomans invaded Safavid territory, the major battle - near a place now called *Chalah Ashaqi* - pit the Ottomans against the Safavids in just the kind of battle you are imagining; traditional vs. gunpowder weaponry. The Ottomans' focus upon gunpowder weaponry allowed them to field a larger army (Around 60,000 men) despite not having nearly as much wealth as the Safavids (who brought around 20,000 troops). The result was devastating for the Safavids; they lost 1/3 of their army due to Ottoman use of gunpowder muskets, artillery, and barricades (overturned wagons) to prevent close-quarter combat. The Ottomans would go on to conquer huge swaths of territory by employing pretty much the same tactics over and over again, until they got to Northwest Persia (modern day Iran). Incidentally, Shah Ismail retreated from governing the Safavids, turning to alcohol in the throes of deep depression, leaving his empire to be governed by visirs and advisers (who immediately began phasing in gunpowder weapons and training of their own).\n\nFor more on the Middle East and the rise of the Ottoman \"gunpowder\" empire, I'd recommend:\n\n*Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire* By Caroline Finkel\n\n*Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire* by Jason Goodwin\n\n(EDIT) for clarity and spelling.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>To take /u/VetMichael's great answer to the high seas, we have the Japanese-Korean of 1592. The Japanese navy utilized the old staple of naval warfare : hand to hand combat. Their ships were more floating platforms to fight from than proper military vessels as we would modernly understand it. Almost every single ship in the first few years of the war on the Japanese side lacked any sort of cannon, and was fast but only in the direction dictated by the wind. All the better to fight man to man with swords and arrows, like proper warriors.\n\nThe Koreans, despite bungling leadership at the highest levels and an ineffectual land military, had honed their teeth for years against Japanese pirates and unlike the Japanese navy were loaded down with cannon. Manoeuvrable enough to bring a broadside to bear quickly, fast enough to escape Japanese attempts to grapple their vessels and force a melee, long enough range they could sink Japanese ships far beyond the reach of arrows or the few muskets the Japanese sailors had. Some of the most lopsided naval victories in history are from this war, with a few dozen ships fighting against literally hundreds and emerging victorious. \n\nFor a sense of how surprising the new reality of cannon-based naval warfare was, you need only look at the repeated failures of Korean commanders to realize the importance of destroying the enemy at range. Many times what should have been a lopsided Korean victory was thrown away by charging into Japanese vessels and negating the Korean technological edge. Only a handful, like Yi Sun-sin, recognized their ships couldn't be defeated if they were cautious and kept at a distance. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>The Battle of Nagashino in 1575 was considered to be something of a turning point in Japanese warfare.  The Japanese had already possessed the arquebus for some time, but in the 16th century organized ranks and tactics for arquebusiers was something everybody was still figuring out to some extent.  Nagashino is essentially where they got figured out.\n\nThe 1570's were perhaps the height of the Sengoku, or Warring States period, and the beginning of the unification, with several large houses contending for the Shogunate.  One of the biggest houses was the Takeda Clan, which ruled The province of Kai.  Their most famous Daimyo Lord, Takeda Shingen, was known to be one of the very best field commanders in existence.  He and the Daimyo of Echigo Province, Uesugi Kenshin, were quite nearly legendary at times.  (This was especially true when they fought each other.)  \n\nThe biggest innovation attributed to Shingen was the famed Takeda Cavalry.  Cavalry, of course, is an expensive sort of army to field, and at the time the Takeda were one of the few clans financially able to utilize full cavalry units.  At the time the Takeda Cavalry was seen as one of the best armies in Japan, if not the best army in Japan.\n\nUnfortunately, the Takeda Cavalry and even the Takeda Clan didn't survive Shingen long.  After his death, his campaigns were taken up by his son, Takeda Katsuyori, around the same time that the Oda Clan began what would eventually be the full unification of the nation.  \n\nOne of Oda's most important retainers was a man by the name of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the man who would go on to finish the unification and establish the Tokugawa Shogunate.  (The shogunate would last until the Meiji restoration.)  At one point during Katsuyori's campaigns, one of Tokugawa's castles posed a threat to Takeda supply lines.  Katsuyori decided to take the castle, and while it was under siege the commander, one Okudaira Nobumasa, sent to Tokugawa for aid, and he in turn sent to the Oda.  Eventually, Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Daimyo of the Oda Clan himself, Oda Nobunaga, arrived at Nagashino Castle to confront Katsuyori and his famous Cavalry.  Aside from the battle of Okehazama (the battle the put Nobunaga on the map, so to speak), this was perhaps the most significant battle of Nobunaga's career.\n\nTo start, Oda ordered large palisades be built on the steep slopes of the Rengogawa, the largest stream in the vicinity of the castle.  The palisades were built to allow arquebus fire and pikes to pass through, but did not allow horse to pass.  They were set up in a staggered pattern, leaving some intentional gaps meant to channel and bottleneck any forces that made it far enough.  He then ordered that infantry be equipped with especially long pikes, to help turn back any cavalry that made it as far as the palisades.  \n\nThe arquebusiers were arranged in what would eventually become a standard battle line for musketeers, three ranks that rotated to achieve continuous volley fire.  The sturdy defense of the front line, bolstered by the presence of Nobunaga's own elite bodyguard, prevented infantry ranks breaking during the cavalry charges, and the continuous arquebus fire caused devastating losses.  By mid afternoon, the battle became a rout in favor of the Oda.  In one fell swoop, the Oda Clan introduced both arquebusier tactics and anti-cavalry tactics, effectively eliminating one of the biggest contenders for the shogunate.  After the battle, what remained of the Takeda fell into steep decline.\n\nI would like to point out that after Nagashino, Takeda's longtime rival Uesugi Kenshin turned against the Oda Clan, whom he was formerly allied with.  Even as enemies Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen had always had a profound respect for each other, and Kenshin was known for holding personal honor in high priority.  Oda, on the other hand, was seen by many as being dishonorable in his tactics, and his success was often attributed to this.  Because of this, Uesugi Kenshin confronted Oda and his top generals at the Battle of Tedorigawa, where things were equally one sided.  However, this time the battle went against the Oda Clan, with Kenshin routing the Oda decidedly very early on in the fight.  The loss was significant enough that the Oda Clan made no challenges against Echigo Province or any Uesugi holdings again until Kenshin's death from cirrhosis in 1578.  When he learned of Kenshin's death, Oda Nobunaga was said to have remarked, \"Now the empire is mine.\"\n\nI fuckin' love the Dragon of Echigo.</p>",

It's a description from the Florentine Codex, chapter 7, which relates a description of Spanish gunpowder-weapons, given to the Aztec ruler Motecuzoma by his emissaries.\n\n> He was even more amazed to hear how, on their orders, lightning would fall, that could be heard as a stroke of thunder, when the shot falls it makes people as if stunned, it deafens their hearing. And when the shot falls, and the ball shoots from the inside of the cannon to the outside, it emits a finely divided rain of fire, like spittle flying from the mouth, so it emerges. And the smoke that emerges stinks strongly of sulphur and scorches people's hair. And where the ball hits the mountain, it is as if it bursts open, it crumbles, and where the ball hits a tree, it splinters and breaks inexplicably as if someone blew it over. \n[...]\n> And when Motecuzoma had heard this, he was full of fear, it was as if he was paralysed, he was greatly worried, he was concerned.\n\nAnd from the 22nd chapter, when battle is joined:\n\n> And they, the Spaniards, go and shoot their metal arrows and their firearms, many people are shot through or get hit by balls. The crossbowman aims very well with the arrow, he aims the arrow very accurately at whom he will shoot. And the metal arrow makes a whirring noise as it descends, as if it is whizzing, strongly wheezing. But nowhere do the arrows miss their targets, all shoot someone through, all come to hit someone in their insides. And the firearms, the arquebuses and the cannon, they come straight at the people, they are aimed precisely at the people. But when the shots fall, all go flat to the ground, flat to the ground they seek cover, as if on sleeping pallets all are put down flat, unexpectedly the shot goes over the people, entirely unsuspected they kill people, everywhere they strike people die, where they hit someone in their passage, possibly in his forehead, or in his neck, or in his heart, or in his chest, or in his insides, or in his belly. But if they are merely hit in their thigh or in their shoulder, then they do not die from that, then they do not fall in mortal danger, but they heal again. But when the Mexicans saw how the shots fell, they went from the one side to the other going forwards, paying close attention, and very carefully.\n\nTranslation from the Nahuatl by Rudolf van Zantwijk, from his 1992 work \"Oorlog tegen de goden,\" re-translated by me from Dutch into English.

Fortunately for the european immigrants, the locals liked their steel for tools, guns too, but mostly metal tools.\n\nImagine what 50 kilograms of steel sewing needles looks like to a society without the ability to make steel. People like to talk about guns, but frankly, in the terrain, at the end of supply lines, a flintlock musket is not my weapon of choice. For rate of fire, for lack of ammunition, for cultural expertise in the terrain, local weapons were best. So it really was tools that made the trade.\n\nWomen liked the steel needles, pots, pans, cooking knives etc... and they were very much near the centre of the fur trade at this stage. If you wanted to trade with a village, your best bet was getting the women onside, get them onboard, they convince the men, and the Chief lets one of your compatriots marry an important woman to seal the trade agreement.\n\nFor a long time, this was mutually beneficial, mutually agreed to, and with little systematic violence. Certainly, it was tough, and violence is always present in frontier male dominated societies, but it wasn't typical of any given trade arrangement between European immigrants and the First Nations they were trading with.\nThere was war, but it had less to do with fur trade and more to do with overarching political dramas that Europeans stumbled into locally and ones they brought with themselves from Europe.\n\n\nUltimately it was a very personal industry, you and half a dozen other guys trap and trade in an area, a town will have a trading relationship with First Nations people who come by to trade. It was very much a cottage industry, you traded with people you knew and had relationships with.\n\nAs things developed, small stock companies(think 12 owner shares, 20 employees, and still more of a trading alliance than a real company) developed in the St Laurence/Great Lakes region, the English wanted a piece of the action and made the move for Ruperts Land (all the land that drains into Hudson's Bay) in the late 1670s. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) were chartered, and away they went.\n\nThis was a marked change from the way it went before. From local trappers and traders with personal relationships, suddenly a very well capitalized corporation comes in, sets up shop in fresh territory, and told First Nations they could show up at Hudsons Bay to get some amazing trade deals!\n\nEven until after the 7 Years War when Quebec went to the British, HBC basically waited for the furs to come to them, mostly sticking to the coast.\nThe St Laurence traders, hardy, strong, and having developed a culture of being out in the woods and living like the locals, saw an opportunity, a bunch of different companies formed, that eventually distilled into the Scottish/Quebequois venture known as the North-West Trading Company (NWTC), there were others, but when push came to shove, this was the one that eventually brought HBC to its knees (later in the 1800s)\n\nThey realized that if they could get to the furs before they could get to Hudsons Bay, they could reap profits off the lazy backs of HBC. Naturally, HBC didn't like this and started going inland as well.\n\nNow instead of personal relationships, you have business arrangements, and your competition isn't the guy who lives on the other side of your town you you know and are friends with, instead it was a rival company run by the bloody English/Scottish/French.\n\nNow, this is all happening literally at the end of the world, place that weren't put on maps until the mid 1800s (by David Thompson, one of my favourite peoples in all of history, the guy is personally responsible for mapping over 1/3 of N. America). This was terra incognita, there was no government presence apart from any officialdom the companies had.\n\nThese were massively profitable companies who's influence spread the continent, but if you ever stumbled upon a group of more than a couple dozen Europeans at a time (a couple York Boats, or a flotilla of canoes), it would have been really odd. There were few permanent European (as distinct from Metis cause they are different, /r/muskwatch [has a comment talking about them](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5qcqno/the_new_netflix_series_frontier_portrays_the_18th/dczavh3/)) habitation away from the St Laurence and Hudson Bay coastal forts. In country, you've got maybe half a dozen guys wintering over at a fort, joined by two dozen who are the voyageur team bringing in trade goods, taking out furs in the summer.\n\nThere were flare ups, there were occasional spats, but it really wasn't until the 1800's that there was a real big shift towards more systematic violence, and as much as I can't really defend it, I'm gonna blame it on the Americans.\n\nAmericans didn't really show up until late in the game, Lewis and Clark were 1804-06, and are seen as the ones who opened the West to the US, they were late comers, who had maps, usually made by French or British fur traders, if they are in the show I have no idea why, except because it's made for American viewers, so gotta have some. \n\nAnd if you need any evidence that yes, Americans were a known entity: there are very good reasons why Quebec declined the invitation to join the 13 colonies in Revolution\n\nWhile I wish everyone would go read some original source material, HBC kept records of ledgers, orders, and all the other sorts of things you'd expect from a large stock company, however I prefer the stuff written by the likes of Alexander Mackenzie, Simon Frasier, David Thompson, Simon McTavish, William McGillivray, probably because I've always liked the NWTC better. If you prefer easier reading, maybe something like \"The Map Maker\" by Kerry Wood\n\nAs for a more analytical approach \"The Fur Trade in Canada\" by Harold Innis is my go to book for people who are curious\n\n\n\nI realize I've glossed over tons of stuff, and been lazy on linking things that might require explanation, but I assume you can use google, or ask if you want elaboration on something</p>",

                "answer": "<p>**Occasionally, but typically under only specific circumstances.**\n\nIn the first centuries after the development of the cannon, stone shot was used in most cases. Stone is frangible; it tends to shatter upon impact, and even if a stone cannonball did not shatter, it was easily converted to peaceful use as building material. Both of these factors tended to work against the recovery and re-use of stone cannonballs. During [excavations at Edinburgh Castle between 1988 and 1991](http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3121/) archaeologists discovered a handful of never-fired stone cannonballs and fragments from rounds that had clearly been used and shattered. \n\nThe use of iron shot began to take off in the 16th century and by the 17th century, they were almost ubiquitous. The issue here, as with stone, is that poor-quality iron (endemic in this period) is brittle and will shatter upon impact just as stone will. Given that cannon shot were designed to be destroyed, they were typically constructed of the cheapest iron possible, which increased the likelihood that they would fracture or deform.\n\nNow, allow me to divert you into the question of **why** and **when** solid shot would be recovered. Solid cannon shot, whether iron or stone, tends to be *extraordinarily* heavy for its size and is difficult to handle because of its shape. You have to have a *reason* to go through the effort of recovering a particular solid shot. It is much easier to get new shot from your logistical train than to go through the effort of recovering shot. Large-scale shot recovery only makes sense if your own supplies are limited.\n\nYou might need a block and tackle setup to lift the shot. You'll need wagons and horses to carry the shot away. All this is expensive in both time and labor, which means you typically see shot recovery take place only where large concentrations of artillery have fought in a confined area. The effort of mustering a shot-recovery detail is offset by the ability to collect large amounts of shot.\n\nRemember, too, that you have to cope with matching the shot's caliber \u2500 something not always easy if both sides in a battle aren't using compatible ammunition.\n\nSo to recap: In order for shot-recovery to be feasible, you need to have a shortage of ammunition that forces you to recover shot. You need to have the manpower to be able to recover the shot. You need to be fighting between approximately 1500 and 1870. You need to be at a place where large amounts of artillery were used in a confined area.\n\nThis checklist limits how often cannon shot was reused, but it did happen time and again. Stephen Bull, in his book *The Furie of the Ordnance* about artillery in the English civil wars, writes, \"It is likely that the largest number (of 17th century cannon shot) were picked up and reused, or scrapped, within a relatively short period of the time they were fired or lost. Shot are recorded as having been removed from many of the major battlefields, notably Marston Moor and Naesby, over a very long period of time.\"\n\nMark Thomson's book, *Wellington's Engineers* about military engineering during the Peninsular War, references an account from Alexander Dickson: \"the soldiers were offered a bounty for every roundshot they could recover for re-use and so as not to discourage them, even roundshot of calibres which were of no use were paid for.\"\n\nDuring the Crimean War, when vast amounts of artillery were leveled against the Russian defenders along the Black Sea, the practice of round shot recovery [was captured on camera](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Valley_of_the_Shadow_of_Death.jpg), with the cannonballs in the ditch having been rolled down a hill by soldiers seeking to collect them.\n\nFinally, during the American Civil War, the logistically-strapped Confederacy's quartermaster department [mined the Seven Days battlefields for almost a year afterward](http://www.alu.army.mil/alog/issues/SepOct01/MS604.htm), recovering supplies and spent cannon shot to be used in the war effort. At isolated places like Ship Island, in Texas, and elsewhere, Confederate artillerymen recovered Union-fired round shot in order to keep their guns fed. \n\nThe development of exploding shot and artillery shells brought an end to the era of recovering round shot. Even by the time of the American Civil War, round shot was on the way out of circulation.\n\n\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I am amazed I have something to contribute for this very specific question, but it was only for one specific circumstance.  And I apologize because in order to get the exact quote I will need to interlibrary loan a diary /memoir that is held at Rice University that I took notes from some 20 years ago.  And since these were handwritten notes -- long before I was digitizing things -- I don't know the woman's name from memory.  Hopefully in describing this particular memoir -- because it's story was so unique -- perhaps one of my fellow colonialists will recognize the woman's name in question and I can find the original source again.\n\nAt Rice when I was doing research on southern beliefs I came across a rather remarkable journal / memoir of a woman who had been a refugee after the Revolutionary War.  She and her husband were Tories, he was a doctor, and they would eventually after the war flee to Jamaica.  (Again I hope this will trigger some memories in any of my colleagues to help me dredge up a name -- this woman's story was so fascinating that years later it stays with me.)\n\nAnyway, in discussing the events that led to their abandoning the British North American colonies, she described how she and her husband were present during a siege of a southern city.  And again, I apologize, I do not recall which city, though it may have been Yorktown.  \n\nWhat was remarkable in her narrative was something she mentioned in passing that -- and it struck me to this day -- an event I hadn't even thought about happening.  She described how the streets were part sand in places and how they had been bombarded by the Patriots.  And she described how young black children would run into the streets -- while bombardment was still happening --  to cover cannonballs that had landed but not broken into pieces with sand.  She then described the children digging these up later and selling them back to soldiers on her side -- Tories.\n\nAs I had never run across a story even similar to this, even though it had nothing to do with the research I was doing, it struck me as so singular -- I hadn't even thought about the idea that someone would try to recovered shot solid cannonballs, much less the idea of children \"selling\" them -- it stuck in my memory.  (I also wondered if how she reported the events were quite accurate, as her perception of what the children were doing -- or the fact that they were enterprising versus if they were somehow being coerced into doing so -- but obviously when you only have a single source you have no way to know that.)\n\nI always meant to go back and re-read this diary, so I have to thank you for your question for triggering this distant memory.  And reading The Alaskan's excellent post, above (I am no expert with military pieces, I just happened to have read a firsthand account of the practice by a civilian bystander in my research along the way) it appears the account from the journal I had read matches the circumstances under which he noted that recovery might have occurred.\n\nI did a causal search of the Fondren Library holdings electronic  catalog just now without success to try and see if I could identify the source.  I will call them this week and see if they can help me trace it down.  If any of my colleagues knows the source I am talking about please chime in, it was a pretty unique set of circumstances, so I would have a hard time believing we may not be able to identify the specific name and hopefully in a week or two I might get the source back in my possession so I can pull the original quote.  (I will warn that some of the language in the original quote in reference to the children may contain language that would not be as appropriate to today's sensibilities, so if I get the source and reprint the quote I note in advance some language may be, well, colorful.)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>One particularly interesting example of cannonballs being repurposed was during the on-again, off-again Siege of Candia. The Ottomans wanted the city, the Venetians had the naval power necessary to keep the port open and thus prevent a proper siege, and the native Cretans were hostile to both sides (the Venetians tended to ruthlessly exploit them and the Ottomans were foreign invaders who wanted their island; neither was really a good option for the Cretans). The Ottomans were also plagued by truly abysmal morale: such a long-running affair required home leave and when home leave was granted exclusively to Janissaries in 1649-1650, against the advice of the commander (Deli Huseyn Pasha), the reaction from the regular Ottoman troops roughly mirrors that of the French mutinies in WWI -- they refused to fight, except on the defensive, and stubbornly resisted all attempts to convince them to fall back in line. At least until they finally got their leave. \n\nOver the course of the siege, the Ottomans and Venetians shot cannonballs at one another. Late in the siege, the Ottomans looked at this enormous pile of Venetian cannonballs they had been collecting and presumably said, \"wouldn't it be funny if we shot these things back at them?\" And so the Ottomans casted new cannon in the field (this wasn't *terribly* common in the 17th century but when you've got a 21-year siege you tend to get creative), loaded them with Venetian cannonballs, and shot the Venetians' own cannonballs back at them. \n\nIt's not a coincidence that the Ottomans casted three new cannon in 1668 for the approximately 30,000 Venetian cannonballs they had on hand and that the siege, which had by then dragged on for two decades, would end the next year. \n\nAs for why the they're explicitly mentioned as having \"collected\" this frankly ridiculous number of previously useless cannonballs fired from enemy guns, I can't even begin to guess. Rhoads Murphey, who generally offers all sorts of explanations for weird events like this, is regrettably silent on the issue (and the quote in Turkish he cites doesn't appear to offer much more information, though my Turkish is probably about as good as a three year old's). </p>",

                "answer": "<p>**Judas Iscariot, Atilla, Napoleon Bonaparte and the Mongols** were probably the most hated people. \n\nI apologize in advance if using Biblical figures does not count as 'historical.' However, prior to the 19th Century, European culture was especially steeped in Judeo-Christian and Hellenistic theology. All of the characters from the Bible were well known to the intellectual elite (and likely the lower classes as well). In fact, allusions to the Machabees and Israelites were very common, so much so that kings such as Karl XII, Richard the Lionheart, or Oliver Cromwell preferred to see themselves compared to such figures instead of 'lesser' known figures from their own national histories. It is interesting to note that while figures such as Darius, Xerxes, Pilate and Atilla were remembered throughout Europe, none were particularly hated, with the arguable exception of Atilla, who was considered both barbarous and cruel.\n\nThe Bible, as is well known, is populated by many notorious figures, but the blackest of all were traditionally Pharaoh and **Judas Iscariot**. Both of these figures, especially the latter, were featured in allegories such as the Divine Comedy. Genocide was not particularly the blackest sin of that era; instead, treachery was. Judas' crime against his Lord and God were seen as particularly heinous. \n\nBecause of the costs of their conquest, **the Mongols** were hated and despised by most of the intelligentsia of Imperial China. Even the Qing elite, foreign conquerors themselves, considered the Mongol Yuan to have been a cruel dynasty (edit, Source: Chinese Revolutions, Fairbank). I do not know about the Muslim world, but it is very likely the Mongols were as much hated as they were in early Muscovite Russia. Due to the characteristics of the era however, Genghis Khan was not particularly well-known by name in places such as Iran or China. The Mongols were hated as a race demonic in the Islamic-Christian theology; their individual leaders were not accurately remembered. \n\nAfter the Treaty of Vienna in the early 19th CE, I think that in most of the British and European world, **Napoleon Bonaparte** was remembered harshly as a tyrant. Many of the characteristics of Hitler, such as vanity, selfishness, despotism, callousness, cruelty, were subscribed to Napoleon, albeit with far less merit. However, memories of Napoleon as the archetypal villain were erased in both the Soviet and English Commonwealth by Hitler's actions. \n\nThe great difference between Hitler, Tojo Hideki, or Mussolini and other historical figures is that while the former are hated almost universally, memories of former rulers in their own native lands were almost always more nuanced (quite like a more recent dictator, Stalin's own ambiguous reputation). Vlad the Impaler, Ivan the Terrible, Atilla the Hun, Napoleon, and Genghis Khan were in hindsight remembered by their own nations as rulers who brought power and strength to their nations. Of course some reputations varied; France in particular held ambivalent feelings towards the Bonapartist political strain. It must be remembered also, that cross-national opinions varied far more in the past than at present. America and Latin America did not view Napoleon half as harshly as did England or Russia. He was often remembered instead for his progressive political position and military talents, instead of the various crimes of his wars. Therefore, there was no true universal villain prior to 1945 (and as others have mentioned, Hitler is less well known in Eastern Asia, although I would challenge the assumption that he is completely forgotten, especially in Japan). </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I'd also like to add that **Timur-e-Lang**, known as Tamerlane out West, was also largely vilified in the Near East from Georgia to Delhi for his brutality, sacking of major cities like Baghdad and Delhi, and frequent use of genocidal massacres. W.D. Rubinstein's *Genocide* recounts how he razed the Christian city of Tikrit and killed every Christian inside (though he also killed many Jews, Shi'ites, non-Abrahamic peoples, etc.). In fact, his campaigns are the primary reason the Nestorian Church of the East was nearly eradicated. As such, he is fairly universally hated in much of the Middle East by people of all religious and cultural backgrounds, with the exception of his native Uzbekistan, where he is the national hero. There are accounts of how he would destroy cities and kill everyone except the artists, who he would send back to his capital Samarkand to improve its aesthetic appearance.\n\nHis general obscurity in the west (despite the fact he killed numerous Europeans, such as the great beheading of Hospitaller Knights at Smyrna) can be attributed to the fact that Timur was himself an enemy of the Ottomans, who, at the time, had rapidly conquered most of Anatolia and were encroaching on Europe. Bayezid \"the Lightning\", the Ottoman Sultan, was captured by Timur and held in captivity until he died, and the nations of Europe had a sort of grudging respect for Timur for defeating their common foe. As such, their tends to be less hate for Timur in Europe than in the Middle East, but his reputation as a warmonger endured in art, where many operas and paintings of Timur and his deeds are depicted.\n\nThere's also that apocryphal story of the Soviet excavation of Timur's tomb in WW2, where (I think it was Marozzi's *Tamerlane: Sword of Islam, Conqueror of the World* that mentioned this) an inscription said \"Whoever opens my tomb shall release an invader more terrible than I\" was found...on the day that Hitler commenced Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It was said that the war went real south for the SU until Timur was reburied in Nov 1942, a few months before the Soviet victory at Stalingrad. Make of that what you will.</p>",

This law was more along the lines of codifying homosexual behavior that was pretty common at the elite level of Muslim societies at the time.\n\nSo this law in particular was enshrining what was a common elite practice in many Muslim societies. It seems crazy, given the Islamic world's reputation vis a vis homosexuality today, but the Islamic world has a long, long history with what you might call homonormativity. Using that term particularly is fraught, because historians working with gender argue that today's strict homosexual/heterosexual dichotomy, where you are either \"gay\" or \"straight,\" with no middle ground, is a construct emanating from mid 19th century Europe, and so using any of today's terms before that is dicey.\n\nI digress. In classical Islamic Persianate culture, beauty was ungendered. The sort of words one might use to describe beauty could be equally applied to women or young, beardless men. I'm using the term Persianate to refer to Islamic societies that were heavily influenced by Persian language, society, and culture. Because of heavy Persian influence from the Abbasid Caliphate forward, the major early modern Islamic empires (Ottoman, Safavid/Qajar, Mughals) shared a relatively common culture, similar to the Latinate culture that united early modern Western Europe.\n\nIn Persianate cultures, all of them Muslim, it was very common for older men to romantically pursue younger, beardless men. Once a teenager started to show traces of growing his beard (his \"khatt,\" or line), he generally moved to the \"older man\" category, stopped being pursued, and frequently became a pursuer. There is a HUGE AMOUNT of poetry about this, usually tied deeply to Sufi philosophy- finding true beauty in the inpermanence of this world, sadness at what age and time does to us, and how different Allah and his love is compared to our transient existence. Remember, from the time a man hits puberty until his khatt starts to show is extremely limited. The Persian word for one of these young men was \"amrad,\" which sort of occupied a third gender space. In elite Persianate society, once you were fulfilling your reproductive duties in a heterosexual marriage, it seems that people didn't much care about what you did with your own private sexual life. You could get a bunch of female concubines and wives, and society was fine with that. You could spend your time chasing after amrads, and people were fine with that, too. There is a great list in Najmabadi's fantastic book on this subject of how official Safavid chroniclers list the sexual proclivities of various Shahs, totally without judgment. While elite practice is pretty clear, what was going on in lower rungs of society is a little more opaque. There is pretty decent evidence that lusting after amrads was passably acceptable in common society, as well.\n\nAnd lest you think this is a cultural artifact of pre-Islamic Persian or Greek culture (remember, the Muslims were reading Plato just like we are- if this description of older man/younger man coupling sounds familiar to you from the Symposium, that's not a coincidence!), and the fact that Sufis were normalizing homosexual love as part of a symbolic understanding of the sad impermanence of this world versus the perfect timelessness of Allah, they were also finding Quranic support for this. You are probably familiar with the Islamic description of paradise- every time there is a new terrorist attack, some Islamophobic guy in a Reddit thread is usually quick to make a joke about those 72 virgins. Well, in the Quran, the proper word for those virgins is \"hur,\" an eternally young female beauty. Those hur, have a counterpart, \"ghilman,\" who are eternally young MALE beauties. The sexual role of the ghilman is not explicit in the Quran, but the parallel descriptions and services listed for hur and ghilman certainly got later Muslim commentators going. Aligning their cultural practice with quotes from the Quran, plenty of Persianate Muslims were pretty sure there were serving girls AND amrads awaiting them in paradise.\n\nThis is already getting quite long. Ottoman society, as one heavily influenced by Persianate culture, had a lot of the same cultural practices going on, and Ottoman poetry is rife with references to young, beloved, men. What changed to get us to today's world? That answer, you will not be surprised to learn, is complicated. There is a fair deal of argument about it, but the rough academic consensus is: Europeans. Muslims in the 19th century were made to feel VERY aware and self-conscious of anything they did that Europeans deemed \"backwards.\" Homosexuality in elite Muslim circles was most definitely something Europeans considered backwards. As Europeans penetrated the Muslim world, ever deeper, either economically (in the Ottoman Empire) or in full on colonialism (India, Egypt), they constantly commented on and tried to suppress these practices. Muslim elites, trying so hard to modernize their empires and societies to avoid being colonized, tended to adopt European mores along with technology and institutions. In this climate, the Ottoman decriminalization of homosexuality can be read as an act of resistance to European hegemony. The Ottomans were trying to preserve an old cultural practice while modernizing elsewhere. The practice was inexorably extinguished, however, as more and more European cultural practices and attitudes were adopted. As the practice was slowly extinguished in former Ottoman lands, modern Islamic fundamentalism came along with its radical reinterpretation of Islam and things like homosexuality, and replaced a lot of what I've been talking about here. And then, about a hundred years after browbeating the Ottomans and Persians into subduing homosexual practices, Europeans decided homosexuality was fine, sometime after the mid 1990s. And in a cruel historical irony, they browbeat Muslims for being anti-homosexual, after their great grandparents spent a century extinguishing a vibrantly homonormative society.\n\nNajmabadi's \"Women with mustaches and men without beards\" is the best, modern book on the subject. You will find an extensive bibiliography in it if you are curious! And do yourself a favor, go read some of Hafiz and Saadi's (both of Shiraz) poetry on \"beloveds!\"\n\nEDIT: Wow, this blew up! Thanks for the gold, kind internet stranger! I am also honored this fostered such erudite discussion in the comments, I hope I can make some time to go through and address it all! </p>",

                "answer": "<p>So firstly, a word on terminology. The Ottoman Empire didn't decriminalize homosexuality in 1858, it decriminalized consensual sex between males. Consensual sex between females had been theoretically decriminalized since 1545, with the creation of the criminal code of Kanun\u012b Sultan S\u00fcleyman, or S\u00fcleyman the Lawgiver (alternately S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent). The legal status of \"homosexuality\" as a concept is much more expansive than sex acts -specifically anal penetration- between males, encompassing rights and freedoms for people of all genders such as, legal recognition of relationships, the ability to raise a family, religious sanction, access to education, healthcare, and cohabitation, freedom from violence, the ability to congregate, and more. \n\n\nBased on my masters research, there is hardly any scholarly evidence in English whatsoever that points to the motivation for decriminalization of anal sex between men.  Though I cannot substantiate this theory without further research, it is possible that such decriminalization was the result of Abd\u00fclmacid's importation of French law, as it served as his model for the 1858 Criminal Code. G\u00fclnihal Bozkurt, who has catalogued the various European codes adopted by Ottoman reformers, points out that the 1858 Ottoman Criminal Code  was based on the French Criminal Law of 1810. France decriminalized sodomy in 1791. \n\n\nBozkurt also catalogues how the Ottoman Criminal Code was further reformed in 1911, this time based on the Italian Zanardelli Criminal Code. In the south of Italy sodomy had been decriminalized since the adoption of the Napoleonic Code in Sardinia. It was legalized in the North of Italy in 1889 with the Zanardelli Code. Sodomy was never re-criminalized in the Ottoman Empire, nor in the newly established Republic of Turkey, which used the Zanardelli Code as the model for its 1926 Criminal Code, and none of the laws in operation in the Middle East regarding sodomy seem to stretch back to older Ottoman regulations. \n\n\nThe Ottomans and later Turks borrowed provisions from a number of countries, among them Switzerland \u2013 which criminalized sodomy until 1942, and Germany \u2013 which did so until 1969, though not in their criminal codes. Still, it is unclear whether or not the importation of the French and Italian criminal codes were purposefully chosen to accord with the Ottoman position on sodomy and female same sex relations as non-offenses.\n\n\nWith respect to your second question regarding the justification for these changes in an \"Islamically-based\" system of law, the answer goes back to the notion of kanun vs. \u015feriat. Here \u015feriat(I'm using the Turkish word purposefully) refers to the prevailing interpretations of sharia in the Empire during the period in question, while kanun relates to law more generally. Some scholars have used model of opposition to explain the difference between these two concepts, with one relating to \"secular\" law, and the other to \"religious.\" This is wrong, not only because it imposes an anachronistic binary on the past, but because kanun itself is based on and often incorporates \u015feriat.\n\n\nDror Ze'evi  argues that beginning with Mehmet II, or Mehmet the Conqueror, who ruled from 1444 \u2013 1446 and again from 1451\u20131481, there was a concerted effort to bridge \u015feriat with state law into a hybrid system. The \u0125anaf\u012b madhhab (a sort of school of jurisprudence within Sunni Islam), which prevailed in the empire, recognized the need of states and rulers to legislate kanun for their subjects' welfare on the condition that they did not contravene specific Islamic injunctions, a concept known as s\u012by\u0101sa shari'yya. Moving into the 15th and 16th centuries more room was made for the sultan's laws within the \u015feriat, and judges were charged with applying both forms of law at the same time, often even within the same court decision. In theory the \u015feriat was supposed to prevail whenever there was a contradiction but this was not true in practice.\n\n\nAmr Shalakany troubles this history somewhat with his contention that s\u012by\u0101sa shari'yya was well-established before Mehmet's time but that's somewhat of a digression. \n\n\nBetween 1534 and 1545, Kanun\u012b Sultan S\u00fcleyman created his own criminal code as part of a larger effort to systematize law in the empire. Again, according to Ze'evi, judges were supposed to act in accordance both with the \u015feriat  and the kanun, so that when the strict rules for evidence in \u015feriat courts could not be met, kanun regulations were imposed. In the realm of \u201chomosexual zina\u201d (illicit sexual relations outside of marriage between people of the same sex) same-sexual acts between females were effectively decriminalized with this iteration of kanun, whereas for males the following rules applied: minors engaging in sex together were subject to punishment and a fine although children who \u201cyield to a pederast\u201d must be chastised and their fathers should pay a fine, unmarried males were fined progressively depending on their income, and married males were subject to the same scale but with a larger fine. Notably, \u201chomosexual\u201d and \u201cheterosexual\u201d zina carried the same punishment. Ze'evi hypothesizes that these changes were the result of an effort by state bureaucracy to regulate and control sexuality as a source of unrest, especially because the \u015feriat, with its high barriers to conviction, was inadequate in dealing with these issues. Semerdjian seems to share this view. In this way, although the punishments for zina are more severe in the \u015feriat than in the kanun, the ease with which a conviction could be attained by utilizing the kanun meant that regulation effectively increased during this time (at least in theory), especially because criteria for punishment under the kanun eventually came to encompass intent and opportunity, rather than pertaining only to the commitment of an illicit sex act as witnessed by two or four upstanding male Muslims (depending on the madhhab) as required by the \u015feriat.  In practice, very little is known regarding the rate of trial or conviction of same-sexual acts under either the kanun or  \u015feriat, and much archival research needs to be done in order to answer this question, which presents a unique set of methodological challenges itself.\n\n\nAs an aside, the status of same-sex sex acts in the various schools of jurisprudence or madhahib  (sing. madhhab) is variable, and more importantly, just because a particular madhhab takes a dim view of it, does not mean that that position was reflected in court. Many legal historians, among them Elyse Semerdjian, Leslie Pierce, and Amira Sonbol have compared juridical writings to court records in Syria, southern Turkey, and Egypt respectively, to demonstrate the gaps between the literature and actual rulings as they relate to gender. A similar analysis for same-sexual relations would be particularly valuable. Semerdjian's study of illicit sex in Ottoman Aleppo shows the rumblings of such a development, though it does not focus on same-sexual relations per se. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>*\"The Learned are all enamored of boys,\nNot one remains who female love enjoys.\"\n-Nedim*\n\nSpeaking first to the suspension of the Hadd (Islamic punishments); the Ottoman Empire had done this before, as had the second Caliph (a companion to the Prophet Muhammad) Umar ibn al-Khattab, although not actually for the decriminalization of homosexuality.\n\n[Quran 2:185](http://quran.com/2/185) allows for suspension of the law in exceptional situations. It speaks about adherence to Ramadan, and Allah's will that you be at ease and not take on undue burden to glorify God. Although the secular reforms of the Tanzimat, and the dire straits the Ottoman Empire found itself in was a bit of a stretch, this is the source of their justification. The duty of spreading laws across the empire was the responsibility of the Shaykh ul Islam (held by a couple individuals throughout this reformist period), who agreed that these new reforms were necessary in such times of turbulence and diminishing power for the good of the people. This idea of being for the good of the people (maslaha) is not part of sharia but general Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh).\n\nNow for the historical context! The Ottoman Empire has historically been a very pluralist society, accepting members of all walks and religions. Although there were certain restrictions such as the jizya (head tax on non muslims/dhimmi) the millet system of rule allowed for autonomous rule by fairly independent religious communities. However, during the 19th century the Ottoman Empire is faced with pressure from the inside and out, losing ground, losing power, and finding itself further and further behind the advancements in Europe. I'm not going to get to off track with the reasons for the reforms, but understand that the leaders of the Ottoman Empire were desperate for change, and were ready to accept significant reform.\n\nThe first of these was the Edict of G\u00fclhane (1839), it prescribed a few things including the right to life for all, but the most relevant piece is that despite it's reforms it still acknowledged Islamic principles and law. The Ottoman Empire continued to relieve itself of these religious restrictions though, including abolishing the death penalty for apostasy four years after the edict. The Ottomans as a whole though weren't that fanatic to begin with: \n> \"Throughout Ottoman history only one case of rajm (stoning) was decided and\n> carried out (in 1680). This happened in a period of extreme religious\n> fanaticism, and it encountered such opposition that it was not repeated.\"\n\nThe next big reform took place in 1856, known as the Imperial Rescript (Hatt-i Humayun). This is the one that decriminalized homosexuality. It completely removed any reference to Islamic principles and law. It's seen as having taken much of it's influence from the French and British who had just fought the Crimean War alongside the Ottomans. \n\nSo, why bother decriminalizing homosexuality? It was prevalent. While Europe often perceived the Turks as lustful and addicted to the filthy pleasures of pederasty, it was not to such an outrageous degree. In fact back in the 18th century a man Mehmet \"Efendi\" was traveling in Paris, and his hosts knowing he was a 'lustful turk' thought to show him what Paris had to offer in rentable boys \n> After being shown around the Palais Royal Marketplace at night he challenged the image of Turkey being especially notable for pederasty arguing that with, \"1500 boys exclusively occupied in sodomy\" and, especially shockingly, their availability and prices advertised on printed cards, it was far more blatant in Paris than anywhere in the Ottoman realm.\n\nIt did exist though and was simply addressed as part of secularization/reformation. The French, one of the greater influences on the 1858 Rescript had already done so in 1789. This also was solely applied to men because female sexuality was already decriminalized, it was often surmised that female homosexuality was prevalent in harems and bath houses. **However**, most of the sources on that are foreign assumption, and the well known Lady Montagu, one of the only(*?*) sources to actually enter a bathhouse, denied that it occurs in bathhouses during her first and only visit to one(which was her only mention of homosexuality in the entirety of her letters).\n\n I hope I was of some help though in expanding your knowledge of the subject.\n\n*\"When the rose[anus] holds carnival,\nThe tulip's[vagina] smartly shown the door.\"\n-Necati*\n\n**The Tanzimat:Secular reforms in the Ottoman Empire; A brief look at the adoption of Secular Laws in the Ottoman Empire with a particularfocus on the Tanzimat reforms (1839-1876), Ishtiaq Hussain**\n\n**Stephen O.

                "answer": "<p>There are a number of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, everyone needs salt. Salt deficiency is deadly, and the threat of salt deprivation has been a tool of state power in salt-poor countries since antiquity. If you eat a lot of meat, you probably get all the salt you need to live from other animals. But, until relatively recently, meat was a relative luxury and it would not be possible for common people to live on the salt in meat alone. Salt was used as a medicine, for ritual purposes, and for literally thousands of industrial purposes.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, salt preserves. If you're standing in Barcelona holding a dead tuna, its market value is determined by what someone within about five miles of you is willing to pay for it. *But,* if you're standing in Barcelona holding a dead tuna and a kilo of salt, suddenly its market value is determined by what someone *anywhere on earth* is willing to pay for it. If you can't find a buyer, shove it in the cellar and wait for the market to change, or don't sell it at all and eat it a year from now, when it will have lost little or no of its value. You've turned the transient, local, rapidly-declining value of your fish into permanent, global, stable value instead. \n\nThis massively increases its potential value and shows the true value of salt in the pre-modern world: turning locally-tradeable, perishable goods into globally-tradeable, nonperishable goods. This is why salt was able to account for, at various times, 60% of the cargo on the Erie canal, 50% of the French king's income, and the primary state revenue source in Imperial China.\n\nUnfortunately, anywhere on earth that does not have a coastline on the ocean or a salt lake does not have the option of evaporating seawater as you suggest. These places generally relied on either mining, brine springs, or trading with coastal areas. But salt is heavy and bulky, and, unless no local option was available, overland trade was generally an impractical way to move salt around until the extensive canal-building in Britain, France, and the New World in the 1800s.\n\nMoreover, not everywhere with a coastline is appropriate for salt production. For one thing, not all parts of the ocean are equally salty, and many are too brackish for salt production to be economical. Also, in temperate climates, just leaving out a big pan of brine will never produce reasonable returns, because cool weather, high humidity, still air, and rain will nullify any progress.\n\nSo, coastal salt-producing areas had to have:\n\n* Highly saline water\n\n* A warm, windy climate\n\n* Little rainfall\n\nand, perhaps most importantly,\n\n* Access to trade routes\n\nSome areas, such as Sicily, the Po Delta, and the Bay of Biscayne are admirably suited. Others are not. Probably the best example of a bad place to make sea salt is Sweden: bordering the brackish Baltic, with a cool, wet climate and long winters, medieval Sweden was forced to either import foreign salt or suck up the slightly more saline deep-baltic waters with vast pipes made from hollowed-out tree trunks, which they would then boil down over wood fires. This consumed even *more* fuel, and soon much of Sweden was deforestation in the name of cheap salt, which drove prices up and forced the country to rely on imports. In the late middle ages and renaissance, many writers spoke of timber shortages the way people today talk about fossil fuel depletion - ie as a strategic resource that had to be conserved for the good of the state. Thus, brine boiling was impractical in all but a few places.\n\nWith 19th century technology, salt production spread somewhat further into temperate areas. Cape Cod and Upstate New York became the salt cellars of the new American republic, reliant of complex covered vats that allowed evaporative salt production in cool northern climates. The vats worked, but they depended on massive manpower to open and close them at the slightest indication of inclement weather. Meanwhile, in the American south, saltworks were able to operate more cheaply due to slavery. In spite of this, the South lagged far behind the north in salt production, and used the vast majority of imported salt. These works - both in the north and south - were only active for a relatively short period of history between the development of temperate-climate evaporation vats and the massive increase in salt mining brought about by 20th century technology, which made them obsolete.\n\nSome parts of the world got lucky, and were able to do exactly as you suggest. In the Sichuan province of China, for instance, underground brine was often found alongside pockets of natural gas. After some trial-and-error, pre-imperial Chinese succeeded in harnessing natural methane seeps to make gas burners, which cooked down brine to a valuable salt. This, combined with its extensive network of rivers, made Sichuan China's salt basket, and one of the few places where the method you suggest was used on a large scale.\n\nFinally, the \"salt was worth its weight in gold\" thing is *probably* a myth. It is certainly true that salt was traded *for* gold, but whether their per-pound values were ever equal has not been established.  The misconception likely arose from the Saharan habit of silent bartering, wherein traders would stack up goods on a bartering mat, each adjusting the size of his pile until an agreement was reached. Negotiations could take days, and often the two participants never saw one another. European travelers saw salt-for-gold deals in negotiation, and assumed a parity of value where probably none existed.\n\nSources:\n\nKurlansky, Mark. *Salt, a World History*\n\nWulf, Andrea. *The Invention of Nature*</p>",

It is also important to examine the extent of political repression under Castro, and to put that in the context of the political and social situation in pre-revolution Cuba. \n\n#Social Progress\n\nLet's look at healthcare more specifically, since that is often lauded of communist Cuba's [greatest achievements](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/salim-lamrani/cubas-health-care-system-_b_5649968.html). [Just prior to the revolution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564047), Cuba had an infant mortality rate of 60 per 1000 lives, a maternal mortality rate of 125 per 1000 births and a life expectancy of about 65 years. The linked source mentions that by 1988, infant mortality had fallen to 15 per 1000 (compared to the contemporary 9 in the OECD and 22 in the Soviet bloc, and 54 in the rest of the Caribbean), while maternal mortality fell to 77 per 1000 births. Today, Cuban life expectancy is [among the highest in the world](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Cuban-Life-Expectancy-Among-the-Highest-in-World-at-78.45-Years-20150526-0011.html) at around 79.5 years, [compared to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) the UK's 81.2 years and America's 79.3. Furthermore, Cuba has played a big role in medical development, exporting some $120 million worth of drugs in 1995 and being praised even by such conservative sources as The Economist for its medical establishments which \"have made breakthroughs in vaccines, immunology and biotechnology\"^1 . \n\nAdditionally, Cuba has made outstanding educational progress under Castro. Pre-revolution, it is estimated that a quarter of the nation was illiterate, yet by 1961, only a few years after the revolution, UNESCO [had confirmed](http://monthlyreview.org/2011/07/01/cuba-education-and-revolution/) that basic illiteracy was essentially eradicated from the nation thanks to an intensive educational campaign. Today, the average Cuban citizen [can expect](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/mean-years-schooling-adults-years) to spend 10 years in schooling, compared to roughly 13 for the US and less than 8 in the average Caribbean nation. \n\nSo, Cuba achieved significant social gains in the decades since the revolution, and significantly, **achieved much greater gains in social welfare than other Caribbean nations aligned with the US**. But at what cost? Was the political repression worth it?\n\n#Political Repression\n\nThere's two factors to look at here: what was the political situation like before Castro, and how bad repression under Castro actually was. From 1952 until 1959, the year of the revolution, Cuba was ruled by a [military dictatorship](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~jidoming/images/jid_batista.PDF) under one Fulgencio Batista, who staged a military coup when it was clear he was about to lose the election in 1952. Under his rule, somewhere around 20,000 people were killed by the state^2 , while presiding under an economy that was an increasingly unequal and impoverished nation^3 . The most critical thing to understand here was that at this time, the Batista regime was supported both by the [official US government](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/books/backing-the-wrong-tyrant.html) and by private American interests, which according to President Kennedy, came to [\"dominate the Cuban economy\"](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25660): \n\n>At the beginning of 1959 United States companies owned about 40 percent of the Cuban sugar lands\u2014almost all the cattle ranches\u201490 percent of the mines and mineral concessions\u201480 percent of the utilities\u2014practically all the oil industry\u2014and supplied two-thirds of Cuba's imports.\n\nAll this together paints a portrait of pre-revolutionary Cuba at least as repressive as Castro's regime, and more importantly of a repression sponsored by American public and private interests, especially private firms that saw Cuba as a source of cheap profit.\n\nGiven this situation, the violence and repression of Castro's regime becomes more understandable, if not justifiable (especially in more recent times). Especially early on, repression could be understandable if neighboring superpowers are [actively attempting to overthrow your government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion) and [assassinate your leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Fidel_Castro). Just earlier today, Human Rights Watch put out [an excellent summary](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/26/cuba-fidel-castros-record-repression) of Castro's dismal human rights record, which included arbitrary detainment and incarceration, widespread intimidation, state control of all media sources and a crackdown on all other political movements and a wide range of activists. Looking at the broader history of the revolutionary government, some scholars [estimate](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB15.1B.GIF) that there have been some 15,000 state killings in Cuba since the revolution, only a small minority of which were prisoners lawfully condemned to death by the justice system. Today, Cuba remains the [only nation](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2016) in the Americas rated as \"not free\" by Freedom House, a largely US-government funded NGO. \n\n#Conclusion\n\nSo how was daily life under Castro? Especially in more recent times, relatively peaceful (the last execution was carried out in 2003, with no extrajudicial killings on record), and with most repression being limited to the [jailing of a few hundred activists](http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/mar/22/raul-castro/are-there-political-prisoners-cuba/). The average citizen is still highly restricted in their political activity, and still sees a [low standard of living](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/426334/cuba-working-class-communism-castros-poverty) in comparison to most nations. However, education and healthcare remain stellar, and other basic indicators of development are decent, currently placing Cuba [in 67th place](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CUB) for its Human Development Index. It should be noted that on the [overall rankings](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI), this places Cuba above nations like Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica and Belize, but below Panama, the Bahamas and Argentina. \n\nSo what's the conclusion? I'll leave that up to other users. I'll admit to writing up a somewhat pro-Cuba narrative here on the whole, a deliberate decision given many Americans' instinctive negative reactions to Castro. I encourage everyone to draw their own conclusions from the facts I have provided, and do your own research into the topic as well. Given the historical context of Cuba ahead of the revolution, it wouldn't be wrong to view Castro as a sort of liberator from an objectively awful regime. Furthermore, his oppression could be justified to an extent as a necessary countermeasure to the political meddling of the United States. However, Castro has still led a nasty regime at times, albeit nowhere near the scale of someone like Stalin or Hitler. Under Castro, Cuba has seen impressive accomplishments in social measures of education and healthcare, but its citizens still see a relatively low standard of living and constant political repression. Judge these facts as you will.\n\n**EDIT: Formatting and assorted typos.**\n\n**EDIT 2: Thanks to /u/Lich-Su for [pointing out](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5ez8b2/was_fidel_castro_a_good_guy_for_lack_of_a_better/dah2of7/?context=3) one really big point on Castro I missed, namely his really cavalier attitude towards the Cuban Missile Crisis, where he basically recommended to Krushchev that the missiles be launched, and that the Cuban people were ready to sacrifice everything for the ideological cause. We've had enough boring academic sources so far in this comment, so [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHVpuhApSC0&ab_channel=ArmageddonLetters)'s a fun little video by the Armageddon Letters Project that elaborates further and explores Castro's potential internal motivations for such a mindset.**\n\n**Special addition: to better help you folks judge the \"goodness\" of Castro's regime, please see some selected details from his foreign policy in a child comment.**\n\n---\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n1.

Cuba is complex, and so is \"good\".\n\n--\n\n\nA good example is the fact that the fidelista regime embarked on a incredibly successful war against illiteracy early in the revolution, but this can easily be interpreted as a way of normalizing and spreading anti-imperialist sentiment and revolutionary culture to the countryside while allowing young urban cubans to take part in the revolution, as mythos had put such a heavy importance on the actions of the small group of sierra maestra rebels.\n\nThe early fidelista regime was populist, and dynamic. Castro was often criticized by the Soviets and PCE members for literally performing his duties out of the back of a jeep. There was no \"if stalin only knew\" in Cuba. Castro did know, and he was sometimes there taking notes. On the other hand, Castro was careful to not let any of his power slip into the hands of the people. A few see this as an result of Fidel's elitism, not malice. \n\nThere were no massive purges, but many are happy to point out that geography may contribute to that fact more than Fidel. At the onset of the revolution, much of the opposition fled the country fully expecting the revolution to fail in a few weeks or months. \n\n--\n\nHope that's an okay place to start. Let me know if you have questions or think of specific things that would define him as good or bad.\n\n\n--\n\n\nSources:\n\n*Cuba under Castro: The Limits of Charisma* by Edward Gonzalez\n\n*From Utopianism to Institutionalization* by Antonio Blanco and Medea Banjamin\n\n\n\n*The Literacy Campaign* by Oscar Lewis, Ruth Lewis, and Susan Rigdon \n\n\n*Looking at Cuba: Essays on Culture and Civil Society* by Rafael Hernandez\n\n*Revolution Within A Revolution: Women and Gender Politics in Cuba* by Michelle Chase\n\n*Visions of Power in Cuba* by Lillian Guerra</p>",

Myself, I believe that he was a \"decent guy\" due a few issues with freedom of speech and representation. But let's look at a few policies of his that led me to think of him as a \"decent guy\". \n\n\n\n**Internal Policies**\nWhen Fidel came to power he was at the head of a nation that not only just been through an internal struggle for revolution, but had been under a dictatorship for the last seven years. Batista (said dictator) was in the pocket of US big business and gave little care to the average Cuban citizen; wages were low, infant mortality was high, and a sizable portion of the population was functionally illiterate. Within a decade of the revolution Castro had effectively wiped out illiteracy, nationalized much of the foreign lands and businesses, revamped healthcare, and raised the quality of life for the average Cuban. \n\nThis however did come with some rather draconian power consolidation that can be seen in other revolutions. Political dissent was outlawed, people disappeared in the night, media became state controlled, and there were executions of Batista/old guard supporters. Along with this Castro later on would set the economy on a state controlled path which while lowering unemployment, disallowed private means and at times caused economic crisis which can be seen in other state run economies. Eventually the government became semi-reliant on subsidies from the Soviet Union and once the bloc fell, so did the funding for many of the Cuban government programs. \n\n\n\n**Foreign Policy**\nTo simplify Cuban foreign policy I will summarize the two dominant issues that were always on the Government's list; US Relations & Global Revolution. \n\n\n\n*US Relations* \n\nUnsurprisingly the United States wasn't thrilled about having a communist state 90 miles away and while their relationship wasn't always hostile for the majority of the Castro government the US would actively try to depose Castro via counter-revolution or assassination. In return, the Cuban government aligned with the Soviet Union who through monetary support and preferential trade deals allowed Cuba to muscle through the US imposed embargo. \n\n *Global Revolution*\nCuba actively took part in spreading the ideals of Communism and anti-imperialism throughout the world, at times even going against the advisement of the Soviet Union. Military involvement includes various Latin American civil wars, Granada, and the Angolan Civil War, the latter of which the most important. When not in direct involvement (i.e. boots on the ground) the Cuban government would often send arms and money to support a cause. \n\nNot all Revolution spreading though was violent, Cuba has been a very charitable state given it's own personal means. Cuban doctors are frequently sent around the world to endemic hot spots and impoverished countries and their medical school sponsor the studies of many students from said impoverished countries. This along with support with support in infrastructure to those in need has given Cuba very good relations around the world. \n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is all of course a great oversimplification of the past 50-odd years of Castro's rule. The man was far from perfect and often took rough measures to hold onto power which to outside observes would seem harsh. But with frequent US attempts to overthrow him and with the crash of major trading partners in the 1990s, Castro seemingly always had the nation's best interests in mind. It will still take decades I think for a better picture of his time in power to be made but in all, he was far from a \"bad guy\", more often than not his negative image is a product of US propaganda. \n\n\nSources: Odd Arne Westad's *The Global Cold War*, Jay Mallin's *Covering Castro: Rise and Decline of Cuba's Communist Dictator* \n\n</p>",

However, it's one I wouldn't begin to know how to answer. Thankfully, this is also one of the rare cases where a tough question has been answered previously by someone with... abnormal expertise. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1v7v10/were_bounty_hunters_around_in_the_wild_west_and/cepofei), /u/kingconani, who should really get around to just applying for flair already, says that dead-or-alive bounties didn't really mean what they said, where they existed at all. Instead, they were bounties for live delivery of a suspect -- like you see rewards for tips leading to arrest today, except perhaps with justified detention.\n\nTo answer a question raised by /u/gameshot911, this could potentially raise due process issues. Due process, eh?  [Now the rubber band's on the other claw!!!](http://static3.fjcdn.com/comments/Now+the+rubber+band+s+on+the+other+claw+_d9cb64aa4059be8035919cbc4151d317.png) (To non-Futurama fans: \"That I can talk about!\")\n\nIn an early Supreme Court decision, the court appeared to bless abnormal, even extralegal bounty hunting tactics. Said the Court in *Taylor v. Taintor*, 83 U.S. 366 (1873): \n\n>When bail is given, the principal ***[Prisoner]*** is regarded as delivered to the custody of his sureties ***[the agents of his bail bondsmen]***. Their dominion ***[the bondsman's]*** is a continuance of the original imprisonment. Whenever they choose to do so, they may seize him and deliver him up in their discharge; and if that cannot be done at once, they may imprison him until it can be done. They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another State; may arrest him on the Sabbath; and, if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose. The seizure is not made by virtue of new process. None is needed. It is likened to the rearrest by the sheriff of an escaping prisoner. In 6 Modern ***[a treatise]*** it is said: \"The bail have their principal on a string, and may pull the string whenever they please, and render him in their discharge.\" The rights of the bail in civil and criminal cases are the same.[*] They may doubtless permit him to go beyond the limits of the State within which he is to answer, but it is unwise and imprudent to do so; and if any evil ensue, they must bear the burden of the consequences\n\nFrom this we learn that in some cases bounty hunters *connected to a bail bondsman* could go beyond the letter of the law, and arrest a prisoner who has skipped bail in situations where the government couldn't. This relaxation of the strict requirements of due process emerges, apparently, from the *contractual nature* of the bail arrangement. *See State v. Gonzalez-Fernandez*, 612 S.E.2d 148 (N.C. 2005). Where it continues today, this is a state-by-state rule, and seems to give some legal force, even today, to the notion of bounty hunters operating based on \"wanted\" posters depicting prisoners sought \"~~dead~~ ~~or~~ alive.\" It also squares the whole thing with \"due process.\" Sort of. But this sort of arrangement is limited, even where it exists, to the case of a petitioner who *skips bail* in a state that allows this type of thing. \n\nElsewhere, I've come upon a doctrine, called the *Ker*-*Frisbie* doctrine, which holds that \"the power of a court to try a person for crime is not impaired by the fact that he had been brought within the court's jurisdiction by reason of a 'forcible abduction.'\" *Frisbie v. Collins*, 342 U.S. 519, 522 (1952). There the Court held that a defendant blackjacked and abducted in Chicago by state offices, and haled to Michigan for trial, couldn't raise his abduction as a defense to prosecution. The Court also appeared to opine, though, that the Michigan authorities had violated *at least* a federal law by abducting the prisoner.\n\nThis suggests to me that \"wanted\" posters with bounties for *alive* prisoners might have been a thing, and might still be, especially in the context of bail. But it doesn't immunize the bounty hunter for crimes committed during the arrest. \n\n**TL;DR:** \"Dead or alive\" posters didn't mean what they said, on the strength of a comment from another post. Abduction to facilitate prosecution -- bounty hunting -- continues to this day, but might make a criminal out of the bounty hunter too. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I'll give this a try, since there seems to be quite a few misconceptions out there. I may not know all that much about the religious practices themselves, but I think I can at least lay out a few ground rules for discussion. I can't say too much about Christianity, but it is important to remember that Jewish Christianity and other forms of 'Judaizing' Christianity did exist (I have no idea whether they still exist or not, I know very little about religions in the present day), so we shouldn't really say that Christianity definitively abandoned this ritual. Like every faith, it is a broad church and from a historical perspective it doesn't always make sense to define it so narrowly. Strictly speaking there also seems to be an academic debate about the difference between Jewish Christians and Judaizing Christians,^1 but I don't really get it and frankly it won't make that much of a difference here, so I'll just use 'Jewish Christians' here to refer to Christians who adopted elements of Jewish belief, specifically circumcision given the discussion here. Who were these strange people? Well, they were named by early church fathers as heretics of various sort, but they can also be found in Ethiopia and, perhaps more intriguingly, in Arabia.^2 The debate about the presence of Jewish Christianity is Arabia is still ongoing, mostly because we have so little evidence, but it seems to me quite reasonable that they existed, even if not in any great numbers.^3 An interesting source is Sozomen from the fifth century, as he wrote an *Ecclesiastical History* that mentioned the curious behaviour of the Arabs:\n\n> This [the Arabs] is the tribe which took its origin and had its name from Ishmael, the son of Abraham; and the ancients called them Ishmaelites after their progenitor. As their mother Hagar was a slave, they afterwards, to conceal the opprobrium of their origin, assumed the name of Saracens, as if they were descended from Sara, the wife of Abraham. Such being their origin, they practice circumcision like the Jews, refrain from the use of pork, and observe many other Jewish rites and customs.^4\n\nNow, a Christian writer based in the empire probably had very little idea of what was actually going in Arabia and some of his ideas are just plain wrong - the claim that the term Saracen was derived from Sara for instance - but his mention of circumcision amongst the Arabs is certainly intriguing and is seen by some historians as evidence of Jewish Christianity in the region, since Sozomen did not describe them as Jews. The picture is further complicated by two earlier sources that provided two other explanations. One, the Jewish historian Josephus, noted that the Arabs practised circumcision because of their Abrahamic roots, whilst the Christian Epiphanius attributed this practice to a 'senseless custom'.^5 As far as I know there is no consensus tying all these things together, but it seems to me quite clear that at the very least, circumcision was already present in the Arabian peninsula regardless of Islam and was perhaps a custom amongst Jews, Jewish Christians, and even pagans. \n\nThis view is strengthened if we look at the evidence for pre-Islamic culture preserved in later Arab sources, which seems to suggest that circumcision was a fairly standard practice. Ibn Ishaq for example noted that rituals such as circumcision were performed before a statue of the deity Hubal in Mecca,^6 whilst circumcision itself is something that has been interpreted by a few historians more generally as a purification ritual for the people of Arabia.^7 This is where it gets tricky, since there is also no consensus about just what Islam was in the early seventh century. Perhaps it was very similar to the Islam we know today, but others have also suggested more interesting theories. Fred Donner for example argues that Islam was at the start an ecumenical apocalyptic movement that included both Christians and Jews alongside Muslim 'Believers'. In short, the theory goes that as the end of the world was nigh, it was imperative for all Abrahamic monotheists to purify themselves and do something about it.^8 Or we can go further and follow Patricia Crone's line, in which case practically everyone in Muhammad's life was already a monotheist and that his prophetic career was a struggle over different teachings rather than a bitter dispute over monotheism versus polytheism.^9 \n\nThis might not seem very relevant, but this I think gets to the crux of your question, especially as you asserted that Christianity was closer than Islam in its connections to Judaism. In light of these studies, I don't think that's correct. As I noted [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3p491t/when_did_the_byzantines_stop_thinking_of_islam_as/), Roman authors, all of them admittedly quite anti-Semitic, generally talked of a close connection between Islam and Judaism in their writings. Recent studies of the Arab conquests have also effectively made the case that Christians and Jews took part in the conquests alongside early Muslims,^10 so I would personally argue that Islam was at its heart closely connected to Judaism. Not that this particularly matters all that much, since as I've noted above, circumcision was already a thing in Arabia centuries earlier. The exact reasons behind it are debatable, but I think it would be reasonable to say that it's not all that strange that Islam required its practitioners to be circumcised. Even if we ignore earlier sources like Josephus and Sozomen, we can point to how Christianity and Judaism were key to the power struggles in Arabia of the sixth century (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3jirc1/how_would_muhammad_have_originally_known_so_much/)), and as later Arab sources all described Muhammad as an intelligent and well-travelled man who was no doubt aware of the diverse religious practices present in Arabia, it's a fairly short leap of logic to understand how easily he would favour circumcision. In these circumstances and with the rich Abrahamic inheritance this region already possessed in mind, the existence of circumcision in Islam is I think fairly understandable.\n\n--------------------\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

                "answer": "<p>I can only speak to the Christian half of your question and, unfortunately, there is not a great answer. The first thing to point out is that Christianity's relationship to Judaism is not so cut and dry. If you read in the New Testament (e.g. Galatians 2), there are lots of conflicts between those whose religious practices remains closer to Judaism and those who don't. This happens particularly over circumcision, but it carries over to diet as well. We get a few remarks from Paul (e.g. Romans 14:14) that indicate he may have been against ritual dietary laws, but he is more concerned with how to handle the eating of meat sacrificed in pagan rituals than he is the keeping of Old Testament dietary laws (e.g. I Corinthians 8). It is in Acts 10 that the New Testament gives the clearest address to this question, as there it recounts Peter receiving a vision from God telling him that no animal should be considered unclean.\n\nThe reality is that in the first few (two to three) centuries of Christianity, there was not a strong Christian / Jew dichotomy. Christian communities are generally considered to exist on a spectrum from highly distinct from Judaism to closely connected to Judaism. Much of this depends on their local context, i.e. the strength and composition of the Jewish community in that area, its relationship to the local government, etc. Two books which present compelling but opposing viewpoints on these issues are Daniel Boyarin's *Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism* and Thomas Robinson's *Ignatius of Loyola and the Parting of the Ways: Early Jewish Christian Relations*. They're both fairly dense, academic books, but worth a read to see how complicated this issue can be. I do not agree with Boyarin's ultimate conclusions, but he gives a good overview at the introduction of his book about the spectrum of Jewish-Christian religion that breaks down the Jew/Christian dichotomy. Robinson's work is an excellent case-study of Christian Jewish relations focusing on Antioch and helps the reader understand how local of a question this is.\n\nMy take based on their work and others is that out of the many different local Christianities arising in late antiquity, a strand of Christianity (given the relevant Scripture, probably Pauline, possible Petrine) that emphasized at least for Gentile Christians a decisive break with Jewish law and cult gained sway. Certainly, Pauline Christianity gave an intellectual framework for moving beyond Jewish law and practice. Christianity developed in such a way that Judaism was less and less a relevant cultural context for Christianity, and Christians found themselves less concerned with their relationship to Jews and more concerned with their relationship to dominant cultural social and religious norms.\n\nThere are other answers that have to do with the way Christians read the Bible, particularly the Old Testament, but I think this is a concise enough answer to help provide a way to think about the issue critically.</p>",

It has paper glued over to strengthen it, and it is filled with explosive gunpowder.  All is sealed up using more paper, with head and tail fixed on before and behind, and the two wings mailed firmly on both sides, so that it looks like a flying crown.\n\n> Under each wing there are two [slanting] rockets.  The fourfold fuse, connected with the rockets [and about a foot long], is put through a hole drilled on the back.  When in use, this is lit first.\n\n>[...]\n\n> The bird flies away more than 1000 ft, and when it eventually falls to the ground, the explosive gunpowder in the cavity of the bird is lit, and the flash can be seen miles away.  This weapon is used agains enemy encampments to burn them, but also at sea to set ships aflame.  It should never fail to bring victory.\n\nAnd there there was the Hellfire Missile of its day, the *Fei Gong Chi Zei Chen Tian Lei Pao* - rather awkwardly translated a lot of the time as the \"Flying enemy-pounding thunder-crash bomb\" - but we might somewhat more poetically (and **awesomely**) call just the **Thunderbird Missile.**\n\nIt was, as its name might imply less of a \"paper airplane\" than a rocket with some cursory paper wings attached for stability.  From *Science and Civilization in China, vol. 5: Chemistry and Chemical*:\n\n> There is another winged rocket-bomb, or rather grenade, in the *Wu Pei Chih*, the 'free-flying enemy-pounding thunder-crash bomb.'  A rocket-tube is contrived within the body of it, and when the wind is favourable the fuse is lit, whereupon it flies over to the enemy.  Then the rocket-composition is nearly burnt out, the charge automatically ignited, releasing poisonous and irritating smoke as well as water calthrops the thorns of which are tipped with tiger-poison.  The whole thing is no more than 3.5 in. in diameter, made of dozens of layers of oiled paper, but on each side it has artificial wind-borne wings which will take it, in suitable conditions, [right over a city wall.\"](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vb1LN96SEv4/Tgk0-Zq4qsI/AAAAAAAABNE/RaxWPTrOlXM/s1600/31692_387967007955_521452955_4027133_6542827_n.jpg)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>You will get lots of answers to this question, and your sources for information will vary depending on what historical period you are looking at. Fundamentally though, there are a few things you need to know that will make your life easier.\n\nFirstly is there is no such thing as 'pure facts', as most things are up for debate and actual 'facts' such as dates, names and general descriptions of major events are not hugely useful in understanding the period. Further, 'raw information', which in terms of history would refer to contemporary (that is, dating from the period you are studying), is also not necessarily useful to you as much contemporary material is subject to a wide variety of interpretations. For instance, just because Josephus says Roman drills are like bloodless battles and their battles are like bloody drills doesn't make it true: Roman tactics were not that mechanical.\n\nIt is essential that you understand the difference between primary and secondary sources, and what constitutes an appropriate secondary source. A primary source would generally a contemporary document or something written from the period. It is 'raw information' but it doesn't mean that everything written in it is true. It has to be interpreted by experts. This is what secondary sources do: interpret the 'raw' historical information, analyse it, and present it in a reasoned, academic manner. This does not necessarily mean secondary sources contain 'pure facts' either, as different historians will provide different interpretations or explanations for the topic at hand, and one or more of them may have validity.\n\nA 'valid' secondary source is not a website, not a news media site, not a blog, and not Wikipedia. All these forms of media must use real secondary sources, that is academic books, journal articles and papers, to come up with their arguments. None of these forms of media, even Wikipedia, tend to do that particularly well. That is because not all secondary sources are created equal: a book on Rome written by some guy is not the same as a book on Rome by Adrian Goldsworthy, but you get as many books by some guy as by serious academics on history shelves in bookshops. These non-academic publications tend to be written off with the usually-disparaging term 'popular history'.\n\nIf you're confused, then that's fine. Historians have to be trained in analysing primary sources and secondary sources combined with a lot of background knowledge in their specific period to be any good at producing a sound historical argument. Websites, blogs, news media and even Wikipedia generally do this badly.\n\n**So here is my own general method for researching a new topic that you can use, and will probably be broadly similar to what many other historians would do:**\n\n1- Read a general, accessible source on the topic. For me, that is Wikipedia. \n\n2- Look at the list of sources for the article on Wikipedia. Contemporary sources are the primary sources, which I would look at for the 'raw' information, but these must be read alongside the secondary sources, which are the books and journal articles. Generally, newer sources are better.\n\n3-Secondary sources are more important for understanding the topic, primary sources are often more interesting. Books are more interesting than journal articles and more informative for a beginner than primary sources. To make sure a book actually reflects good scholarship, use tips such as the following: google the author and see if they are actually a recognised historian with other publications, make sure the book has a significant bibliography and reference list, or run it through Google Scholar like /u/Akasazh suggested below.\n\n4- Using these methods to narrow down one or more good 'general' works on the topic, usually a book, find it, borrow it, buy it (I use [bookdepository](https://www.bookdepository.com/), it has free shipping), and read it. Once you have a general understanding of a topic from a good general book, you can go deeper.\n\n5- If you want to go deeper, read another book on a topic a bit more specific to what you're looking at. Find a published journal article of relevance. Concurrently with these things, look up the primary sources (which for ancient history are all online), and read parts or all of them so that you understand the references to the primary sources you will find in the secondary sources.\n\n6- To get a major headstart on all of this, you can **look at the [reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books) here on AskHistorians**, or you can post a question and ask for sources. Again, once you've read Wikipedia (which gives you the gist of an idea but also often contains outdated scholarship, crappy research and just plain made-up or mistaken stuff), you want a good general book on the topic.\n\n**Here is a more specific example of how to find a good book on a topic without professional guidance:**\n\nYou want to learn about the American Civil War. You start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War). Read the article. Scroll down to the bottom and look at the Bibliography. For the American Civil War, it is extremely large, probably one of the larger ones on Wikipedia. Look at all those names and books. There's so many! So just look at the ones where the name of the book describes a general history of the war: ignore anything without \"civil war\" in the title, ignore journal articles, ignore things that mention other topics aside from the US Civil War. There's a few options there. Shelby Foote \"A Civil War: A Narrative\" is the sort of title you're looking for. We also have \"Encyclopedia of the American Civil War\" by Heidler et. al. John Keegan's \"The American Civil War: A Military History\". McPherson's \"Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era.\" There's a few more. \n\nYou could probably read any of these books and get a good beginner's understanding of the war. But if you google the books and the authors, you'll find more information to help you determine which one you should be reading. Googling Shelby Foote's book tells you it's several volumes. Too long! Same problem with the Encyclopedia by Heidler et. al. (five volumes!). Keegan's book is very military focused, and googling the book gives [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/books/review/McPherson-t.html?pagewanted=all) review as the first result, which tells us a bit about the book's flaws. Keegan is not an American specialist, you would note by looking at his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keegan), where few of his publications specifically concern America. So finally, of the examples above, you could google McPherson's book. The book has a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Cry_of_Freedom_(book)) where can find it's written in 1988, which isn't *that* old for such a well-researched topic, we can find that it won a Pulitzer prize, and is a pretty well-regarded one-volume treatment of a complex period. So that's the book I'd be [buying](https://www.bookdepository.com/Battle-Cry-of-Freedom/9780195168952), though it's far from your only option. This is an example of the process I might use to pick an opening book for a new topic, and you can apply it to any topic that has a Wikipedia article really. \n\nI should add that this method will work better with more detailed articles with a wider array of sources in the bibliography. Shorter articles on niche topics may not have 'cutting edge' stuff in the references, but it will be better than nothing. Once you're a bit more practised at using google to check up on the quality of secondary sources, you can search for books yourself and use the same method to check them out, running them through google, checking the author's credentials, reading reviews, or checking the number of citations through Google Scholar.\n\nI hope this helps you. Again, if you're looking at a specific topic, reply in a comment and I or somebody else will be able to fairly easily point you to a good general book on the topic.\n\nEDIT: /u/granzi 's post on librarians is a good idea that has never occurred to me because I always had a University to guide me while I was learning. As he said, it is a really, really good idea to ask somebody knowledgeable about where to start. Almost certainly, they will recommend a well-regarded general book on the topic. \n\n/u/OakheartIX also gave a good summary on how to work with primary sources, if that's what you would like to do, in a post below.</p>",

Since you're not a trained historian, you'll want someone knowledgeable to make recommendations about books or articles you can read on the topics you're interested in. Once you've got a good grasp of the basics, you can move beyond introductory material to things like primary sources (stuff written by eyewitnesses or at the time of the event such as diaries and newspapers).\n\nEspecially at public universities, you may even be able to get borrowing privileges to check out books or get access to online databases.</p>",

Looking at how people understand the event that you are interested in is perhaps more interesting then a fairly futile search for truth, as what actually happened shapes people actions less then what the believed happened. \n\nIf that is unsatisfying I am sorry. As a Professor of mine said we can't really know what happened in the past. Even the people who were there didn't really know what happened due to issues with memory. So much of the work of the historian is gathering information that supports their argument and theory about what happened and deciding if that source is reliable. So it is important to read broadly on subjects you are interested in and think about what you read critically. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>No.\n\nI have written about this previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3yqab9/did_the_axis_medical_experiementation_nazi_and/cygqld1) and I will copy/paste my previous answer:\n\nUnfortunately I can't give you anything on the Japanese medical experiments (I have steered as clear of Unit 731 and the other medical experimental units of the Japanese as I can) but I can speak to Nazi medical experiments.\n\n**Edited to clarify:** I'm familiar enough with secondary literature on medical experiments and the developments of medical ethics (see Weindling's publication above) to be confident that Unit 731 did not produce good science but not knowledgeable enough on the subject to provide a detailed run-down. I sincerely hope an expert from among the user base or the flaired users comes along and provides more detail on this\n\n\nFirst off, contrary to popular myth - baffling that it is still around -, the Nazi medical experiments neither gave any significant advances nor were particularly scientific. These experiments were crimes under the guise of research.\n\n\nWe can divide Nazi medical experiments in roughly three groups:\n\n\n* Medico-Military Research\n\n\n* Racially Motivated Experiments\n\n\n* Miscellaneous Experiments\n\n\nTo start off with the latter two since with them it is easiest to dismiss them as what they were - useless junk science.\n\n\nThe **racially motivated experiments** consisted of the fertility research, the twin experiments, and the skeleton research. The fertility experiments, mostly conducted at Auschwitz and Ravensbr\u00fcck by Carl Clauberg and others mainly aimed at developing an easy, quick to do method for the sterilization of a large group of people. The idea was to develop a method of quickly sterilizing \"half\" and \"quarter\" Jews either by injection or by use of x-rays. Tested on hundreds of subjects under often appalling conditions, these experiments never came to fruition.\n\n\nThe twin Experiments were scientifically flawed from the onset as every doctor will be able to tell. Mainly, Mengel's idea was to study twins with such experiments like if changing the eye color of one twin would change the eye color of the other twin or how sew twins together to create conjoined twins.\n\n\nThe skeleton research is attributed to Dr. August Hirt at Strassburg University. He wanted a collection of Jewish skeletons in order to study how to find the skeletal markers for Jewishness. To that end several hundred prisoners from various camps were gassed or otherwise murdered for him.\n\n\nThe **miscellaneous experiments** concern mainly experiments in researching how fast a poison intended for executions would kill people or just timing how long it would take people to bleed to death. These often didn't even bother with a medical justification and can most certainly be qualified as \"just\" another way to kill Concentration Camp prisoners.\n\n\nThe **medico-military research** are probably those best known aside from Mengele's twin experiments. These consisted of submersing people in freezing water in order to study either how long they could survive and if there was a method of warming them again, putting people in decompression chambers in order to study the effects of pilots ejecting at high altitudes, giving people sea water to drink in order to study its potability, various wound experiments with either infecting people or trying to transplant nerves, and TB experiments.\n\n\nSeveral of those can be dismissed right out of hand because of their flawed basis such as the TB experiments where the responsible doctor, Hei\u00dfmeyer, sought to prove that TB was not an infectious disease but an \"exhaustive\" organism to which the \"degenerate body of Jews\" was more susceptible.\n\n\nSome of the others however, look when only regarded superficially as if there was actual scientific value in them. Most publicized are probably the Dachau hypothermia experiments conducted by Sigmund Rascher who also conducted the high altitude experiments since the former ones have the most material left and some researchers have tried to use their findings in journals and have been rejected for it. The hypothermia experiments are however also a good case to show why all this was rather bad science:\n\n\n* Flawed premises\n\n\nNazi doctors were Nazis. That meant that they were rather enthusiastic about Nazi racial theory. Often these studies were intended to prove Nazi racial theory or at least contained Nazi racial theory in their premises. As far as can be told, Rascher in the case of the hypothermia experiments, also thought that different groups were to be affected differently. Basically, if a Russian POW froze to death in a certain amount of time, that time had to be longer for a German.\n\n\n* Flawed experimental design\n\n\nTo start with the obvious: Concentration Camp inmates do not good subject for scientific study make. The bodies of malnourished, tortured, and previously almost worked to death people tend not to behave the same way as the bodies of healthy subjects. Also - and this being a pretty good indicator for how bad these studies really were - in Rascher notes we find no segregation between different groups. He basically just submerged people but never wrote down who was clothed, who was naked, who was unconscious, who was healthy etc. etc. as well as no record of how cold the water was. Also, no cardiological measuring or blood pressure taking took place. All this is pretty basic stuff for your run of the mill experiment but Rascher apparently didn't even bother to do that.\n\n* Flawed analysis\n\n\nThe analysis of the results by Rascher are inconsistent and allover the place. For some experiments, it is stated that the goal was not produce fatalities, for others it apparently was. References to standard nomenclature in connection to cardiac arrests is lacking. And Rascher in the end finds that it makes no difference if the water is 2\u00b0C or 12\u00b0C - something demonstrably false.\n\n\nAll these issues haunt the Nazi medical experiments. They were conducted without an orderly experimental protocol, with inadequate methods and an erratic execution, are riddled with inconsistencies and data falsification and also suffer greatly from the fact that for most of them full data was never published, let alone reviewed by anyone other than maybe Heinrich Himmler, who was not known for his strict scientific mind.\n\n\nAs for for the second point of what motivated these doctors to conduct such experiments, it is not easier to answer beyond the obvious that they were Nazis, really hated the people they experimented on, and maybe just wanted to try some stuff. The fact that even those like Rascher of whom at the end of the war it was thought that he was interested in results but used unethical methods, did in fact not only use unethical methods but hardly used any scientific methods at all, points to a motivation more influenced by Nazi ideology and personal cruelty. I mean, even with a scientific goal in mind, it takes a special kind of person to operate on someone without anesthesia and try to transplant a nerve while they are awake or to just dump someone in a decompression chamber.\n\nIn the end, their motivation was probably not very different from those of other Nazi perpetrators in that there was the deeply held believe that their subjects were degnerate and a danger to the German race and something had to be done about them resp. shit that they could do pretty much all they stuff they dreamt up to them.\n\nSources:\n\n* [Robert L.

                "answer": "<p>A few things. *Purpura* is not \"purple,\" it described a number of colors produced by two species of shellfish, which Pliny identifies as being *purpura* (or *pelagia*) and *buccinum*--ideally both types were used to produce the final dye. The resulting dyes came in a number of colors, depending on the shellfish used, the exact process of dying, impurities, and undoubtedly environmental conditions--part of the process involved steeping and exposure to heat. The best purple, \"Tyrian purple\" was called \"twice-dyed\" because the fabric was colored consecutively first with the *pelagiae* and then the *bucchina*. This generally produced not a purple or violet color, but an extremely dark reddish color (hence the frequent poetic use of \"purple\" to describe the color of blood) that had some kind of special shine as well. Besides this highly-prized color \"purple\" came in various shades between intense reds to violets and even greenish-blues--the specific use of the word *purpura* to describe the color English calls \"purple\" is a convention of later antiquity. \n\nNot all purple was Phoenician, and even among the Phoenician dyes some cities had better dyes than others. Tyrian twice-dyed purple was the best, because of its rich color, but a similar dye was Laconian purple, from Gythium in Laconia. It was not as good, but was apparently comparable. Further, cheap purples *were* produced by mixing blue and red dyes in different quantities--red madder dye (itself the cheapest kind of red--more expensive reds were produced from the kermes insect) could be dyed over woad to produce an imitation purple. But it probably didn't fool much of anybody, because of the peculiar qualities of real Tyrian purple and the variations in color that the dye exhibited--the defining characteristic of *purpura* was not so much a precise (usually reddish) color, but its sheen and richness, which was simply unparalleled because of the process. Further, even cheaper sources of poor imitation dyes could be found in certain lichens and bedstraw (a kind of plant, not like...actual straw...from your bed...). \n\nFinally, the expense of *purpura* in itself was part of the point. Sure, the dye was richer and more pleasing than most other dyes, but as an indicator of rank the color was all the more highly prized. The use of *purpura* on the *toga praetexta*, for example, was as much about the social status inherent in the dye as the color itself--strict social mores and legislation restricted the use of the color. That cost was not the only factor in the use of the dye is obvious--under the Severans the production of *purpura* became a state-controlled enterprise, and in late antiquity only the imperial household and magistrates were allowed to own any garments with the dye at all. The humiliation of being caught with an imitation dye, which were comparatively obvious to the eye, would have largely precluded its use among the social ranks allowed to wear it, and there was increasingly less interest in the dye among the rest of the population\n\nEDIT: So there's a lot of people who seem to be having trouble with the way that the process introduced variations into the dye, and it probably doesn't help that I haven't provided a detailed description of the manufacturing process. The best description is provided by Pliny, who says that *pelagiae* and *buccina* were to be caught alive, at a particular point just before spring, otherwise the dye extracted is of inferior quality--this passage has been much-discussed for some time, since it's not totally clear what Pliny means (he says, for example, that the dyers don't actually know this, which makes no sense). These shellfish (which are, yes, still extant--I believe they're both types of Mediterranean welk) had some kind of gland that had to be removed (either from the still-living animal or immediately after killing it). The resulting liquid would be salted, allowed to steep for three days (a point that Pliny is precise about), then heated for ten days--the apparatus that Pliny describes as used to heat the concoction is problematic, but it appears that it needed to actually be boiling (how it could be boiled in what had to be an open container--since the flesh and impurities that floated to the top were skimmed off--and not boil away after ten days is a mystery to me). The dye was then tested by dipping wool into it, and if the color was unsatisfactory could be boiled longer. It's not clear whether this process applied to both types of purple, since Pliny says that to make twice-dyed purple the cloth had to be dipped in uncooked (whatever that means) *pelagiae* before being treated with *bucchina*--the resulting color, Pliny says, was most valuable when it was the shade of congealed blood, and when held up to the light would shine somehow. Even with Pliny's fairly detailed description (which includes, to a certain extent, amounts of the ingredients), this is not a recipe, and it's hard to replicate. Besides that, it's easy to see how the dye might vary. Pliny is quite clear that the quality of the dye depended a great deal on the time of year, and slight variations in the process might have caused enormous differences--the process as described by Pliny had to be simultaneously quite exact (Pliny says that you must not let the liquid steep more than three days before heating it or it starts to lose the best color--surely a certain amount of eyeballing must have occurred) while being pretty open to the judgment of the dyers (hence Pliny's remarks about the dye having to be tested repeatedly). The fact that Tyrian purple was the product of two separate dyes is important as well--even the slightest variations in the composition of the dyes, the degree to which the wool soaked them up, and differences in the ratios (which could not have been exact, given that they're basically dunking the cloth) probably resulted in enormous differences in the color of the fabric--Pliny actually mentions dyes in which the two kinds of purple were mixed together and the fabric dyed only once, so considerable variation must have rested in the precise treatment of the two dyes together. There are other factors here as well. We don't know how exposed to air the concoction was, how long the dye was allowed to soak into the fabric, etc.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As u/XenophonTheAthenian mentioned, they did.\n\nThe most common method of creating \"false\" purple was a two-step dying process, where you would first dye fibers with woad (or indigo, but indigo itself was an expensive and highly prized commodity in Europe until well into the middle ages).  Then you'd dye them again with madder.\n\nThis practice was actually quite common.  There's an interesting study from 2010 that analyzes 18 tunics and dalmatics from Late Antique Egypt, all with purple decoration.  The analysis revealed that only *one* of these eighteen garments was dyed with shellfish-based purple.  The other seventeen showed no evidence of brominated indigotin or indirubin components from mollusk purple.  Instead, they all showed dye components indicative of a dye from the *Rubiacae* family--madder.  The 2010 study echoes the findings of other studies on Egyptian textile fragments.\n\nSo yeah, mollusk-based purple is the dye that Pliny describes in his *Naturalis historia.*  Yes, all those mentions of \"Tyrian purple\" or \"twice-dyed purple\" that show up in the Aeneid--and basically everywhere in Latin literature--are referring to mollusk-based purple dye.  However, these literary references to mollusk-based purple belie how common \"false\" purple actually was.  In late Antique Egypt, at least, plant-based \"purples\" were by far the most common.  There's also evidence for woad+madder overdeying in Iberia.\n\nBut then, the emphasis on mollusk-based purple in the literary tradition speaks volumes about how highly prized it was.  Mollusk purple was \"royal\" purple, and everything else was a cheap pretender.\n\n\nAs a side note, if anyone knows of any Roman/medieval textual sources for plant-based \"false\" purples, please let me know.  None of the articles that I've read have cited any, but I'd be interested to hear if you know of something.  u/XenophonTheAthenian, do you have a source for your point that imitation purple dyes would have been \"comparatively obvious to the eye\"?\n\nSources (I'll put these into proper citation format when it's not 2:30 am):\n\n* De Moor et al, \"Radiocarbon Dating and Dye Analysis of Roman Linen Tunics and Dalmatics with Purple Coloured Design,\" *Archaeological Textiles Review* 10\n* Thomas, Thelma K., *Designing Identity: The Power of Textiles in Late Antiquity*\n* Monnas, Lisa. \u201cSome Medieval Colour Terms for Textiles.\u201d In Medieval Clothing and Textiles, edited by Robin Netherton and Gale R Owen-Crocker, 10:25\u201358, 2014.\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>That's an interesting and really broad question, so I'll just deal with the Roman period. There were numerous factors protecting the bearers of bad news in this period.\n\nMessengers within Republican Rome itself to the Senate for instance could be anybody: they could be civilians carrying news from somewhere else. They may not have been citizens or even Latins so they did not necessarily have legal protection. For a start, the Romans, like everybody else were basically not in the habit of hurting or killing people who brought them news for the very practical reason that 'shooting the messenger' might mean you got no more (accurate) messages. Plutarch castigates Tigranes of Armenia for such a foolish act:\n\n>\"Since the first messenger who told Tigranes that Lucullus was coming had his head cut off for his pains, no one else would tell him anything, and so he sat in ignorance while the fires of war were already blazing around him, giving ear only to those who flattered him and said that Lucullus would be a great general if he ventured to withstand Tigranes at Ephesus, and did not fly incontinently from Asia at the mere sight of so many myriads of men.\"  (Plut. Luc. 25.1)\n\nIn the Imperial period, messengers within the Empire were usually soldiers, but they worked giving messages to Imperial authorities. As citizens they were both more and less vulnerable to being 'shot' as the messenger: they were subject to *disciplina militaris*, which denied many of the rights to safety and appeal of the civilian citizen, but on the other hand their being soldiers meant they could generally only be executed for a military reason, lest an official or officer upset the local soldiers, which could be very fatal for them. Mutiny was perhaps the Imperial soldier's most important protection from unreasonable violence from superiors. So 'shooting the messenger' was not a great option for soldiers either. I would not be surprised to find examples of certain Roman Emperors who are unpopular in the literature committing such an act (I can't think of any at the moment), but these would be looked upon with scorn by the writer and used as an example of that particular Emperor's bad character.\n\nFor the Romans, the reputation of their nation and the high status of their messengers might also protect them from harm. The story of Gaius Popilius Laenas single-handedly facing down Antiochus IV and his army in Egypt to prevent them from attacking the Ptolemies, a Roman ally, is instructive:\n\n>\"At the time when Antiochus approached Ptolemy and meant to occupy Pelusium, Caius Popilius Laenas, the Roman commander, on Antiochus greeting him from a distance and then holding out his hand, handed to the king, as he had it by him, the copy of the senatus-consultum, and told him to read it first, not thinking it proper, as it seems to me, to make the conventional sign of friendship before he knew if the intentions of him who was greeting him were friendly or hostile. But when the king, after reading it, said he would like to communicate with his friends about this intelligence, Popilius acted in a manner which was thought to be offensive and exceedingly arrogant.  He was carrying a stick cut from a vine, and with this he drew a circle round Antiochus and told him he must remain inside this circle until he gave his decision about the contents of the letter. The king was astonished at this authoritative proceeding, but, after a few moments' hesitation, said he would do all that the Romans demanded. Upon this Popilius and his suite all grasped him by the hand and greeted him warmly. The letter ordered him to put an end at once to the war with Ptolemy.  So, as a fixed number of days were allowed to him, he led his army back to Syria, deeply hurt and complaining indeed, but yielding to circumstances for the present.\" (Pol. 29.27)\n\nEven so, note the suggestion that Laenas acted arrogantly. Even in the ancient world, where harsh and threatening \"compellence diplomacy\" was the norm, this was pretty wild conduct (Eckstein, 2006, 173). Even between intense enemies, diplomats (usually Senators) seem to have been able to expect safety. See Hannibal in Spain blowing off the diplomatic party from Rome at the outbreak of the Second Punic War while in the process of attacking a Roman ally:\n\n>\"In the mean time, an account was received, that ambassadors had arrived from Rome; on which Hannibal sent messengers to the sea-shore, to meet them, and to acquaint them, that it would not be safe for them to come to him, through the armed bands of so many savage nations; and, besides, that, in the present critical state of affairs, he had not leisure to listen to embassies. He saw clearly, that on being refused audience, they would proceed immediately to Carthage: he therefore despatched messengers and letters beforehand, to the leaders of the Barcine faction, charging them to prepare their friends to act with spirit, so that the other party should not be able to carry any point in favour of the Romans. Thus the embassy there proved equally vain and fruitless, excepting that the ambassadors were received and admitted to audience.\" (Livy 21.10).\n\nEven while deliberately provoking Rome to war and fighting a siege, there is no suggestion that the diplomats sent to Hannibal would be threatened. On the subject of the Carthaginians however, they had a practice of crucifying unsuccessful generals, and the story goes that they tortured to death a captured Roman consul (Marcus Atilius Regulus) who broke an oath he had sworn to his captors. Even so, Rome still felt that it could send diplomats to their most aggressive general and expect safety. I would suggest that this meant it was the norm, no doubt through cultural values and norms rather than any rules or laws, there being no international legal system to enforce such a system even if it did exist.\n\nAt least in the early Republican period, there were more formalised forms of diplomacy such as the *fetials*, where a fetial priest would make his way to another Italian city, abuse the first enemy citizen he saw, and then make a song and dance in the enemy forum and demand reparations, which may or may not be actually achievable requests, and war would be declared in the aftermath if the demands weren't met. This was in order to establish divine approval for a war (Dawson, 1996, 124-5). Nowhere have I seen it suggested that the fetials would have been exposed to any danger. This is from an archaic period and I would not extrapolate this to later Rome or the Empire or Medieval Europe or anywhere else, but it is an example of how cultural norms (and religious deference) can render such 'messengers' quite safe even when carrying pretty unpleasant and aggressive tidings.\n\nUsing the logic I have already developed, as for messengers to somebody like Attila, I don't have the evidence to definitely answer that but I would suggest that only high ranking persons would be sent if any were sent at all. I am extrapolating this from Republican practice however. That said, if the Romans did not consider Attila to be a legitimate king, as he was a nomad, there was no reason the normal rules of war had to apply. It is my understanding that Roman *jus ad bellum* referred mainly to war between states, whereas war between Romans and any sort of rebels or traitors or some barbarian enemies, as Attila might be defined as, required no declaration of war, hence no delegation would need to be sent to Attila for the Romans to consider it a just war. Any messengers sent to Attila would have been in a diplomatic sense, and Attila for practical reasons could not harm such men: unless he wanted to just fight forever and never extract any official recognition or payment from the Empire, he would have had to accept diplomats and talk to them. If he hurt them they'd stop coming. Further, the purpose of war generally being to extract a formal surrender for the enemy along with concessions, diplomats and messengers of various shades were absolutely essential to achieve this. This had been the pattern of Hunnic warfare in the Eastern Empire in the early-to-mid 400s: invasion, extracting concessions, then leaving. Attila may have had grander plans, as evidenced by his attempt to marry Honoria, the sister of the Emperor. However this would make formal discourse and recognition more important to him, not less. Perhaps a true marauder with no imperial ambitions might be more violent towards foreign messengers (perhaps somebody like Tamerlane might be an instructive example?)*, but this was not a practical way of doing things.\n\nAs such, at least in the Roman period, I think messengers both within European states and to other powers were generally kept safe by a mixture of cultural and intercultural norms and practical considerations regarding the need for information and communication between warring powers. Exceptions to these norms perhaps only proved the rule, and would have been examples of outrageous (and probably impious) conduct in any case where it occurs in the literature, setting the perpetrator up for a fall later on. If anything, 'don't shoot the messenger' seems as if it would have been fairly practical advice in the Roman period.\n\n*And look at where murdering a few Mongol traders got the Kwarazemian dynasty!

                "answer": "<p>So there seems to be only one in depth look at the life of Allicocke, an article written by Donald A. Grinde, Jr. Several other sources make brief mention of him, which I've also tracked down for corroboration, but they are mostly little more than a paragraph of little detail. Grinde put in the real leg work, and is the main source I'm relying on, although I'll mention a few others.\n\nAllicocke first seems to have gained notice in the early 1760s, while working as a clerk in New York City, and there are records of him working as a supplier for the British military in that period - the French and Indian Wars - and specifically of wine shipments. His politicization seems to have come in the wake of the Stamp Act of 1765, and he quickly rose to be one of the leaders of the \"New York Liberty Boys\", aka \"Sons of Liberty\". With the repeal of the Stamp Act a year later, his role was honored with a 21 Gun Salute, and the honorific of \"General\".\n\nI would make an aside here, and shoutout to /u/sunagainstgold as we were looking into this in tandem. [Based on poor number of sources, there was question as to whether Allicocke was even black](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4tqfxf/joseph_allicock_is_the_only_founder_of_the_sons/d5jp2e6?context=999). SAG was able to track down Grinde's footnote, to John Montresor's journals which is perhaps the most solid primary source on the matter, clearly establishing Allicocke was of African ancestry, while further digging I found reference to his presence in New York and commercial activities in \"Hugh Hughes, A Study in Revolutionary Idealism\" by Bernard Friedman, noting his status as a merchant and Bergher of the city. \n\nI digress though. Over the next decade he returned to business, and in 1774 as tensions were again on the rise, he seemed to be a logical choice for New York's Committee of Correspondence, of which he was appointed secretary. This was a brief position however, and he resigned very soon after. There seem to be no writings of his to survive, and only a few records, but the inference of what info we do have indicates that he simply didn't support Revolution. He remained in New York even following British occupation and continued to conduct business in the city. An 1780 notice in the Royal Gazette implies commerce with Britain, and in 1781 his daughter married \"Capt. James Bonchier of the Raynham Hall, Indiaman.\" By 1783 though, it seems he left had New York, as \"James Griffith\" moved into his \"former residence\". \n\nThis all fits the model of a Loyalist. Grinde suggests that it \"may have reflected the fact that the British Empire had made steps in the late 18th Century to eliminate slavery while the American Revolutionaries, in order to forge an alliance with the Southern colonies, turned their back on the issue of slavery in spite of all the rhetoric of \"liberty.\"\" However, Friedman also notes that at that in 1765 Allicocke's business was doing poorly, and while he considered himself a \"Gentleman\" he was \"desperately clinging to illusions of gentility\". When involved with the Liberty Boys, Allicocke was doing poorly in business, and likely blamed this on the Stamp Act. Business seems to have been better for him by the 1770s, and it may have been business interests which at least played a part in his choice of loyalty, although in the end, there really isn't much to go on evidence wise, nor are those mutually exclusive interests anyways. As already stated, we don't have his writings, just small snapshots of an imperfect picture.\n\nWhatever his reasoning though, the simple answer is that he isn't ~~remembered~~ commemorated for the same reason Benedict Arnold isn't... we don't celebrate people who were Loyalists, even if they might have been on the \"American\" side originally. His decision to not join the Revolution is what consigned him to the footnotes of history, not his race (although as Grinde notes, the decision might have been about race itself).\n\n--------\n\nGrinde, Donald A.,Jr. 1990.

                "answer": "<p>The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World were so-called because of the magnificence of their creation. They were constructions that later men and women were in awe of; the work of ancient minds that operated on a grander scale than was thought possible. \n\nOriginally, they weren't called wonders at all, 'it was not as \"wonders\" that such monuments were first listed, but as \"sights\" - not, in the Greek, *thaumata*(wonders), but as *theamata*(things to be seen)'. To the ancients, they were the creations of contemporaries, and were essentially written about as an early form of tourist attraction. Travellers were told about them as marvellous things they should take in on their journeys. Many writers mentioned them in their texts, Herodotus being one of the most famous names, and credited with the earliest recording of the sights to be seen.\n\nOver time, as people became more distanced from the creation of these structures, they were viewed with more incredulity, or wonder. Clayton and Price write that the common usage in the Greek shifted from *theamata*(sights) to *thaumata*(wonder), and it was set. Concurrently, the passage of time provided more perspective on the wonders themselves, and the list was narrowed down by various people. Many people had differing lists through time though. Some wonders weren't included, while others were. Gregory of Tour had a list that had a heavily Christian influence for example. \n\nClayotn and Price argue that the list which we today call the Seven came about during the Renaissance. I've only ever heard of minor differences in the ancient lists and the modern one, chief being the Lighthouse of Alexandria not appearing in ancient lists. The Renaissance list was fixed at a time when '[scholars] could discern with a dispassionate eye the monuments that had really made the greatest impact' upon the world. \n\nThese became our list today:\n\n\n* The Great Pyramid of Giza\n* The Lighthouse Pharos at Alexandria\n* The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus\n* The Temple to Artemis at Ephesus\n* The Statue of Zeus at Olympia\n* The Colossus Helios of Rhodes\n* The Hanging Gardens of Babylon\n\n[Maerten van Heemskerck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maarten_van_Heemskerck) illustrated the Wonders in engravings(so maybe illustrate is a bad word?), and this seems to have settled the list as it collected them all visually. However, this was drawn upon from ancient sources that he and other scholars had access to, and is therefore a list that could be missing some fantastic structures. \n\nSo to sum up, and answer your original questions in a tl;dr before this laptop dies.\n**Where does the \"Seven Wonders of the World\" title come from?** It comes from the Greek word for 'sights', and evolved into the word for 'wonder', which was similar in spelling(and presumably sound).\n\n**Who coined the term, and when?** The historian Herodotus provided one of the first lists around the time of the Wonders co-existence, and later, it became a collective name that was more fixed by Renaissance artists and scholars.\n\n**Were they always the same wonders?** No, different historians had different suggestions. Time narrowed the vision to these seven.\n\nSources: *The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World*, ed. Peter Clayton and Martin Price, 1988.

                "answer": "<p>What you're looking at in Mad Men is a mixture of built-in obsolescence and conspicuous consumption. More on that in a moment.\n\nThe first passenger elevator was invented by Elisha Otis, whose name may ring a bell for being the founder and namesake of the ubiquitous Otis Elevator Company. Otis' device was unique in that it was marketed as a *safety* elevator that employed a system of gears (sorry if I've abused the technical term here, I'm hopeless at math, robotics and all sorts of black magic you engineers use) that interlocked with \"teeth\" in order to prevent a freefall in case the cable holding the elevator car snapped. Modern elevators use a similar albeit more sophisticated system, but it's easiest to see in [this 19th century diagram](http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2014/01/elevator-inventor-testing-elevator.jpg) from one of Otis' own exhibitions.\n\nWhile elevator accidents were rare, the psychological impact of Otis' elevator was nothing short of extraordinary. Most Americans (and, indeed, Europeans) alive in 1850 lived in townhouses and low-rise apartment buildings rarely exceeding five to six stories in height. These buildings required all of the occupants to use stairs in order to get from the ground floor to their rooms above in a settlement pattern dating back to Roman *insulae*. With an elevator, however, buildings could be built even higher in a fashion that guaranteed the safety of their occupants. This might seem like a no-brainer, but cognitively accepting that a building could be built three or four times as tall as the largest building you've ever seen was a significant hurdle in urban development: the equivalent impact to modern eyes would be seeing a space elevator or some sort of massive construction project today. Victorian Americans continued to live in low-rise housing, but Otis' safety elevators soon found widespread use in commercial buildings on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nMost Americans of means would have first encountered elevators in hotels or office buildings, where they began to be built en masse in the period following the Civil War. Residential elevators began to see credence in large mid-rise buildings approximately two decades later, by which time they were considered an acceptably safe form of transit. The first major apartment house in New York to use an elevator was the Dakota whose developer, Edward Cabot Clark, directed Henry Hardenburgh to go-all out with a then-unheard of six elevators for residential use. Early passenger elevators required operators to use a type of [lever that would control the speed of the elevator](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4108/5010333971_1824a59b0e_z.jpg) in order to ascend or descend. This required some skill. Elevator operators would adjust the speed of the lever to match the grade of the car with the grade of the floor so that occupants could board and depart on an even surface, a task that took the Otis Elevator several decades to fix. In 1924, Otis began to tinker with a semi-automatic signal system that would fix the problem of creating a level surface between slab and cab, but the first semi-automatic elevator wouldn't appear until 1937 and the first fully-automatic elevator until 1950. While major office buildings were quick to adopt them in a competitive market that sought to attract tenants, residential buildings were significantly slower to replace their existing mechanisms due to the expense involved.\n\nThere is also the matter of a personal touch. Many elevator operators continued to function as ushers of sorts, directing occupants to certain office suites or apartments, sometimes dropping off mail and packages to residents of especially nice apartment buildings or even subbing as porters. This therefore meant that the elevator operator evolved into a sort of price-effective building amenity -- it was cheaper to keep on two elevator operators at an average annual salary of $3,120 (1950) than to replace their existing elevators with expensive new technology. It also allowed the building management to pick and choose staff at certain times of day, allowing operators to function as a sort of generic employee as time moved on. Elevator operators continue to exist today, although they mostly exist as a sign of conspicuous consumption due to the high cost of labor.\n\nedit: grammar, repeating words/phrases, cleaned up sentence structure. wrote this at 2am.\n\nedit 2: This is a shameless plug, but if you thought elevators could be interesting, [I'd love to direct you to this post I wrote about the history of Afghanistan](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/4u7y2e/kabul_afghanistan_1972/d5ou9q7?context=3).

                "answer": "<p>This is a pretty interesting topic, so I did a little reading on it. And it's true, many visual Greek depictions feature small penises. But they also feature large ones too (McNiven 10). Context is relevant: in an erotic context, penises are obviously erect and generally larger, so the Greek artistic depictions leave the possibility that Greek men had tastefully moderate sized penis in public, but were still gloriously masculine in private (10). The Greeks were greatly concerned with the difference between public and private conduct, and Greek men may very well have been quite prudish (Garland 112). The ideal Greek penis apparently was  \"small, thin, and had a pointed foreskin\",* which the Greeks believed was best for reproductive purposes since its semen, travelling a shorter distance, would lose less heat (McLaren 3-4). However, the symbol of the erect penis represented masculinity and power, and was depicted often in public spaces (4). The Greeks were very concerned with moderation in sex, and this actually extended to their views on penis size, where too big a penis was not moderate and was therefore morally \"bad\", hence the depiction of the large penis on Satyrs and the like (McNiven 14). Due to the relationship between moderation and penis size in art, large penises were associated with *hubris*, a criminal sort of violence, and drunkenness (McNiven 14). So from what I've read, it might be not so much that all Greeks had small penises as that they viewed a flaccid, non-aggressive penis as a more appropriate public ideal, moderate and \"civilised\".\n\nAs for women, we don't really know what they thought (unfortunately their 'voice' has not come through much in the literary sources), but we do know that an extreme emphasis was placed upon virginity and fidelity in citizen women, so they were unlikely to sleep around, with rare exceptions, such as with Alcibiades (Garland 112). The other women that Greek men, married or not, would sleep with (slaves and prostitutes), weren't really free to pick their sexual partners anyway. A man who \"sought to please\" or was a passive partner, even with a female, was considered effeminate (McLaren 5). However, the Greeks also thought that younger women might be too much for older men, due to the former being sexually demanding: Plutarch even claimed that under Athenian law, a woman could demand her husband have sex with her at least three times a month (McLaren 7). The Greeks viewed sex (especially semen) as important for health, so it was not that important that women enjoyed sex (8). Men were taught to use sex as a method of control and establishing dominance rather than pleasure (23). It's unlikely that women got a lot of pleasure from many of their sexual encounters, but they also probably didn't expect to. They must have also believed sex to be important for their health, and valued their role, critical to the state, as child-bearers and mothers. Perhaps the work of Sappho can elaborate on female views on the matter, but I haven't read her.\n\nSo the Greek ideal of a small, flaccid penis was a theoretical, moral convention. I'm not sure it necessarily reflected their actual, average penis size in the bedchamber: aside from the obvious, a flaccid and an erect penis were considered to be very different things. Greek men did not take their pride in sexual performance from any ability to please their partner, but merely as a reaffirmation of their superior status as citizen men. Greek citizen women would almost universally never have slept with anybody but their citizen husband, and women were deliberately kept away from the sight of naked male athletes (Garland 112) so they probably wouldn't have many 'penis snapshots' to compare their husband to. As members of their society, shaped by its *mores*, Greek women probably had the same views on penis size as Greek men, so aside from the fact they would probably be horrified by seeing any naked penis aside from their husband's, they would not necessarily have been excited by the thought of a bigger penis. Additionally, even if we assume that a larger penis is better for a woman's pleasure (I like to think that's not true.........), women were not supposed to 'enjoy' sex too much (though the trope was that they wanted it anyway, so I dunno). As such, maybe it wouldn't have mattered to women anyway. A woman might have a different perspective but, alas, I am not one of those.\n\n\n*As an aside, the Greeks (and Romans) also seem to have valued large foreskins (Hodges 405). Greek nurses apparently used swaddling to shape the scrotum and elongate the foreskin (McLaren 3).\n\nSources:\n\nGarland, Daily Life of the Ancient Greeks, 1998.\n\nHodges, The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme, 2001.\n\nMcLaren, Impotence: A Cultural History, 2007.\n\nMcNiven, The Unheroic Penis: Otherness Exposed, 1995.\n\n\n</p>",

I don't think there's much that explicitly says that smaller ones were desirable exactly, although for sure the great Greek heroes and soldiers are depicted as pretty minimally endowed.\n\nAs for what women thought - who knows? The views of the average woman on stuff like this are pretty much invisible now, since their writings (if there were many) are unknown to us and we don't know of female artists either really.\n\nCertainly Greek men attributed to same views to women in literature - Aristophanes's comic play Lysistrata is probably the classic example of how men wanted to perceive women's views about sex.

                "answer": "<p>This is a very interesting question which sadly does not have the comfort of a single neat answer. The first thing which is **essential** when thinking about 1700-1800 Crime and Punishment in Britain is to get rid of any preconceived notions of the state and justice systems. Once you have done that and seen the system as a far more patchwork, contradictory and individualised morass you will be on the right track!\n\nSo first \u2013 did the transportation happen to deal with over-crowded jails? Unfortunately not directly. The 1718 act which kick started all of this (though single digits were transported before this) did not come in response to jails. First \u2018jails\u2019 as we know them today did not really exist. The standard of sending people to prison as a punishment in and of itself only really came about in the 1800\u2019s after a lot of navel-gazing due to the American Revolutionary War. Most were used for holding certain criminals pre-trial and debtors. Indeed Beattie\u2019s masterful study of Surrey 1722-1749  found that the most common crimes for which transportation was used post-1718 (non-capital property offenses) were almost never sentenced to prison before transportation was an option \u2013 60% were branded on the thumb and let go! \n\nThere is a branch of historiography which argues that the need for population in the empire \u2013 as well as what amounts to indentured servitude to provide labour for infrastructure projects in the nascent empire underlined transportation. The logic broadly goes that under this the masses of working poor found themselves being transported with the nature of the crime being an after thought. This is used to explain the pattern of crimes we shall see in a second, but does not necessarily hold much water \u2013 though it is important to know that it was almost certainly a happy by-product. Indeed transported labour also found themselves not only in America pre-revolutionary war (around 50,000 or so) and Australia post-revolutionary war (roughly 160,000 or so) but across the empire (in much smaller numbers) in Bermuda, Gibraltar, Mauritius, Bencoolen, Penang, Malacca and Singapore, and the Burmese provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim.\n\nSo who was sent and why? There is no simple answer. While laws were passed down from Parliament Britain throughout this period did not have a systematic bureaucracy of justice to reliable and consistently deliver these laws. Instead the dominant force of law was the JP (Justice of the Peace). He was usually a local notable with economic and often social links to community. His role was not simply as presiding judge but almost as a jack-of-all-trades executive-part-time-functionary of the state. He administered the proto-welfare, the prisons, trials, highways in some cases etc. Much has been made of their paternalist self-conception and self-ascribed desire to ensure the health and peace of their community for either self motivated or high minded (or both) reasons. Any local Gaol was paid for locally. As it happens this often meant it was paid for by the same men who were JPs as they made up a large part of the tax base. These JPs therefore had an economic incentive not to send people to jails and utilise any option of further punishment. With the opening up of transportation as a viable option we see a flooding of cases all the way through. It is very interesting that the decline of transportation and beginning of prisons (which are intimately but not directly-linked)  happened in the mid 1800\u2019s as central government took over more of the economic and bureaucratic functions of justice.\n\nSo who found themselves being transported? There are lots of interesting lists of punishment which are good to get a feel. As always comparison is the mother of nuance and it may be worth looking at the similarities and differences between [Wales](https://www.llgc.org.uk/php_ffeiliau/sf_results.php?co=All&from=1760&off_cat=3&off_co=All&to=1830&off=550) and [The Old Bailey in London](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?form=searchHomePage&_divs_fulltext=transportation&kwparse=and&_persNames_surname=&_persNames_given=&_persNames_alias=&_offences_offenceCategory_offenceSubcategory=&_verdicts_verdictCategory_verdictSubcategory=&_punishments_punishmentCategory_punishmentSubcategory=&_divs_div0Type_div1Type=&fromMonth=&fromYear=1776&toMonth=&toYear=1840&ref=&submit.x=39&submit.y=16&submit=Search) but the story is a confusing one. A lot of research has gone into exactly who was sent and why and there are two not-necessarily mutually-exclusive answers:\nFirstly: It was largely arbitrary depending on the whim, policies and nature of the sentencing JP and his area and local concerns. This can be seen in the above documents, for the sprawling with criminal-element-urban-poor London between 1766-1776 2/3 of sentences included transportation \u2013 a seeming symptom of the increasing fears of an ever-growing criminal underclass in the city. While in more rural and distant Wales whipping and other traditional measures remained comparatively common. A disproportionate 18,600 prisoners out of the 50,000 overall transported by 1775 (i.e. to American) came from London. (It is important to concede even in London the old practices continued: the number of whippings carried out by the Sheriff of London rose from forty in 1779 to 164 in 1785). Interestingly the lack of consistency is even more granular - the magistrates of the City of London (different the London and Middlesex JP's) were unduly *lenient* in their application towards petty vagrancy. Where other places (often rural areas suspicious of outsiders arguably with JPs with a clearer sense of community to which to attach their paternalist instincts) transported vagrants with reckless abandon the City of London had an almost solid refusal to transport vagrants abroad. Rather than transport them they initially sent them to hospitals and houses of correction, for example Hitchcock points out: *\u201cIn November 1784, the keeper of Newgate recorded 529 inmates, comprising 362 felons and 167 debtors, \u2026 A year later the keeper recorded 680 prisoners. By October 1788 this figure had reached almost 750\"*, much of this increase was due to the vagrancy crisis of the 1780\u2019s. Furthermore later on they did have their own form of transportation - to the neighbouring counties (around 1,200 a year) or Ireland whom the presiding authority in the mid 1780's, Henry Adams estimated that 45% of all vagrants were repatriated to.  So on one-hand your chances of being sent were incredibly dependent on your JP and your crime with very little in the way of consistent application due to the hodge-podge nature of provincial administration in Britain at the time.\n\nSecondly however there is a broad pattern. An analysis, which you can see in the court records for yourself, find that the vast majority of those sent fall into two camps. The first camp is low-level non-captial (i.e. not serious) property offenses associated with the low-level criminal underclass. There have been some examples above \u2013 however even a casual read gives examples of people sent for theft of low value items, low level fraud etc. Rushton and Morton found that prior to the American Revolutionary War of 4500 offenders most were sent due to these petty offenses. Griffith further pointed out that children were over-represented in these transportations \u2013 whose criminal profile easily conforms to this view.  An interesting study of one fleet found that 6/10 were vagrants but there were also *\u201c100 thieves, forty-one people caught walking after curfew, twenty-six nightwalkers, twenty-one badly behaved servants, forty-five beggars, five cheats, one drunk, and a single ballad-singer\u201d* \u2013 showing the diverse range of those sent.\n\nThe second camp who found themselves transported were those whose (more serious) crimes technically found themselves under the much famed \u201cBloody Code\u201d (the massive increase in death penalty offenses in the period) despite (to our eyes) their relatively low level character. It seems that the JPs in many cases opted for transportation for more serious offenses which were *legally* but not *morally* capital in their eyes (though obviously this is ripe with variation) therefore transportation was an easy route - almost acting as a 'safety valve' to the excesses of the Bloody Code. Examples includes assaults, serious libels, some arsons and high-value thefts.\n\nOverall therefore it is difficult to delineate a set pattern of crime for which transportation was an option \u2013 such was the confused, regionally dependent and often arbitrary British justice system of the time. Generally though it was reserved for the low-level property crimes which for the perceived social good and proportionality transportation away from the community was desirable.\n\n**Edit** \nThank you /u/avapoet for the Gold - it is very kind!\n\n**Sources** \n\nHarling (2014). *The Trouble with Convicts: From Transportation to Penal Servitude, 1840\u2013 67* .

A 'crucifixion' is just a vague conglomeration of concepts around torture and hanging something up on something (*crux* is used by Pliny to denote hanging up some vines).\n\nThere's a number of words used to describe the processes of crucifixion (*crux, patibulum, furca, stipes, and arbor infelix*) but there's no standard definition of what they mean or how they were used.  You suspended the victim to a *crux* which is some sort of wooden device, and sometimes you attached them to a pole.  The *patibulum*  is simply just a pole or a beam, and *can* be some sort of crossbar but there's no particular way it has to be fixed. Being attached to a pole was a crucifixion, Crucifixions also involved rectal impaling, stabbing people through their genitals into the ground, and attaching people's genitals to tree branches, so it's a bit difficult to nail (ha!) one definition down without it getting up and wandering off ^1 to have chat with some other definitions.\n\nIn answer to /u/Bobarhino , quite a lot of executions were done like this, but nobody really describes the process of crucifixion enough to come to a final answer.

It's difficult to even comprehend let alone believe for those who didn't see it first hand and as history wears on it would be easy to say 'Oh no, that surely cannot be. It must be exaggerated, that many is not even possible.' Thankfully the Allies had the foresight to painstakingly document everything that they found, as they found it, rather than only going back to do so after the war was won.\n\nIn terms of just how such a thing is possible, it would be wrong to imagine the Nazis as gassing 100 people every hour of every day for years and years - in fact, much of their work was done through simple starvation, and working their captives to death. Many more would have been killed in mass exterminations on the Eastern Front, never having made it to a camp. \n\nThe most notorious of these was probably at Babi Yar, where over 30,000 Ukrainian Jews were killed over a period of just two or three days in mass shootings where people were machine-gunned, thrown into ravines and buried - in some cases still alive.\n\nThere's also the Rumbula Massacre, where 25,000 Latvian Jews were killed in only a couple of days. And then the killings in Budapest towards the end of the war, where the Germans and Hungarians had so many people to exterminate that, in order to save bullets, they would tie several Jews together, shoot one, and then throw the whole lot into the Danube so that the dead one dragged the others down and they drowned.\n\nAnd then there's *Aktion Erntefest*, which translates cheerfully to 'Operation: Harvest Festival' where *in a single day* over forty-thousand Jews were liquidated throughout the Nazi Concentration Camps located in Eastern Poland, in anticipation of a Russian offensive.\n\nThese are just a few of the massed killings of thousands of people, often carried out by small numbers of men with little more than automatic weapons in their hands and hatred in their hearts. With these mass killings you can easily begin to understand how the Nazis managed to average out to your 100 per hour figure.\n\nEdit: Wow, Reddit gold!

                "answer": "<p> When you are talking about the period of the English Longbowmen you are essentially talking about Henry V and his campaign in France culminating with the battle of Agincourt first and foremost, and I can tell you for Henry stocking enough arrows for his archers was a huge task requiring a national effort.\n\n England was bankrupt and haphazardly managed when Henry V took the throne, and he spent much of the first part of his reign reforming every part of the government. The greater part of this involved consolidating his recently reconquered Welsh holdings and doing a massive audit and restructuring of the Royal estates, both of which generated a tremendous amount of ready cash. He also started reforming his military on the supply and organization side. \n\n You are absolutely right that archers could run out of arrows in a few minutes of battle. An archer had to be able to fire ten arrows in a minute, and good archers could fire much quicker. Arrows were carried in sheaves of 24, archers carried 2 sheaves on them and a few spares, so a typical English Longbowman of Henry V's day could expend their entire combat load in between 4 and 8 minutes of steady firing. Realistically they probably would not fire at max rate for a stretch of 4-8 minutes very often, but still, they needed an ample supply to fight a battle lasting hours.\n\n The arrows themselves are difficult. They are made of multiple pieces which each have their own supply train and manufacturing difficulty. For long range arrows the arrow head is made of iron, but two compounds, a hard edge and a softer core to absorb shock on impact, a 30 inch shaft constructed of lighter wood which has to be basically perfectly straight or it's useless. The fletchings are made of goose feathers, and this requires the plucking of a lot of geese. Shorter range arrows are a little shorter, heavier, made of a thicker piece of hard wood like ash and have a head called a bodkin which is very narrow for penetrating armor at close range.\n\n Almost immediately on taking the throne Henry V appointed fletcher (a professional arrow maker) Nicholas Mynot Keeper of the King's Arrows and set him up in the Tower of London with a staff and healthy budget for building up stocks. This was a separate job from the King's Bowyer, responsible for making bows and with the right to commandeer any wood in the country for that purpose. The Keeper of the King's Arrows began production and farmed production out to other fletchers, making orders for arrows in the tens of thousands. \n\n The production of arrows required arrow heads made by smiths by the barrel, tens of thousands of shafts, and goose feathers literally in the millions (there is an order recorded for over 1.1 million goose feathers for the King's arrow making facilities, and that is one single order). Because of all this planning, effort, and expenditure of resources Henry V was exceptionally well equipped when he set off for France. I would caution you though that while Henry V is the obvious example for a question on the logistics of English Longbowmen he was an uncommonly capable administrator and not every monarch would have been so well prepared for a campaign.\n\n Robert Hardy's Longbow: A Social and Military History goes into a lot of detail on all things Longbow related, I find Juliet Barker's Agincourt very valuable for information on Henry V's campaign preparations.</p>",

The Romans formed a square formation, and instead of attacking the Roman army head on, the Parthians surrounded the Romans and began a continual hail of arrows from all sides.\n\n'But the Parthians now stood at long intervals from one another and began to shoot their arrows from all sides at once, not with any accurate aim (for the dense formation of the Romans would not suffer an archer to miss even if he wished it), but making vigorous and powerful shots from bows which were large and mighty and curved so as to discharge their missiles with great force. At once, then, the plight of the Romans was a grievous one; for if they kept their ranks, they were wounded in great numbers, and if they tried to come to close quarters with the enemy, they were just as far from effecting anything and suffered just as much. For the Parthians shot as they fled, and next to the Scythians, they do this most effectively; and it is a very clever thing to seek safety while still fighting, and to take away the shame of flight.' \n\nPlutarch, Life of Crassus 24.5-6\n\nCrassus counted on being able to hold the Roman formation intact with minimal casualties until the Parthians ran out of arrows, but his plan led to disaster as the Parthian general Surena had planned his supply chain with great foresight, and had numerous camels available to carry arrows to the archers.\n\n'Now as long as they had hopes that the enemy would exhaust their missiles and desist from battle or fight at close quarters, the Romans held out; but when they perceived that many camels laden with arrows were at hand, from which the Parthians who first encircled them took a fresh supply, then Crassus, seeing no end to this, began to lose heart, and sent messengers to his son with orders to force an engagement with the enemy before he was surrounded; for it was his wing especially which the enemy were attacking and surrounding with their cavalry, in the hope of getting in his rear.'\n\nPlutarch, Life of Crassus, 25.1\n\nSo in this case, the Parthians were ready to replenish the arrow supply for the front line via camel. While the Parthians were only resupplied once in Plutarch's account, it is likely that the camels could have returned to the supply train to collect more.</p>",

In short, one side found itself short of arrows, and by a long way: they needed something on the order of 100,000 arrows, in anticipation of the largest naval battle ever fought (by number of ships). So, choosing a foggy evening, one side loaded straw and straw figures onto numerous boats, tied to ropes. The other side, seeing the boats emerging from the mist, and thinking they were being attacked, naturally called for their archers, who shot tens of thousands of arrows at the 'attackers.' The arrows stuck in the straw, and the 'attackers (who eventually won the battle), retrieved the boats, and all those arrows.\n\nThe incident, and the entire Battle of Chibi, was dramatized in the movie Red Cliff.

He saw, not on Naboo, but on Coruscant the corruption, the greed, and the ineffectiveness of the Galactic Republic. It was not his heritage on Naboo that led him to come to the realization, but instead through his time dealing with the corrupt Trade Federation, and ultimately how greedy aliens could be when in power, with the formation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. \n\nTherefore, I disagree with the \"Cultural Analysis\" because it ignores the galactic influence on the Emperor and instead only focuses on one facet of the man. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>In the book *War and the Law of Nations* by Stephen Neff, he does go into the process of how the concept of a declaration of war developed.\n\nAccording to Neff and his sources, war as a state of being (that is, the idea that a country is \"at war\" or \"at peace\") really only developed from Hugo Grotius' work in the early 17th century.\n\nPrior to that, war was mostly defined by Cicero's definition of \"A contending by force\" rather than the more modern definition of \"the condition of those contending by force.\" This is important for the concept of a declaration of war. The medieval concept of war was essentially individual acts or campaigns disrupting the normal state of peace, but not a dichotomy of peace vs war *per se*, as we view it now.\n\nAll of this is background, but it is important to understanding the rest.\n\nA declaration of war itself primarily served to satisfy feudal notions of honor, as it relates to the just-war theory. In *Warfare in Medieval Brabant, 1356-1406* by Sergio Boffa he states that these declarations of war, especially around the 14th century, tended to take the form of letters of defiance - essentially a letter delivered by a herald to the opposing head of state.\n\nYou also had the concept of reprisals - declarations of war associated with a response to something a belligerent country has done. A key point is that for general reprisals - in which the country itself mobilized - honor required a declaration of war, but specific reprisals (against, say, a single count that keeps leading raids across a boarder, or something similar) would not, because in this second case the action would be considered simply a response to the original belligerent (the raid-leading count) by the injured party (the other count he was raiding).\n\nThe specific time frames I found all seem to draw from *Le droit de la guerre et les pr\u00e9curseurs de Grotius,* by Ernest Nys. The idea was, to satisfy notions of honor, roughly three days was given between the declaration (dispatching the herald) and the first attack. Unfortunately, other works dated around the time of Nys' publication seem to claim that this practice was *universal,* which is patently false - it was only ever codified within the Holy Roman Empire after Frederick I, and with one particular french king, after all. However, the general consensus seems to be that - where it applied - the 3 day wait period was not so much to allow the other head of state to address the grievance, but rather that it was not honorable to attack an unaware opponent.\n\nNow, given that pile of background information, this leads us to two possibilities:\n\n1. The country declaring war actually sends a declaration of war/letter of defiance to the other party.\n\n2. The country does not declare war, but simply mobilizes and attacks.\n\nIn situation one, the time it takes for the other kingdom/empire to know that you are at war happens to be as much time as it takes for a Herald to make it from one kingdom to another. Horse speed, though certainly not at full gallop. Other heralds within the first kingdom would issue a call to arms for vassals within the kingdom (per Nys again).\n\nIn situation two, kingdom 2 finds out that it is at war when word reaches them: they either get wind of kingdom 1's mobilization (that vassal call to arms) via information routes (not necessarily spies - this could simply be merchants moving through), or when first contact with the enemy is made. Declarations started to fall out of fashion by the 16th century - the Spanish Armada was sent against England without a formal declaration, for instance.\n\nTL;DR: Assuming they sent out a declaration, it would go out as fast as the herald could make it from King A to King B at horse speed, but not a full gallop - mobilization for war could begin before the actual declaration, and as long as an attack did not happen until after, honor was satisfied. If they did not send out a proper declaration, the court would find out it was at war as soon as a messenger arrived from whichever boarder county/duchy got hit first, or when they got wind of the other country mobilizing against them.\n\nEdit: I also want to state that if you are just looking for an idea of how ancient declarations of war were handled (rather than specifically medieval ones), Roman records were actually far more detailed on all of these subjects, and you can get a much more precise picture of what happened with declarations of war in Rome if you want from one of the Rome historians in this sub.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Great question. We can't talk about the 21st century because of the 20-year rule here, so let's talk about how **anti-intellectualism is woven into the makeup of the United States.** What you're seeing are shadows and ripples of a debate between republicanism and federalism that dates to the first days of the United States.\n\nI'm going to copy in bulk [an answer I previously wrote here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5lpzo7/what_are_the_roots_of_antiintellectualism_in_the/), because I think it's relevant to your question. I'll expand upon it and edit it for this discussion.\n\nThe classic answer can be found in Richard Hofstadter's 1963 book, *Anti-Intellectualism in American Life*. Hofstadter, who went on to win the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction for the book, wrote:\n\n>\"Anti-intellectualism . . . is founded in the democratic institutions and the egalitarian sentiments of this country.\"\n\nFor Hofstadter, who traces anti-intellectualism to broadsheets levied against some of the first American presidential candidates, the roots go to the classic American debate between who governs best. Is it the mob, the vast majority of Americans who have little interest or knowledge in a topic, or is it a smaller and traditionally less representative group of people who have more experience and education on a topic?\n\nKeep in mind that Hofstadter is writing at a time when the effects of the GI Bill and the democratization of higher education were well under way, something that directly hits upon your question.\n\nAs Woodrow Wilson [said in 1912](http://livefromthetrail.com/about-the-book/speeches/chapter-2/woodrow-wilson): \"What I fear is a government of experts. God forbid that in a democratic country we should resign the task and give the government over to experts. What are we for if we are to be scientifically taken care of by a small number of gentlemen who are the only men who understand the job?\"\n\nWilson was speaking specifically about Theodore Roosevelt's idea of \"good\" and \"bad\" trusts. He's arguing that asking government to distinguish is putting society in the hands of a few folks.\n\nHofstadter is still quoted frequently on this topic, but there are a lot of things he missed, as Nicholas Lemann points out [in a wonderful 50th anniversary retrospective review](http://www.cjr.org/second_read/richard_hofstadter_tea_party.php).\n\nHofstadter (and plenty of people today) think of anti-intellectualism as solely the domain of the political right. But Hofstadter missed people like Donald Kagan, Robert Bork, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Allan Bloom, who wrote *The Closing of the American Mind.* These are all right-wing intellectual thinkers who did a great deal to affect the public discourse. Bloom's book is noteworthy for discussing left-wing anti-intellectualism, which doesn't get a lot of attention.\n\nHofstadter also tended to describe business as anti-intellectual, when we know that today, business is one of the most intellectual-friendly branches of American society because of the switch to a service, \"knowledge\" economy. America today relies proportionally more on designers and inventors, innovators and trend-makers, rather than hands-on industrialists and manufacturers as it did in 1963, when Hofstadter was writing.\n\nHe also missed the rise of the Civil Rights movement for women and minorities in the United States.\n\nThat's getting a little off track, however. The bottom line is that there is (and has been) a constant push-pull between appeals to the \"mob\" and the \"elite\" in American society.\n\nIn *Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic,* Gordon Wood contends that the first 30 years of the United States resulted in a switch from the desires of the nation's founders \u2500 who were the elite of the nation \u2500 to the will of the middling people, those involved in commerce and enterprise.\n\nThe founders of the United States had envisioned a Congress and President who were already wealthy and thus immune from corruption. The thought went that they would be self-sacrificing and put aside their businesses to serve the national good for a period, then return to their own interests afterward. \n\nJoyce Appleby and Wood contend that the middle classes, who enriched themselves through industry and enterprise, developed a belief that the self-made man was the ideal politician, not someone who had been born wealthy, was educated, and thus theoretically could be trusted to make a decision without being swayed by public opinion.\n\nAnd so we have a push and pull, dating back to the roots of the United States.\n\nHofstadter also makes the case that evangelical Protestantism in the United States, particularly in the South, strongly contributed to anti-intellectualism in the latter half of the 19th century and the 20th century. Mark Noll's *The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind* is a more in-depth analysis of this aspect.\n\nNoll has done some excellent work on American religious history (I highly recommend his *The Civil War as a Theological Crisis*) and he explains that a lot of the American evangelical anti-intellectualism can be traced back to the development of a \"literalist\" interpretation of the Bible as a response to the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century. Before the 19th century, and particularly before the French Revolution, churches and religious organizations tended to be pro-science if they were anything. \n\nIn the United States, this began to change as the arguments about slavery intensified. As Noll points out, the Civil War caused many churches to fission into southern and northern branches, based upon their beliefs in slavery. Northern churches tended to favor an interpretation-based view of the Bible, while Southern churches stuck with a much more literal interpretation of the Bible. Forex, since the Bible refers to slavery and the proper treatment of slaves, it must be appropriate to have slavery in the United States, they argued.\n\nThis literalist philosophy was later applied to things as varied as racial segregation, abortion, and global warming. Because of its reliance upon scripture as the absolute (literally Gospel) truth, anything that took a different viewpoint was seen in a dim light.\n\nBut let's come back to the beginning. The anti-intellectualism you see today isn't anything new. It's the classic argument in the United States: Should America favor a democratic outlook, one that values all opinions \u2500 even the uninformed and ignorant? Or should it favor an elitist outlook, one that puts a higher value on the informed and capable \u2500 even if that means disenfranchising or under-enfranchising people who might be affected by government policy?</p>",

While it again doesn't go into minutia, hopefully it should give a broad overview of the process until someone is able to fill in the details.\n\n>The process was aptly called \"Denazification\", and largely was centered around propaganda. The process began with the numerous war crime trials, which were publicized widely. Some of the members of the Hitler Youth were also accused of war crimes, but these accusations were really never pursued, as no one in the Hitler Youth was above the age of 18 at the time of their alleged crimes. Really in post war Germany, it seems that most of the Hitler Youth was not held responsible for crimes at all, and in the evaluation of Nazi members that followed the war, were essentially all exonerated. (I hesitate to say that none of them were held responsible for their actions, as I'm sure there were a couple select exceptions that I was simply unable to find) The Allies also implemented a strict censor on all German newspapers and radios, in a way that quite frankly was almost the same process that the Nazi's used throughout their reign. All forms of written, visual, and audio news were all controlled by the occupying government. 30,000 Nazi books were banned, including Mein Kampf (Which only just came back on to the German market this year) and possession of any banned books was a punishable offense. Mein Kampf being banned actually didn't do much to reduce Nazi sentiments, as the book was written for people who already agree with the ideas, however it did create an idea of taboo about the topic. At the same time, the Americans also worked to reconstruct Germany with the Marshall Plan, attempting to create an idea that they weren't conquerors, but rather liberators. This was somewhat furthered by the massive amounts of publications about the Holocaust, giving the Allies essentially the ultimate trump card in claiming they were in the right, and the Nazi's in the wrong. Incredible amounts of books, newspaper articles, and films such as \"Die Todesmuhlen\" (Meaning \"The Death-Mills\", it was a film on the holocaust that was released in Western Germany) were published and distributed throughout Germany about the events, and essentially placed the guilt of it on the German people. It seems this was placed just as much on the youth as it was the rest of the population, despite their amnesty when it came to the war crime trials. It's worth mentioning a lot of the propaganda strategies used were almost identical to Nazi propaganda, as it's effectiveness was incredible within the German people from 1933 to 1945. (For a great example of Nazi propaganda's influence, the chapter \"I Believe in Him\" in the book Language of the Third Reich by Victor Klemperer gives a better perspective on the German people's completely illogical faith in Hitler towards the end of the war) However as for the effectiveness of the Allies application of the propaganda, I've found conflicting evidence, so I can't speak to it. In the end however, the most effective Nazi nullifying aspect was the crippling depression and destruction of Germany itself after the war. The Nazi leaders were all dead, and unlike WWI where it could be argued Germany still had some fight left, the Germans had unquestionably been beaten. The things that had brought people to the Nazis, such as jobs and community provided, were gone and the ideas banned. The Hitler youth had been led largely by older members of the party, so it immediately ceased to be an influence at the war's end.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>**Part I**\n\nOne of the problems with analyzing the \u201c*HJ/Flakhelfer-Generation*\u201d and their postwar outcomes is that the numbers of German youth involved in either the *Hitler Jugend* (HJ) or Bund deutscher M\u00e4del (BDM) was quite vast. In 1939, for example, of the 8.87 million Germans aged 10-18, some 8.7 million were enrolled in both the HJ and BDM. The numbers grow even larger with older cohorts who were born before 1929 and spent some of their formative teen years in the 1930s in NSDAP youth organizations. Nor was the HJ/BDM experience universal; the patriarchal state lavished more resources on the HJ as opposed to its female counterpart, but even within the HJ, experiences with the organization could vary. The war adds a further complication as the older 1920s cohort experienced the brunt of the fighting while those on the younger generation came of age during the years of defeat. These generational experiences and the sheer scale of the sample make it very hard to estimate the precise nature of the HJ-Generations during the postwar period. \n\nSuch problems were not lost on the Allied military governments that occupied Germany during the postwar period. National Socialism prided itself on being a \u201cyoung\u201d movement and although its youth leaders seldom received much in the way of genuine power, this was an impression that stuck in the minds of many of the Allied administrators when they grappled with the idea of how to reform Germany. Films like Disney\u2019s luridly-titled [*Education for Death*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l14WDZCnz-w) were not just propaganda, but did reflect a certain panic about the discipline and regimentation of youth under fascism. One of the minor subthemes in American wartime discourses on the Nazi mind and society was that the excessive militarization and regimentation of organizations like the HJ had created a generation of technocratic automatons. In his preface of the 1938 English translation of the HJ\u2019s primer,  Harwood L. Childs  noted that this National Socialist youth programs were part of a coherent  strategy to mobilize German youth and inculcate a sense of national superiority. The former American ambassador to Germany William A. Dodd wrote in an afterward to Childs\u2019s translation that the idea behind Hitler\u2019s youth policy was to prepare\n\n>the way for a Nazified world where all freedom of the individual, of education, and modern freedom is to be suppressed. Is modern civilization to be converted into such a system? \n\nNor were such thoughts limited to Americans, a number of exiled Germans feared that they were in the process of losing German youth because of the influence of ideological socialization. SOPADE reports in the 1930s often noted that while some HJ members complained about ideological indoctrination, there was little in the way of a youth resistance in Germany. Writing in the 28 January 1945 *NYT*, the \u00e9migr\u00e9 sociologist Leopold Schwarzschild averred that:\n\n> all we have learned during this war seems to confirm our surmise that this generation actually has been deformed as thoroughly as could be expected under the circumstances. Hundreds of thousands of German war prisoners are now held in American and British camps. All observers agree that skepticism or hostility towards Nazism is now and then only amongst the oldest age groups. Among the younger ones, the products of the Hitler era, such symptoms are as good as absent.\n\nThe Soviet military government (SVAG) likewise identified HJ members as the likely culprits behind so-called werewolf groups and instructed its political police, the section K-5, to be on the look-out for evidence of HJ involvement in resistance. \n\nAlthough the four Allied occupation governments had different polices for youth, there were three broad axes for the denazification of the HJ-Generation. The first leg of the Allied approach was the complete disestablishment of Nazi youth organizations and an immediate form of reeducation for captured HJ-members who fought on the front lines. Eisenhower had actually signed an executive order in 28 September 1944 nullifying compulsory service in the HJ and this policy continued in the US military government (OMGUS). The second leg of denazification was to be a reform of the school system and rooting out Nazified faculty who would continue to spread Nazi ideals. The final element of youth denazification was the sponsorship of alternative organizations and youth activities that would educate German youth to rejoin the global community. It was in these last two axes that the denazification of German youth went on slightly different trajectories after German division. \n\nThe destruction of the HJ and BDM as an organization was one of the immediate tasks for the occupation governments. The Allied Control Council (ACC) decreed that both the HJ and BDM, along with other NSDAP organizations were now formally disestablished by virtue of Allied victory. Although the formal denazification process varied in all four zones, the ACC decided to adapt a more flexible approach to youth both on account of pressure from their German collaborators and because the denazification courts were already overburdened and understaffed. All the military governments instituted some form of a *de facto* amnesty for those born after 1929 that exempted the bulk of German youth from having to appear before the *Spruchkammer* (denazification tribunals). Exemptions to this amnesty included those in the HJ or BDM who had achieved a certain rank, had used these youth organizations to gain rank in the NSDAP or SS, or were paid volunteers of the organizations. The lack of homogeneity for these amnesty exemptions created a degree of chaos for the *Spruchkammer*, but most of the youth applicants for denazification received their \u201c*Persilschein*\u201d both on account of their youth and the overall leniency of the *Spruchkammer* process. \n\nWhile the disestablishment and dissolution of Nazi youth organizations was relatively easy, reestablishing a functional German school system was much harder. The bombing campaign and occupation of Germany had destroyed a good deal of infrastructure and the hungry years of 1945-47 also meant many surviving schools were bereft of basic supplies like lighting or heat. One of the constant motifs from memoirs in this period and backed up by various contemporary accounts was the lack of windows and firewood made school lessons quite distressing. The emerging Cold War as well as fears they might lose Germany if they did not reopen schools immediately also forced Allied military governments towards expedient solution. Thus denazification of faculty and textbooks sometimes took a backseat to having the schools function. Older class materials remained and they became a source of embarrassment to the occupation governments when they were brought to light. For instance, there were some schools in the AMZONE that had racist biology texts or arithmetic word problems using antisemitic language. \n\nThis created a case where teachers from the Third Reich found themselves back into positions of power. This trend was more pronounced in the Western zones where it was not atypical for a school to be reopened and then suddenly shut because of reports of Nazi-attitudes or a discovery that certain faculty had lied about their involvement with the Third Reich. In contrast, both SVAG and the SED placed a much greater emphasis upon promoting up a new generation of teachers, the *Neulehrer* program, who were born in the 1920s and early 1930s and were thus not tainted by deep involvement with Nazism. However, the *Neulehrer* program did have significant drawbacks as the pedagogical training of these new teachers was limited and instruction was often excessively ideological in nature. The newly minted teachers often stressed antifascism over the poorly-defined rubrics for education SVAG put out. Higher education in the Soviet zone also had a soft-denazification as expertise trumped the need for the elimination of Nazism. One of the many postwar disappointments of the German Jew Viktor Klemperer was that he noticed that some of the individuals that had either hounded him out of academia in the 1930s or looked the other way while the Jewish faculty were purged remained at their posts.\n\nOne of the persistent themes in both the Occupation press and various directives issued by the occupation governments was over the idleness and hooliganism of German youth. For all the fears and paranoia about the HJ and BDM\u2019s militarization of German youth, there was a strong undercurrent of admiration of the Third Reich\u2019s ability to give youth both structure and a purpose among a number of Allied commentators. David Smart of Coronet Films got his idea for short pedagogical films that would become ubiquitous in 1950s American classrooms from a trip he took in Germany in the 1930s. OMGUS surveys of the AMZONE Germans usually had HJ and BDM control over youth commonly listed as one of the few positive achievements of the Third Reich, and this was a sentiment that likely was shared in the rest of Germany. The war\u2019s disruption of family life, either through the loss of one or both parents, also made some type of order and outlet for German youth the be desirable. Therefore it became contingent for each occupation to sponsor its own youth movement. \n</p>",

It was celebrated on either Twelfth Night (January 5) or Christmas Eve, and revolved around a warm drink served in a large wooden bowl. The original celebration involved blessing the apple trees in hope of a good apple harvest in the coming year. \n\nThe drink itself has dozens of variations. They are mostly based on wine or mead, and contain various spices and roasted apple pulp, called lambswool. Many modern variations resemble mulled cider, and usually contain alcohol, but not always. \n\nThe celebration would have involved going door to door and sharing your wassail with neighbors, although there are also accounts of people going door to door asking to be served. \n\nSource: Conrad Jay Bladey has a book called \"Do the Wassail\" which is a pretty exhaustive history of the drink and the celebration.

                "answer": "<p>It may not be in the exact period of what you're asking but I thought you might enjoy to know a little about an old Scandinavian tradition known as The Yule Goat. \n\nIn Sweden(and in other parts of Scandinavia) it was a tradition which can be traced back to the pre-christian era and a popular theory is that it was connected to worship of the Pagan god Thor who rode a chariot drawn by two goats, but it is disputed and other say it may be related to Blot or just slaughter of a goat for a winter feast. \n\nIts role has changed a lot over the years ranging from part of a house-visiting wassailing group and as the item of a holiday prank were you sneaked in a goat made of straw or wood in to a neighbors house(or similar) and the only way for them to get rid of it was to sneak it back in to the first household in the same fashion. \n\nIn the 19th century it was slowly transformed into a character much like the Santa Claus we have to day. A man of the family would dress up as the Yule Goat and visit the family to hand out gifts. But the wassailing tradition was known to be performed well into the 20th century. However in the mid to late 19th century the Yule Goat was replaced by Jultomten(translated, The Yule Tomte), most likely as a result of the picturing of Saint Nicholas in England and continental Europe whom in the eyes of Swedes and Scandinavians looked somewhat like the Scandinavian mythical creature tomte or nisse with his white beard. \n\nToday the Jultomte is more or less identical in appearance with modern Santa Claus/Father Christmas but is still most oftenly a dressed up member of the family and still comes and visits the children in person to hand out his gifts. We also celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve(Swe. Julafton) and not Christmas Day(Swe. Juldagen).\n\nBut The Yule Goat is still a part of Christmas around here in the form of a [traditional Christmas Tree ornament](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Yule_Goat_on_the_christmas_tree_2.JPG) or decoration, most notably the giant [G\u00e4vle Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle_goat) which has the odd tradition of being the victim of arson every year[(Tom Scott has an excellent video about it on his YouTube channel)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zjJpFYtx9s)\n\nMerry Christmas!

                "answer": "<p>In Newfoundland due to our English and Irish influences there are many customs that came over and have since died out, these customs range from more normal like the Yule log to the more obscure. The main focus of these customs would involve going from house to house, this would be the case when mummering or going janneying. This tradition exists in Philadelphia as well, but I'm not sure if it's exactly the same. Anyway to go Mummering you need to get rigged up in disguises, go from house to house playing music and drinking, the mummers would only leave if you could guess who they were. In order to disguise yourself you would try to change the way you walked, the way you looked (by stuffing pillows or other things in your clothes), cross dress, covering your face with cloth, and when you speak you would inhale. Most communities in NFLD were quite small so you could usually figure out who the people were. However, in the larger communities having bands of masked people wandering around lead not only to mischief but to more sinister acts such as murder. \nMummering was outlawed in the late 1800's but continued in the \"outport\" communities where there was no police presence. Currently there is a mummers parade that happens in the capital of St. John's every year so the custom is being revived. \n\nAnother custom on St. Stephen's Day is \"The Wren\". Coming from England and Ireland this custom would involve young boys killing a wren and going from door to door asking people for money to bury the dead bird. In NFLD unfortunately there were no wrens so kids would make an effigy of the bird and going door to door reciting a poem to ask for money...\n\n\"The wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds.\nSt. Stephen\u2019s Day he was caught in the furze.\nAlthough he was little,\nHis honour was great.\nRise up kind lady and give us a treat.\nUp with the kettle,\nAnd down with the pan.\nGive us a penny to bury the wren.\nA pocketful of money,\nAnd a cellar full of cheer.\nAnd we wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\"\n\u2014as recited by Dennis Flynn</p>",

                "answer": "<p>OK SO I'm going to share my research process on this at the end because I found it quite funny. \n\nThe answer to this is yes, conditional upon the musical tastes of the troops obviously. I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2r6cuv/were_songs_that_we_currently_associate_with_the/cncwsl0) which /u/ForExes kindly dug up(and called excellent! I'm blushing!) awhile ago and I think that answers the popularity aspect of this music. I would also encourage you to read all the comments replying to mine in that answer because the users tidied up a few of my scattered thoughts and incorrect points.\n\nThe second part of your question is what I'll address here. Again, the answer is yes, and not just allowed, but encouraged. \n\nDave Billingsly, an American medic who arrived in Vietnam in 1970 recounts his first day in Vietnam:\n\n>I saw this little club there called Alice\u2019s Restaurant,\u201d Billingsly reported. \u201cThen, a helicopter flew over and it had a peace sign painted on it. It also had a speaker hanging out of it, and they were playing \u2018Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u2019 So, I went into Alice\u2019s Restaurant and everywhere I looked there were dudes with peace signs around their necks, beads, headbands. And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018Where the fuck am I?\u2019\n\nThis account shows that among the troops, longing for peace was a common sentiment(unless he walked into the pacifist hotbed of the American Army on day 1). This means that many of the protest songs, like Fortunate Son, would resonate with an army of men who didn't particularly want to be there. More directly to your second question, it shows that music was played from the helicopters.\n\nA similar account says: \n\n>We\u2019re flying at seven or eight thousand feet listening to AFVN radio\u2014\u2018From the Delta to the DMZ\u2019\u2014 and \u2018Like a Rolling Stone\u2019 comes on. The rim shot and the explosion of the music. I could remember it from 1965 when we used to just turn it up and stop everything to listen to it, but flying over Vietnam, in the cockpit of an airplane, being totally stoned, out of bullet range, looking down at the war, and listening to the music, nothing like it.\n\nAgain, music is a common theme here(along with pot). I guess the new question is why was music allowed on the choppers? Surely this would be distracting or something? The answer actually links back to your first question about popularity.\n\nIn the dying years of the war, American troop numbers were being scaled back in preparation for an exit. This led to more men resisting fighting(disobeying orders, fragging officers etc.) and in general, there was the idea that control of the troops might have been lost. The American response to this was to raise morale with material things. Classic capitalists. \n\nMeredith Lair in her book *Armed with Abundance: Consumerism and Soldiering in the Vietnam War* writes that the military hierarchy made sure that music was available to the troops at all times. By 1969 she says, a third of troops listened to music for 5 hours a day. About a third of your waking time in a standard 8-16 hour sleep schedule, but I assume soldiers would have less sleep time. 99% of personnel had a radio by 1970, and the American Forces Vietnam Network(who I think is [GOOOOD MOOOOOOOOOORNING VIETNAAAAAAAAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwSra5p8MDw)?) were broadcasting 24/7. \n\nSo, music was seen as a key weapon in the war against declining troop morale, to the point where the military even organised Woodstock tribute concerts for the troops, and encouraged them to listen to music. I don't know how loud you'd have to play a song to hear it over the rotors, but by the two accounts above, that's what they did.\n\nEDIT: My research process! My first move was to Google \"did vietnam helicopters play music\" because that seemed like it might lead to some obscure article.. Instead it led me to this absolute gold mine of [Yahoo Answers](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101126100542AAy8FoG), where good ole patriots told me that the only thing that helicopters played was machine guns and rockets! They also provided several illuminating answers about Hollywood BS, and one guy suggesting that playing music might give you away to the enemy, as opposed to the sound of your rockets?\n\nAnyway, I then found [a chapter](http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cx3srf.7)\n of [this book](http://www.bookdepository.com/We-Gotta-Get-Out-of-This-Place/9781625341624) which is where I got the quotes, the references to Meredith Lair's book, and the general information. I assume that book is available in libraries, but it's quite a reasonably priced text and looks like an interesting read. If you want to buy it for a poor student, please PM me ;) Hope this has been an interesting answer!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The 19th century hosted a couple of intellectual developments that drew fresh attention to the story of Jonah in the Hebrew Bible. First, the birth of modern biblical criticism from the 18th century had drawn fresh attention to questions about the historicity of Old Testament stories. Although the rift within American Protestantism with the invention of \"literal\" (spoiler alert: not really, see also Ezekiel 16 and 23)  interpretation in order to defend slavery is more well known today, this also became a major sticking point between liberal/modern Protestant scholars and Catholic scholars. Way back in the 16th century, of course, Martin Luther had barred several traditional books from the Old Testament on their lack of provable historicity, but now other books were coming under fire.\n\nIn 1792, for example, Moravian (then HRE, now Czech Republic) theologian and philologist Johann Jahn--very Catholic--had published an introductory guide to the Bible. He argued on the basis of literary and linguistic evidence that some of the deuterocanonical books barred by Luther were literary creations for the purpose of teaching nice lessons. Crucially for our purposes, though, he lumped the Book of Jonah (which was and is in Protestant Bibles) in with them. The Catholic Church was...not happy, to say the least. His scholarship was censured and he lost his university chair.\n\nThe tensions over Jonah were alive and well as much as a century later. You can hilariously see them play out in the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia--[scroll down to \"Historicity.\"](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08497b.htm) (Hint: it's most of the page.)\n\n> Not a single Father has ever been cited in favor of the opinion that Jonah is a fancy-tale and no fact-narrative at all...To the Rationalist and to the advanced Protestant Biblical scholar these arguments are of no worth whatsoever. They find error not only in Jewish and Christian tradition but in Christ Himself. They admit that Christ took the story of Jonah as a fact-narrative, and make answer that Christ erred; He was a child of His time and represents to us the ideas and errors of His time. The arguments of those who accept the inerrancy of Christ and deny the historicity of Jonah are not conclusive.\n\nSo there was, on one hand, a whole pile of curious resentment/resentful curiosity of the historicity of the Jonah legend. And on the other was the rise of natural history and naturalism in the public eye.\n\nOne of the really awesome things about the explosion of interest in natural history as a more scientific endeavour than earlier \"making collections out of everything as curiosities\" is that so much of the work was concentrated in museums--putting all the developments, cool findings, animal displays that would NEVER pass ethical muster today, right in the public eye. (Plaster casting was gaining ground as its practitioners gained skill, though--in fact, lifelike whale models at the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History were huge national news in the 1900s). And there was a massive market for it, too, in terms of public interest.\n\nOf course, one of the popular things to display--and see--was preserved animals and skeletons. And so you have a trickle of reports from the late 19th and early 20th centuries of, you guessed it, visitors taking the chance to see if they, like Jonah, could fit inside the belly of a whale.\n\nThe most (in)famous account, which still gets play in fundamentalist Christian propaganda, is a 1928 recounting of a ca. 1900 youthful escapade:\n\n> My own experience was in Birmingham about 25 years ago, when teh carcass of a whale was displayed for a week on vacant land in Navigation Street...I was one of twelve men who went into its mouth, passed through its throat, and moved about in what was equivalent to a fair-sized room. Its throat was large enough to serve as a door. Obviously it would be quite easy for a whale of this kind to swallow a man.\n\nThere are a number of similar stories springing up around the time. Not formal experiments, but curious people. Did they actually happen, or is this the sort of \"No s---, there we were\" story that grows in the telling?\n\nIt's interesting to note that there was also, at this time, something of a fad for repeating rumors of modern-day fishermen swallowed by whales. Biblical philologist Paul Haupt in 1907 (who does not accept Jonah as a true story, yet devotes pages upon pages to the question of whether the sea-creature was a sperm whale or a shark) throws the kind of scholarly shade that can only come out of biblical studies:\n\n> It is of course impossible that Jonah should have been alive...after three days and three nights, although it is reported in [German newspaper] that the whaleman James Bradley was, in Feb. 1891, swallowed by a whale,  and on the following day he was taken alive out of its stomach...The sailors had much difficulty restoring him to consciousness. It was not til after three months that James Bradley recovered his reason. He seems to have been much more fortunate in this respect than some distinguished Biblical scholars.</p>",

Moreover, in heaven, either blacks and whites would be equal or blacks would be superior because of the affliction and misery they had suffered at the hands of whites.\"\n\n---\n\nFor slaves, visions of heaven were driven by the circumstances of their daily life, and not much by Biblical writings on heaven (actually true of all people, just more true for slaves who would have been facing basic need deprivation). Slaves wished for less labor, so their visions of heaven emphasized lack of labor. The distinction between Catholic and Protestant is not very important. Degrees of syncreticism would have been the more important factor in determining narratives of the *afterlife* for non-Anglophone slaves.\n\n---\n\nSome additional notes that don't answer any of your questions but might be relevant:\n\n1. Heaven is a place where physical bodies would be restored. This was well-received by slaves who were subjected to brutal conditions and punishments. Also, if you like, compare this to other religious institutions, where deformity might exclude you from whatever was analogous to communion\n\n2. Efforts to think about what sort of people will accumulate due to procession of time are not made. (Partly justified due to beliefs in parousia/advent, ie that the world is constantly in a state of about-to-end-ness.) So for example our slaves and slave owners obviously wrote nothing about their heaven being populated with today's people, today's people write little about heaven being populated with cyberhumans who have artificial limbs that perform better than those designed by God, etc.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Robert Lewis Dabney was a staff officer for Stonewall Jackson during the Civil War and a Presbyterian minister and theologian. As the war ended and after the war, he wrote a biography of Jackson and another book called [\"A defence of Virginia, (and through her, of the South)\"](https://archive.org/details/defenceofvirgini00dabn). I recently read \"A Defence of Virginia\", and it gives one perspective to part of this question (I have not read anything else by Dabney, and have not read any secondary sources on Dabney, so my interpretation of this might not be perfect). Most of the book is Dabney's defense of slavery, including arguing that the bible supports slavery (both the New and Old Testaments). He also talks about slaves in heaven. \n\nHis New Testament argument relies heavily on the epistles, particularly on Philemon and on 1 Corinthians (on page 158-159 of the edition to which I linked) where he argues that Jesus' saved slaves and free people alike:\n>The Apostle Paul teaches that the condition of a slave, although not desirable for its own sake, has no essential bearing on the Christian life and progress; and therefore, when speaking as a Christian minister, and with exclusive reference to man's religious interests, he treats it as unimportant. The proof of this statement may be found in such passages as the following : 1 Cor. xii. 13, \"For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free : and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.\" [...] The drift of all these passages is to teach that a man's reception by Christ and by the Church does not depend in any manner on his class or condition in secular life; because Christianity places all classes on the same footing as to the things of the soul, and offers to all the same salvation.\n\nHe also discusses the curse of Canaan (Canaan was the son of Ham, son of Noah, and not the same as Cain, brother of Ham). In his defense of slavery from an Old Testament perspective, he claims that slavery was not condemned by Abraham or Moses, and that it first existed in the servitude of Canaan decreed by God as a curse (known as the curse of Canaan or the curse of Ham). Some Christians (including, I think, the 3rd century theologian Origen) believe that the Curse of Canaan gave some people black skin and made it so that servants and slaves came from these descendents of Canaan. Dabney notes that this may be true, but does not insist on it (page 102 of the edition to which I linked). Rather, Dabney argues the curse of Canaan is a very early example of God sanctioning slavery (and Dabney frequently uses the word \"sanction\" to describe God's position on slavery).\n\nBack to the main question, I don't think Dabney talks much about slavery in heaven. He notes that Paul talks about Onesimus as a slave of Philemon, but that his condition was \"life-long\", and it reads to me like Dabney does not think Onesimus would continue to be a slave in heaven, writing (on page 185 of the edition to which I linked), \"The Epistle then adds, that Philemon was \"to receive him back forever,\" v. 15 [of the Epistle of Paul to Philemon], i. e., for life.\"\n\nOne personal note: some places on the internet consider Dabney's defense of slavery to have been or even to continue to be valid. I think this is terrible.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>From what I've researched, some slaves in Brazil and Peru--colonies with a large number of slaves in cities as well as in plantations/mines--believed that \"class\" distinctions existed in heaven as on earth. On the other hand, theologians such as Antonio Vieira, the Portuguese-Brazilian priest and ambassador, argued that these racial distinctions disappeared after death. Purgatory washed away spiritual and corporeal markings of sinfulness. What this means, however, was that he viewed people in heaven as white. He often described people with dark skin having \"white\" or \"clean\" souls. \n\nThere's a fantastic primary source that's been edited by Nancy van Deusen about an Afro-Peruvian mystic named Ursula de Jesus. In it, Ursula (a slave who eventually became a beata, or a member of a convent) claims that, in one of her conversations with Jesus, each soul in purgatory was sorted according to his or her \"estado.\" This word can be translated many ways: station, class, state, etc. It brings up a number of questions about how she and others--white and non-white alike--conceptualized the afterlife in a time and place when such marked racial, social, and political differences existed.\n\nSuch a fascinating question!

                "answer": "<p>**Part I**\n\nOne of the important details to understand the condition and release of the inmates held in Spandau were not like other figures incarcerated for Nazi crimes. The emerging Cold War and collapse of Allied unity led what had started as an international process into a national one; the Nuremberg International Military Tribunals (IMT) were followed up by each of the occupying power conducting their own tribunals, often termed National Military Tribunals (NMT- and this is simplifying the process quite a bit, justice varied by zone). The NMT convicted defendants thus ended up as the responsibility of the Allied occupying power, which in turn meant that later amnesties became a bilateral between the respective  Allied High Commissioner and the FRG government. US HICOG chief General John McCloy set the tone for the later \"amnesty fever\" after considerable pressure from the Adenauer government and pardoned some 29 convicted war criminals from Landsberg in 1951. IMT defendants were a different matter as a four-power consensus was needed to alter the IMT sentence for early release or parole. Such a consensus was not forthcoming in Cold War milieu outside of cases of extreme ill-health. Thus Spandau's prisoners tended to serve their full terms. Hess himself was the ultimate example of how the Cold War made Spandau an anomaly for German war criminals. A unique constellation of factors led to this somewhat absurd situation where a large prison complex held only one inmate.  \n\nThe Soviets were the main reason why any move for Hess's or his fellow inmates parole was vetoed. Keeping Spandau open meant that the Soviets could keep their foothold in West Berlin. Once Spandau had closed, then the facility would revert back to the control of West Berlin government. The four powers had initially anticipated a much larger roster of inmates when the four powers agreed to the collective running of Spandau. but the breakdown in Allied unity meant that it had only an anemic number of prisoners. Thus, paroles meant that the site would become irrelevant. Keeping Spandau open had value to the Soviets both for intelligence purposes as well as symbolic importance. In the former, Spandau was a window into West Berlin, and thus was an asset. But arguably more important than its intelligence value, keeping Spandau's inmates was a way to score a moral victory over the West. Unlike the FRG, the GDR did not have an equivalent amnesty-fever and many former Nazis did not creep back into public positions of authority in the SED state like Hans Globke or Hanns Martin Schleyer did in the FRG. Both the Soviets and the GDR made frequent mention of how Western officials like McCloy were more than willing to forget Nazi war crimes if their perpetrators proved useful. Keeping Spandau open due to a very public Soviet intransigence was a way to transform this talking point into concrete reality. While various Westerners advocated for pardons, the Eastern bloc made sure it publicly stood for Nazi criminals receiving their just deserts. \n\nThe GDR press's treatment of Karl D\u00f6nitz exemplified how the GDR politicized the issue of parole and release. Although there was little commentary in the GDR press on the Admiral after his sentencing, D\u00f6nitz swiftly became the subject of hand-wringing in the press as soon as he had served his term. Three days after his 1 October 1956 release, the GDR's main newspapers were carrying stories how the war criminal was now receiving a pension from Bonn. One year later, the 17 August edition of *Berliner Zeitung* had a front-page article, \"Italy Outraged over the Insolence of Hitler's Generals,\" in which D\u00f6nitz along with other convicted and pardoned war criminals sent a telegram to the Italian government pleading for clemency for Walter Reder, who was a Waffen-SS commander responsible for a massacre of Italian civilians in September 1944 . The 5 February 1963 issue of *BZ* had a front-page commentary on how D\u00f6nitz lectured a gymnasium in Schleswig-Holstein on the Second World War. As *BZ* tartly noted:\n\n>On the lesson plan of the 300 pupils was history: the Second World War. For this subject, the director of the gymnasium in Geesthacht facilitated the reappearance as an expert and a guest teacher, Mr. Karl D\u00f6nitz.\n\n>No. This was not a mistake. In fact, it was the successor of the greatest warlord of all times, Adolf Hitler, who appointed him, the Grand Admiral of the Fascist Kriegsmarine, five minutes after noon on May 2, 1945 to form  a new Reich government in Schleswig-Holstein. Later he was arrested and judged a war criminal. \n\nThe *BZ* article further asserts that a convicted war criminal lecturing FRG children was not an anomaly for the West, but was a reflection of Bonn's indifference to the Nazi past and moves towards revanchism. \"Thus D\u00f6nitz can be sure to be in harmony with other Bonn prominents,\" *BZ* notes,\"which makes one's head throb with anger as with other cases of 'coping with the past.'\" Nor did the warming of inter-German relations during the period of detente lead to a lessening of the invective against D\u00f6nitz and his warm reception in quarters of the FRG government. The 17 September 1976 issue of *Neues Deutschland* had a small article \"Bundeswehr Officers honor Hitler's Successor D\u00f6nitz,\" reporting that the Admiral was received warmly by a number of Bundesmarine officers in uniform and this was a sign that many former Nazis were mingling with the newer generation of Bundeswehr officers through organizations like the reestablished *Deutscher Marinebund*(German Navy League). The GDR press made passing reference to D\u00f6nitz after his death noting that the pomp and ceremony of his funeral not only underscored the hypocrisy of Bonn, but that neo-Nazis now needed new blood. Yet the damage wrought by men D\u00f6nitz was done, since \"the Bundeswehr maintains the old brown traditions,\" as 31 January 1981 issue of *BZ* asserted. \n\nThis treatment of D\u00f6nitz was emblematic of how the Eastern politicized and exploited the issue of the Spandau prisoners. A 26 November 1965 *Neue Zeit* article \u201cThe Plague has Escaped: The \u2018F\u00fchrer\u2019 of the \u2018Fourth Reich\u2019 Has Drawn No Lessons from the Nuremberg Process\u201d noted that D\u00f6nitz had used his release to advocate for the clemency of the remaining Spandau inmates Speer, Schirach, and Hess. The article further reported that the remaining inmates were the subject of a PR campaign by the European right, noting that the right-wing FRG magazine *Nation Europa* had claimed in 1954 that Hess\u2019s freedom was a moral imperative for all of Europe. A 9 December 1965 *BZ* piece sarcastically entitled \u201cThe Spirit of Nazism under the Christmas Tree\u201d noted the trend of *Nation Europa* publishing books written by apologists and defenders of Nazi war criminals, including Ilse Hess\u2019s * Gefangener des Friedens* (*Prisoner of Peace*). On 31 December 1968, *BZ* drew a connection between Bonn\u2019s CDU-CSU faction pushing for an end to the extension of the statute of limitations for prosecuting Nazi crimes and clemency for Spandau\u2019s remaining prisoner. The article noted that the state prosecutor Max G\u00fcde, who was opposed to the extension (and in reality his position was more complicated), had earlier in the spring signed a clemency appeal for Hess. *BZ* noted that such a position was hypocritical since G\u00fcde shortly after signing the clemency called for a ban of the Socialist German Student Union. *Pravda* likewise drew a connection between clemency and the current actions and policies of the West. Ina  January 1970 issue answering the calls for clemency, the Soviet propaganda organ noted that:\n\n>Imperialism is always merciful against criminals, whether they be fascists or racists, because the its politics of international piracy and aggression, neocolonialism and racial intolerance is itself criminal. \u2026The answer to [the question of clemency] has already been given in the burning of the South Vietnamese village of Son My- the site of a bloody butcher\u2019s bill by American invaders against its peaceful inhabitants. The answer to this question is also in the ruins of many an Arab settlement bombed by Israeli pilots and destroyed by rockets. The answer is also found in the speeches and slogans publicly stated at the meetings of West German revanchists and neo-Nazis. \n\nFrom the Soviet\u2019s public position, so long as the West pursued policies it portrayed as little different from fascism, then there was no room for clemency. \n\nWhile the Soviet veto was a major factor in preventing Hess\u2019s parole, there were other factors at play that ensured that the other three powers did not press for Hess\u2019s release with much vigor. Unlike military men like Raeder or D\u00f6nitz, Hess lacked a large and organized network of pressure groups in the FRG to consistently advocate for his release. Military veterans groups were one of the main organizers of the FRG\u2019s amnesty fever for NMT defendants and as the GDR\u2019s press would often point out, were also advocates for war criminals serving terms in Western European countries like Italy. Hess\u2019s constituency was much more centered on his son, Wolf R\u00fcdiger. Hess\u2019s son was able to gain some prominent Western Europeans to his cause such as the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, but this was a much looser network than veterans lobbies or the conservative-Christian circles affiliated with Baldur von Schirach. As Norman Goda noted in his study of the Spandau prisoners, most of Hess\u2019s advocates already had axes to grind against the system and saw their partisanship as furthering their cause. Taylor, for example, was a notorious gadfly and by arguing Hess had done nothing wrong, he furthered his own thesis that the Nuremberg trials were a flawed process that distorted the historical record about the outbreak of the war.\n</p>",

According to  Heather Arndt Anderson's book *Breakfast: A History*, there was a morally driven health crusade in the late 19th century in the US. Their broadly prescribed idea was abstain from meat, alcohol, tobacco etc. Many \"sanitariums\" were opened that supposed to improve the health of clients and each place formulated their own menus based on this diet. A prominent figure of the movement was Sylvester Graham who advocated a shift to simple grain-based breakfast and was particularly obsessed with unprocessed flour (and invented graham flour). Another man named James Caleb Jackson who opened Our Home on the Hillside Health Spa tried to create an easy breakfast by first making hard wafers of graham flour that had to be soaked in milk overnight (which defeats the purpose) and he later improved it by breaking the wafer into tiny granules that resulted in something similar to Grape Nuts that was advertised as \"ready for immediate table use\". Around the same time owner of Battle Creek Sanitarium John Harvey Kellogg invented rolled flake cereal (supposedly he tried to salvage cooked wheat that has been left on the stove overnight). They patented the product in 1895. \n\nVarious forms of pancakes have been eaten for millennia. According to *Pancake: A Global History* by Ken Albala, one of the earliest forms for pancakes familiar to Americans is from a 16th century book called *Goodhuswifes Handmaide for the Kitchin*, however most recipes today were derived from Hannah Glasse's 1747 cookbook *The Art of Cookery*. Cornmeal pancakes called johnny cakes or hoecaks were often made by freed black cooks around the same time. By the mid-19th century buttermilk pancake became commonly referred to by cookbooks as a breakfast food. \n\nI'm not sure if muffins are as associated with breakfast as pancakes and cereal (OP should probably specify muffins are considered breakfast food in the US). Most early American recipes for muffins were similar to what Americans would call an English muffin and they were something served for tea time instead of breakfast (and still the case in the British Isles). On the other hand these cookbooks often contain recipes for *tea cakes* in the same tea time recipes that are much closer to American muffins. According to *the Dictionary of American Regional English*, the first time American muffins were called \"muffins* was cited is from a 1879 book called *Housekeeping in Olde Virginia*: \"Another recipe for muffins...make the batter the consistency of pound cake, and bake in snow-ball cups as soon as made.\" \n\nAside from being specifically invented for breakfast like in the case of cereal, most breakfast food were obviously popular for convenience. Considering that most food made in the western world used to require a long and slow cooking that's impractical for morning, so food that could be cooked quickly quickly or could be made ahead of time became popular as breakfast food. </p>",

By the end of World War II, all M2 guns had been converted to M2HB.\n\nSince then there's been other variations for specific uses, but I will skip to 2010 when the M2A1 entered service to replace the M2HB.

Many ancient Greek cities as well as the Romans would keep track of time by tracking the magistrates that served that year. The Romans would, for example, use the list of consuls, who each served for 1 year, to keep track of time. This could get very complicated, however, see this example from Thucydides *History of the Peloponnesian War*\n\n>For fourteen years the thirty years' peace which was concluded after the recovery of Euboea remained unbroken. But in the fifteenth year, when Chrysis the high-priestess of Argos was in the forty-eighth year of her priesthood, Aenesias being Ephor at Sparta, and at Athens Pythodorus having two months of his archonship to run, in the sixth month after the engagement at Potidaea and at the beginning of spring \n\nWhat's going on here is that Thucydides wants to target as wide an audience as possible. He wants people outside of his native Athens to be able to understand his history, but he can't do what a modern historian would do and simply number the years, because there is no standardized year number for anyone, much less a shared one across Greece. So what he does orient to the magistrates and priests of several major cities and major events, in the hopes that everyone reading his work will know when at least one of the events happened, allowing them to place the rest of the events in the history relative to the event they know about. So as you can see, dating events for a wide audience was extremely difficult, and required some creativity on the part of a historian to actually place events in time for everyone reading.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>We can say with certainty bordering the absolute that Hitler never visited one of the Concentration Camps.\n\nAs to why that is, the only answers that can be given here and that are supported by the evidence have to do with leadership style, the inner workings of Nazi Germany, and the purpose of such a visit.\n\nWhat I mean is, what possible reason could there be for Hitler to go to a camp? When the camps were first opened in the beginning of Nazi rule, there was extensive news coverage of this \"new\" method of getting rid of the enemies of the people. [Here](http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/polopoly_fs/1.502021.1359128036!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/zva_quer_540/image.jpg) for example is a newspaper article from the Eschweiler Zeitung from 1933, that says: In Dachau near Munich, the first concentration camp was opened. So, it is not like these camps were particularly secret, especially in connection to imprisoning political enemies and people who had a bad reputation in German society in general, like the so-called \"asocials\".\n\nBut the propagandistical value of a Hitler visit would have been - beyond this initial stage - not really there. While during the war, what happened to the Jews was in its broad strokes an open secret to the German public, it still was not exactly advertised since the Nazis were on the whole rather concious of public opinion. The best example for this is the T4 killing program. Authorized by Hitler in October 1939 (backdated to September), the program of killing handicapped and mentally ill people in six centralized killing facilities became quickly well known in the German public. And they weren't exactly on board with it, especially after the Catholic Church in Germany started preaching against it. The protest turned into one of the very few occasion during which Hitler was booed while giving a speech in Bavaria. Ultimately, the leadership of the Third Reich decided to scrap the program and instead continue the killing in a decentralized fashion further away from the eyes of the German public. (this also being the reason why the order for the Holocaust was later issued orally)\n\nSome of this might also have to do with personality in the sense that according to pretty much all accounts, Hitler was really busy on the one hand but also really lazy on the other. At least until the later stages of the war, appearances in public were mostly for the purpose of giving speeches whipping up support etc., etc. Plus, Hitler hardly ever e.g. inspected Wehrmacht troops either, so why inspect a CC?\n\nIn terms of style of leadership and the inner political workings of the Third Reich, it also would not have made particular sense. Franz Neumann of the Institute for Social Research and later the Frankfurt School describes the Nazi state as the Behemoth, a hommage to Hobbes' treaty about the Parliament of the long bench and Cromwell.What means that coming from his understanding of the modern state, the Nazi dictatorship can be described as the anti-state. This is in the sense that rather than having clear cut functions and responsibilities, the Third Reich is infamous for agencies and institutions having the exact same areas of responsibility and policy, vying for control by acting in a way that they assume is in line with Hitler's wishes. Hitler did intervene in these conflicts, yet was always careful that no side accumulated too much power.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are known as Himmler's fiefdom. This was not always the case but rather also the outcome of a process of control vying within the Reich. At some point in 1935/36 the total number of CC prisoners numbered around 3000 and - of course - the ministry of the interior and the ministry of justice pushed so that even those still in existence should be closed down because the normal prisons could handle the prisoners fine.\n\nSimilarly, after the whole CC system had expanded again and also turned into an important economic factor with regards to forced labor but also the SS-owned companies, there were different factions within the concentration camp system, generally divisible in the original Dachau School and the later Lichtenburg School. What this refers to is that pretty much all the later Concentration Camp commanders had started their career either in Dachau or in Lichtenberg.\n\nA visit from Hitler in any of these situations would have been seen as a declaration of support for any potential group within these conflicts, something Hitler tended to avoid if not immediately necessary.\n\nSimilarly, and especially during the war when Hitler was very busy in terms of military planning etc., he did have Himmler, whom he trusted, who did the inspections of the Camps and informed him of what was going on. Himmler met Hitler often and usually updated him about the state of the Holocaust and of his visits to the camps, which he performed quite often.\n\nInterestingly enough, Himmler's visit to one of these execution sites lead to a pretty important change: In October 1941 Himmler visits an Einsatzgruppen mass shooting in Minsk. Upon being confronted with the gruesome work, his aides described that he was not feeling very well and went green. Seeing these executions, Himmler made it is his priority to make the killing more humane for the perpetrators and thus the idea of gassing on large scale was born. Using the concept of the Crimiological Technical Institute, first gas vans and alter gas chambers were built in order to make it easier on those carrying out the executions.\n\nSo, in conclusion:The most likely factors why Hitler never visited a Concentration Camp are due to political and propagandistic considerations, because he was informed about what went on while at the same time being busy, and because he had his guy, Himmler, for that.\n\nSources:\n\n* Ian Kershaw: Hitler.\n\n* Richard Evans' Third Reich Triology.\n\n* Peter Longerich: Holocaust.</p>",

This is also why the overwhelming majority of concentration and death camps were in captured territory such as Poland, because they were kept out of the sight of the German people. To extend this, it would lead one to surmise that Hitler didn't visit the camps because he did not want his name or any photographs of him to be taken at the camps because it would break his policy.\n\nMods, I apologize, I am on mobile and I can't provide any documentation for my sources at this time, so if you believe it doesn't fit, take it down.\n\nEdit: it appears I did not read his post as accurately as I thought and he already included the T4 program</p>",

                "answer": "<p>There are a couple things to keep in mind when we read Biblical texts.  The first is, we have to analyze what we are reading, when it was written, what genre it is, who the author is, and what is the main point of the text.  (this means we are treating the Biblical text in the exact same manner we would treat any other ancient text).\n\nSo, the first thing we know about this is that it was written well after the events it tells us about.  It's not a firsthand account of what happens, but rather a record of ancestral tradition.\n\nNext, we look for parallels in the ancient world.  Are there other similar occasions where lifespans are listed as being incredibly long?  As it happens, the answer is actually yes.  The most well-known example is the [Sumerian King List](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm), which is a list of all the kings of Sumer, and how long they reigned.  It includes such passages as:\n\n>In Eridug, Alulim became king; he ruled for 28800 years. Alaljar ruled for 36000 years. 2 kings; they ruled for 64800 years.\n\nIt goes on to mention dozens of kings whose rule extends for millennia each.\n\nSo we have examples of lists of important people with extroardinary numbers listed as their ages in multiple examples from the Ancient Near East.  So there is a precedent for the Old Testament to do this.\n\nSome scholars believe that the numbers are being used in a more symbolic way, rather than mathematically.  The cultures of Mesopotamia were experts in numbers.  They advanced a lot of key mathematical concepts that we still use today (including our division of time into units of 60).  They actually discovered such things as logarithms, ad used mathematical ratios in their architecture.  They also knew about the Pythagorean Theorem (you know, A^2 + B^2 = C^2) and used it.\n\nThe Sumerians and other Mesopotamian peoples (since at least 3100 BC) used a *sexagesimal* numbering system, which means that it was base 60, instead of our base 10.  Why? Because 60 is the lowest number divisible by all of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, making fractions much easier.\n\nThere were a lot of ambiguous things included in this numbering system, such as blank spaces possibly meaning zero, and less value put on the importance of position of the numbers (tens and hundreds place for example).  Practically, this was not much of an issue for the scribes, because their numbers were always in a context that made them very interpretable (amounts of grain, weights of money, etc). Later scribes (such as Hebrews trying to interpret such numbers) would have a much more difficult time without the context.\n\nThe biggest issue with Mesopotamian numbers, however, is the idea of sacred numbers.  Some numbers had a symbolic meaning beyond their mathematical meaning, and therefore were *numerological* rather than *numerical* in some contexts, meaning that its symbolic value would be used rather than its mathematical value.\n\nNow, what connection does this have to the Biblical chronologies?  The numbers are based on the Mesopotamian system of numbers.  All the ages in the Genesis genealogies fall into two categories: numbers divisible by 5 (ending in 5 or 0), and multiples of 5 with the addition of 7 (or two 7s).  5 years = 60 months.  The final digits are *always* 0, 7, 5, 2, and 9.  2 because 5+7 = 1**2**, and 9 because 5+7+7 = 1**9**.  The odds are astronomical that there would not be a number in the list that did not match.  Therefore, we have a lot of indications that these are symbolic numbers, based on a very different number system.  We don't know what meaning these numbers may have had.\n\nAdditional evidence for these being symbolic rather than real can be seen in the fact that many of the patriarchs' ages overlap significantly, and impossibly according to the narrative.  Additionally, there are different numbers among various ancient translations of the text (specifically the Hebrew Masoretic Text and the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the Septuagint).\n\nTherefore, the numbers in Genesis are most likely symbolic of something we do not know, and are based on a numerical system established by the Sumerians, and eventually lost over time.  Thus, the ancient traditions of the symbology were likely lost and the compilers of the Hebrew Bible themselves did not understand the symbology behind the ages.\n\nSources:\n\n\n* [Carol A.

                "answer": "<p>Almost certainly we do not have access to the \"originals\", but rather we have access to what is either a putting down of an/a few oral tradition sometime around the time of Josiah, or else more likely a translation into more modern language done about that time from older texts. (paraphrasing from my Biblical Archaeology class).\n\nThere are some reasons to assume less than total accuracy in the numbers in the Pentateuch for a few reasons.  First, it lists two midwives for six hundred thousand people. So maybe it's more like six hundred families. Looking specifically at the ages of the Patriarchs, this is a list that has correlates with other similar lists.  For example, if you take the list of the ages of the Sumerian preflood kings, and assume that instead of being in a sexigesimal system (base sixty) they are instead part of a base ten system, you end up with a list of ages that are equivalent to the Biblical one, albeit rounded to the nearest ten. As time goes by, many of these cultures went through a number of different number systems, as well as different ways of representing numbers.\n\nWhat this suggests is that, accurate or not, the accepted ages of these individuals was likely stable within oral history for a seriously long time before being written down.  The earliest record of the Sumerian king list comes from about 2000BC - here's a copypaste from wikipedia:\n\n\"After the kingship descended from heaven, the kingship was in Eridug. In Eridug, Alulim became king; he ruled for 28800 years.\"\nAlulim\t\t8 sars (28,800 years)\tmythological\t\nAlalngar\t\t10 sars (36,000 years)\t\t\n\"Then Eridug fell and the kingship was taken to Bad-tibira.\"\nEn-men-lu-ana\t\t12 sars (43,200 years)\t\t\nEn-men-gal-ana\t\t8 sars (28,800 years)\t\t\nDumuzid, the Shepherd \t\"the shepherd\"\t10 sars (36,000 years)\t\t\n\"Then Bad-tibira fell and the kingship was taken to Larag.\"\nEn-sipad-zid-ana\t\t8 sars (28,800 years)\t\t\n\"Then Larag fell and the kingship was taken to Zimbir.\"\nEn-men-dur-ana\t\t5 sars and 5 ners (21,000 years)\t\t\n\"Then Zimbir fell and the kingship was taken to Shuruppag.\"\nUbara-Tutu\t\t5 sars and 1 ner (18,600 years)\t\t\n\"Then the flood swept over.\"[19]\n\nTranslation errors regarding numbers definitely exist in biblical accounts, and in particular, definitely exist in lists of preflood rulers/patriarchs in the region, as they can't all be right. Furthermore, the author's almost *certainly* believed their ancestors lived that long, as Genesis/Exodus even includes an explanation as to why they lived shorter lives, and stories within the bible give evidence to a continued gradual decrease in lifespan, from Methuselah (almost a thousand) to Noah (some six hundred I think) to Shem (something like 300) to Terah, to Abraham (180) down to Moses (120) and so on.\n\nMy best bet is that the authors wrote this way because that is what they believed to be true.  Furthermore, the ancestors of the authors had believed this to be true for something well over a thousand years if not considerably longer, but in that time linguistic change could have led to re-analyzed number systems (as in the Sumerian/Babylonian system) and some kind of age inflation.\n\nfor me the most interesting aspect of studying these lists is that the Hebrew account seems to be the one least affected by rounding errors, despite being first recorded a number of generations later than the Sumerian list,  suggesting that at least in terms of numerical accuracy, the Hebrew version is a more conservative transmission of the common myth that was present in both cultures.\n\nEdit: After some googling, I found a fairly detailed comparison of these two lists, from of all places, [answers in genesis](https://answersingenesis.org/bible-history/the-antediluvian-patriarchs-and-the-sumerian-king-list/).  In there they include the following fairly cool representation of how the ages would have been written down using a writing system of the day, just to give an idea of what these numbers may have looked like at the time:\n\n[image 1](https://cdn-assets.answersingenesis.org/img/articles/tj/v12/i3/v12n3_sumerian_fig7.jpg)</p>",

He was a pacifist for dozens of centuries while his people were starving and unhappy in their crowded cities.  Genghis Khan's and Alexander the Great's encroachments into his territory probably pushed him over the edge; his people wanted more land to move into, thus forcing him to build up his military might to be greater than theirs. Additionally, Bismarck and Sejong were quickly gaining technological advancements that he could not keep up with.  Surely the pressures made him snap into an all-out retaliation.

                "answer": "<p>Gandhi tells us himself... Sort of.  Regarding the Bhagavad Gita, he [said](http://www.bhagavad-gita.us/famous-reflections-on-the-bhagavad-gita/): \"When doubts haunt me, when disappointments stare me in the face, and I see not one ray of hope on the horizon, I turn to Bhagavad-gita and find a verse to comfort me.\"\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita is a dialogue between Arjuna (the leader of an army) and Krishna (his charioteer, also God in disguise).  Arjuna asks Krishna if the imminent war with his family is the right thing to do.  Krishna answers that it is (although there's slightly more nuance to it than that and it takes about 150 pages).  Then Arjuna fights the Battle of Kurukshetra.  Nearly all warriors on both sides die (around four million), with only a handful of main characters left standing.  The battle itself is not technically part of the Gita, but it forms an important context.\n\nSo to sum up, in times of doubt, Gandhi turned to a text where a national leader asks God if it's alright to slaughter enemies by the millions, while losing millions of his own people in the process. Then he does so.  The question isn't \"why was he obsessed with nukes,\" it's \"why are we still alive to ask?\"\n\nI'm afraid the answer to that goes beyond my expertise.\n\nEdit: you asked about Gandhi's character, and whether it conflicted with his nuclear policy.  While I can't give you a definitive answer, I can tell you that he was far from the only leader to display such a conflict.  Take Isabella of Spain, a devout Roman Catholic who, throughout her life, confessed the Christian faith and advocated, in her writings and especially her biography, the forced Christianization of foreign peoples and the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims.  Despite this, she made Judaism the state religion (with the justification \"Both Christianities are taken and this [Judaism] has the prettiest symbol'\") and even had her diplomats lobby to make it the world religion.  People in her own court lobbied her to \"load down Sons of Abraham and expel the Jews,\" but her only reply was the paradoxical statement \"This is not yes what thou!\" (The enigmatic \"yes what thou\" has come down to us verbatim as \"Si que tu!\").  \"Si que tu\" (or rather an acronym that phonetically sounds like \"si que tu\" when pronounced in English) has since become a rallying cry for advocates of ethnic cleansing, religious violence, political assassination, eugenics, and (strangely enough) sibling marriage.\n\nSo when you get down to it, Gandhi's legacy isn't *that* weird.</p>",

Early in his career, no conditions existed that would cause him to ever act hostile toward his neighbors, even if they were colonizing near his cities. However, something very strange happened to Gandhi the First when he reformed his country and adopted Democracy. Gandhi became the most warlike, aggressive, warmonger-er to ever live. Gandhi declared war on every country in the world and fired ICBMs at every major city. Most people wrongly think that nukes corrupted Gandhi, but in fact he had spent many years as a King sitting on ICBMs for defensive purposed without anyone realizing until he became President.\n\nPsychologists theorize that this has to do with the 255 Principle. Basically, due to the limitations of the human mind, there are only 255 states of aggression. We all know living in a Democracy will lower someone's aggression by about 10, on a scale of 1-255. Psychologists believe Gandhi was born with such low aggression, probably less than 10, that when he started living in Democracy, his aggression actually swung around, having no where to go, but to the 250ish range. Basically, Gandhi was so passive it turned out to be a serious personality flaw latter in life.\n\nGandhi the Second and Third, probably is better asked at  r/theology.

Contextually, John Ehrlichman was counsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under President Richard Nixon. He organized the group of aides responsible for the Watergate break-in. He ended up serving a year and a half in prison for his contribution to that crime. In the interview, Ehrlichman [had this to say](http://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/):\n\n>The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\n\nFor what it's worth, other Nixon aides have contested that statement but that breaks the 20-year rule so I will refrain from discussing it further. To underline the intent of Nixon, I additionally refer to [this transcript](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-07/news/9911070165_1_oval-office-tapes-nixon-john-d-ehrlichman) of a recorded conversation between Nixon and Ehrlichman wherein Nixon has this to say:\n\n> We're going to (place) more of these little Negro bastards on the welfare rolls... \n\n> [Mexican-Americans] don't live like a bunch of dogs, which the Negroes do live like.\n\nSo, it's fairly clear that Nixon himself wasn't overly politically correct, and harbored significant biases against the African-American community of the time. This lends additional credence to Ehrlichman's description of the Nixon's 'War on Drugs' as a racially motivated campaign to discredit Nixon's political enemies. \n\nTo present an alternate explanation for the 'War on Drugs', Nixon was apparently equally concerned about the effect 'dope' was having on the country at large. From the same recorded conversation, he had this to say:\n\n> Let's look at the strong societies, the Russians. Goddamn, they root [homosexuals] out. They don't let 'em around at all. I don't know what they do with them. Look at this country. You think the Russians allow dope? Homosexuality, dope, immorality are the enemies of strong societies. That's why the communists and left-wingers are clinging to one another. They're trying to destroy us. I know Moynihan will disagree with this, (Atty. Gen. John) Mitchell will, and Garment will. But, goddamn, we have to stand up to this.\n\nSo, one could construe that he was concerned about the effects that his political enemies were having on the fabric of American society rather than the race of his enemies. It's clear, however, that Richard Nixon held considerably conservative views on African Americans, and the Social Left. \n\nPlease let me know if I can clarify anything, or if this post does not meet the community standards. I'm sorry I wasn't able to answer your main question, but I hope I shed some light on Richard Nixon, the 'War on Drugs' and its intent.\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>While there is no evidence of a plan or plot by the FBI or any other government agency to deliberate flood Oakland, California, specifically and Black communities more generally with heroin or cocaine, it could be argued, nonetheless, that there is a kind of truth to these allegations in terms of how US drug enforcement policies have caused great harm to African-American communities and also because it has been well documented that the CIA have been complicit in the drug trade.\n\nThe thesis that black communities in the US were deliberately flooded with heroin on the orders of J Edgar Hoover appears to be an inference from a 4 March 1968 COINTELPRO memorandum outlining measures to be taken against black nationalist groups. In the memorandum it was stated that:\n\n>A final goal should be to prevent the long-range growth of militant black nationalist organizations, especially among youth. Specific tactics to prevent these groups from converting young people must be developed. \n\nmeasures should be taken to prevent the growth of militant black nationalist organizations among black youths.  As stated by, Professor Nkechi Taifu, director of the Howard University Law School Equal Justice Program:\n\n>\u2026 as we look at the drug trade\u2014crack and heroin\u2014I think that they have been very successful with respect to some of these tactics\n\nWhen, during the 1970s, there was a heroin epidemic in many American urban areas, the Black Liberation Army kidnapped and killed several drug dealers. They justified these actions on the basis that there was \u2018a government conspiracy to flood ghetto communities with heroin and aestheticize its restive denizens\u2019 (claim derived from an interview with Dhoruba Wahad).  \n\nThis plot was also dramatized in Mario Van Peebles\u2019s film *Panther* the climax to which implied that when Hoover realised that the Black Panther Party would continue to grow despite the best efforts of his agency he directed the FBI to collaborate with the Mafia to flood Black urban communities with cheap cocaine and heroin. \n\n>There is no direct evidence that the FBI worked with the Mafia to bring narcotics into Oakland; however, the film\u2019s suggestion that drug enforcement policies have harmed Black communities does have a factual basis. During the 1990s, when audiences were most likely to have seen *Panther*, African-Americans were four times more likely than whites to face prison terms for using narcotics. Mario Van Peebles told an *Essence* magazine interviewer that there is a ring of \u201ctruth\u201d to the idea that drug-control policies in the United States are evidence of racial discrimination. Noting the film\u2019s \u201cparallel between the then and now of drugs and alcohol being brought into the Black Community,\u201d Van Peebles added, \u201cThese same communities that were insisting on power to the people have been flooded with alcohol and drugs; they\u2019ve been medicated.\n\nLikewise, for some commentators such as Professor Michael Eric Dyson (Sociology, Georgetown University), even in the absence of direct proof, the plot was a \u2018plausible answer to why heroin and then crack cocaine flooded into the ghetto\u2019.\n\nAs is well documented, the heroin trade was certainly facilitated by the US intelligence services. Until the early 1970s, most of the heroin that arrived in the New York was funneled via Marseille through what is popularly known as the \u201cFrench Connection\u201d. Marseille had been an important site for the production of drugs prior to World War II, but only became internationally significant in the post-war period. In part, this was due to US concerns about the possible spread of communism to France, especially Marseille (which was also strategically important), where worker\u2019s unions and the Communist Party were quite strong. The strongest force against communism in Marseille was the Corsican Mafia and US agents elected to collaborate with them to break up strikes and attack Communists. In return for this assistance, US agents turned a blind eye to mafia\u2019s criminal activities and the Corsican Mafia consolidated their grip on the port of Marseille and increased the production and sale of heroin. The first heroin laboratory was founded in Marseille in 1951. The Corsican Mafia allied with the US-Italian Mafia (Charles \u2018Lucky\u2019 Luciano), who had also been the beneficiaries of US strategic policies, who took Turkish opium, processed it into morphine in the Lebanon and then into heroin in Sicily and Marseille. Marseille took over most of the heroin production as it was politically protected and had the labs there had the capacity to produce grade 4 heroin (the type that is soluble and can be injected). The US-Italian and Corsican Mafias then exported the heroin to the US in collaboration with other criminals such as Meyer Lansky. Marseille produced the bulk of the heroin for the US market over the next 20 years or so. However, as the threat of communism in France declined and amid growing frustration that the French authorities were doing little to control this drug trade and US policy, under Nixon, was to close the French Connection in the early 1970s through applying pressure on the French and Turkish governments. This was achieved in 1973. J. Edgar Hoover, of course, had long argued that there was no such thing as the Mafia in the US. It has been speculated that he may have formed relationships with key Mafia figure prior to the war and that he used them as informants in exchange for protection. He apparently met regularly with Mafia leader Frank Costello. \n\nFrom the 1950s, facilitated by police corruption, heroin use became prevalent in the US especially among minorities in large urban centres. In cities such as Baltimore, and unlike in Harlem, heroin usage increased slowly during the 1950s and much more dramatically from the early 1960s, culminated in a heroin epidemic that only petered out in the early 1970s. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, due to disputes within US Mafia organisations, the Cuban revolution (used as a conduit to transport European heroin to the US) and Robert Kennedy\u2019s campaign against the mafia all interfered with the importation and distribution of heroin. It also led to the development of a new distribution system that would result in a heroin epidemic. The crackdown on the Mafia ended in 1963, with the Kennedy assassination. Carlo Gambino seized control of several Mafia families, gaining the New York waterfront (important as a conduit for European heroin) and later Lucchese empire and the Teamster\u2019s Union at JFK airport. Meantime, the loss of Cuba acted as in incentive to increase other forms of revenue, such as the heroin trade, while the arrival of many Cubans in the US provided manpower for distribution. Further, the 1956 Narcotics Control Act introduced harsh penalties for drug trafficking and this introduced changes into how the Mafia managed the drug trade. Thereafter, they dealt with heroin only at the uppermost level of the commodity chain and turned lower level distribution over to others, especially African-Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York. Similarly ethnic shifts in heroin distribution are evident in Miami (Cuban refugees in the Trafficante organization). In city\u2019s such as Baltimore, local criminals (principally Little Melvin Williams) linked up with New York African-American dealers (e.g. Frank \u2018Pee Wee\u2019 Matthews) by the mid-1960s. Reliable access to cheap Turkish heroin by a new breed of mercenary profiteer dealer helped foment a heroin epidemic in the city by the mid/late 1960s.\n\nDidn't have time to do Weber's 'Dark Alliance' series \n\n>Agar M and Schacht Reisinger H (2002) A Heroin Epidemic at the Intersection of Histories: The 1960s Epidemic among African Americans in Baltimore. *Medical Anthropology* 21(2): 115\u2013156.\n>Bewley-Taylor D (2001) Cracks in the Conspiracy: the CIA and the Cocaine Trade in South Central Los Angeles. *International Journal of Drug Policy* 12(2): 167\u2013180.\n>Bewley-Taylor D (2008) Crack in the Lens: Hollywood, the CIA and the African-American Response to the \u2018Dark Alliance\u2019 series. *Intelligence and National Security* 23(1): 81\u2013102\n>Day S and Whitehorn L (2001) Human Rights in the United States: The Unfinished Story of Political Prisoners and Cointelpro. *New Political Science* 23(2): 285\u2013297\n>Friesendorf C (2007) *US Foreign Policy and the War on Drugs: Displacing the Cocaine and Heroine Industry*.

Here are a few older threads I can point to about Indo-European religion:\n\n * [Besides word roots, are we able to identify similar cultural traits (\u00e9pos, religious practices, etc.) found both in Europe and Iran/India that we can ascribe to common \"Indo-European\" heritage?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/287ezv/besides_word_roots_are_we_able_to_identify/).  In this thread, the now deleted /u/Rosemary85 (may his memory be a blessing) ads some interesting stuff to what I know.  \n\nJust as a start, the [Wikipedia article about the Indo-European pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_religion) has a listing of the etymological connections between many of the Indo-European gods' names (their roles are analogous).  Not every god, not every common story element, not every myth, not every ritual survived long enough to be recorded in writing.  In fact, it's safe to say that *most* don't, which means it's very difficult to reconstruct what Proto-Indo-European religion looked like.  In this sense, we can see that religion in many ways changes much more quickly than language and in more irregular ways.  It's especially difficult because, religion more easily introduces new elements than language and, while two it's unlikely that two languages develop similar structure, it's actually much more likely that two religions do. Which is to say, it's not surprising that non-European religions have a trope of an older generation of gods being usurped by a younger generation of gods, even if we might also identify that as a common Indo-European element.  As I said in a [different older comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40mwfr/are_there_any_mythsoral_historiestales_that_can/cyvp0e9?context=1):\n\n>On a more basic level, there's wide agreement that there was [an Indo-European pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_religion), though when you look more carefully at it you realize just how much these myth changed even as their names remained related, though then you some parts (like the three fate goddesses) reoccur clearly across space and language. But even these are strongly present some places and completely absent others (I know of no direct Vedic equivalent, for example, though there are several three headed gods and goddess, Durga for instance, as well as triple goddesses like Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati that could potentially be related). It's hard to do. Mythology is more fluid than language, especially before writing, and with language you would traditionally use a [Swadesh list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list) of a two hundred or so words to establish a genuine genetic relationship between languages. You just wouldn't even expect that many deities, so you have some religious terms, some mythic tropes, some members of the pantheon, and some specific phrasings (a la Watkins), but it's hard to weave them all together. \n\nI'm unfortunately only up on the literature through about the 1980's (I read through the old works of one of my favorite scholars, Bruce Lincoln, for fun as an undergraduate, and he left the subject in the 1980's) so, while I can give more detail than other posters here about Indo-European religion (they're giving two or three line responses), I actually don't know that much more detail than what I wrote up in the post linked above.  I certainly don't know what the state of the art historical thinking is about Indo-European religion.</p>",

Of the many texts describing the hedonism one could find at Baiae, many of them give us specific details about activities there, including some which directly mention the beach (All translations mine):\n\nIn Letter 51 of his *Moral Epistles*, Seneca the Younger describes his disdain for such activities, writing:\n\n\"Not only for the body but also for our morals should we choose a healthy place: just as I\u2019m unwilling to live amongst torturers, I don\u2019t want to live amongst eating-houses. To see drunks wandering on the beaches, and the revels of sailors, and the lakes noisy with the songs of musical performances, and other things which luxury, as if freed from laws, not only sins in but even makes public\u2013why should this be necessary?\"\n\nIn section 35 of his defense speech *Pro Caelio*, Cicero describes the accusations of debauchery at Baiae leveled against Clodia:\n\n\"The accusers throw out lusts, loves, adulteries, acts at Baiae, banquets, revelries, singing, music, and ships...\"\n\nOne of Propertius' *Elegies*, 1.11, ends with the poet, lamenting that his lover Cynthia is currently spending her time at Baiae, saying:\n\n\"Leave corrupt Baiae as soon as you can,\n\nThose shores will bring discord to many,\n\nThe shores which are inimical to chaste girls:\n\nOh, let the waters of Baiae fade away, an offense to love!\"\n\nThese are just a few examples of the reputation of Baiae, which was frequented by many upper-class Romans, including several Emperors and, according to Seneca's letter, Hannibal Barca during his campaign in Italy. So yes, Romans did go to the beach, that much is indicated by the specifics of these texts. Most of Baiae is underwater now due to volcanic activity, but there are some additional archeological examples, such as the Grotto at the vacation palace of Tiberius in the modern coastal town of Sperlonga, which also lies in the Bay of Naples. Tiberius' palace lies right on the beach and contains some [magnificent sculptures](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/The_Blinding_of_Polyphemus%2C_cast_reconstruction_of_the_group%2C_Sperlonga_%2814969535228%29.jpg) depicting events from the Odyssey, which would have been placed in a [massive grotto](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Villa_Di_Tiberio_Cave.jpg) lying just above the water.\n\nHowever, it must be stressed that almost any sort of vacation in classical Rome would have been available to only the upper class, and because of the travel time involved in traveling down the Appian Way from Rome to Baiae, such occasions would likely not be as short-lived as a modern weekend trip to the beach.\n\nAll in all, it seems like the Romans enjoyed going to the beach as much as we do!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev was the man most affected. He was sent aboard the *Mir* station as a Soviet cosmonaut 3rd Class, and, after 313 days up there, the then 34 year old flight engineer returned to Earth to a very different political structure at home than when he had left. Even his hometown, once called Leningrad when he left Earth, was upon his return now called St. Petersburg.\n\nKrikalev was actually stranded aboard *Mir* for a period. He was supposed to come home about four months earlier than he did, but due to Russian financial issues and political battling between Russia and Kazakhstan (where the former USSR's Baikonur Cosmodrome was located, as well as where the capsule touchdown location was), he was forced to stick around aboard the station for much longer than anticipated. \n\nThere is a great documentary film that actually covers Krikalev's experience. It is called [*\"Out Of The Present\"*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123211/). In the film, it seems that Krikalev tried to be largely unaffected by the breakup of the USSR, and instead sunk himself into focusing on the more \"mundane\" tasks of keeping the station functioning, doing repair work and some science to occupy his time between sleep/eat periods, as well as watching the Earth pass below him as he orbited our planet at 240 miles altitude every 92 minutes. At one point in the film, a Russian journalist, via radio uplink, asks Krikalev how he felt about the (political) changes on the ground and what he considers to be most impressive about them, Krikalev initially answers by offering a non-response, saying he \"did not understand the question\" (though it seems he clearly did). After being prodded further by the journalist, he finally and rather cryptically comments on how he thinks \"darkness has just turned to light\". He left himself an 'out' with that answer, as it was unknown whether he was making a political statement or rather was just referring to the fact that *Mir* had just passed through orbital sunrise at that time. ;) He then continued by saying *\"Winter has come, and before it was summer. Now, it\u2019s beginning to bloom again. That\u2019s the most impressive change you can see from space\u201d*.\n\nKeep in mind that Krikalev was sequestered away on *Mir* during the Soviet breakup, orbiting our planet 16 times a day, with Mission Control being his only real source of news (though he was allowed to talk to his wife Lena once a week or so via radio), so he faced a lot of censorship issues where he was not told the full, complete story of what was happening. He was informed of the coup attempts and breakup of his former USSR of course, but many of the political issues that affected his flight were largely kept from him or at least downplayed heavily, including the fact that the team at Mission Control had threatened to go on strike because they had not been paid in months and there was no money to pay for resupply missions or to send a replacement crew up and to bring him home. According to Sergei, his biggest personal worry while on orbit aboard *Mir* during this period was on how his family was coping with the turmoil back home. Krikalev's salary at the time was a rather paltry 500 rubles a month, so he did make comments to MCC and questioned his wife over the radio concerning how his family was managing financially. Considering the fact that the ruble's value had plummeted after the breakup, he wanted to ensure his loved ones were taken care of while he was away from Earth, which was something that was of course decidedly out of his hands and caused him considerable stress. Politically though, he recognized that he would just have to ride things out and play a game of \"hurry up and wait\" until the powers that be figured out what to do with him and the space station he occupied.  \n\nBack home, Krikalev was actually dubbed by Russian newspapers as \"The Man Who Is Sick of Flying\", and they also called him \"The Last Soviet Citizen\". It became clear he just wanted to come home as soon as was technically, financially, and politically possible. It was becoming clear to Sergei that he was being treated as an unwitting political pawn between the new Russia and Kazakhstan - as Russia relied on the Kazakh's heavily since their former Soviet space launch facilities were located there. This political issue regarding how much a new independent Kazakhstan was demanding to be paid versus how much Russia was willing to pay was serving to delay his return to Earth, as well as delaying resupply missions being sent to him aboard *Mir*, but he recognized that there was little he could do about it, other than just do his job as professionally as possible (which by all accounts he most certainly did), and sit and wait for the politicians to sort things out on Earth.  \n\nI would highly recommend you watch the documentary *\"Out Of The Present\"* if you can, as it gives a fairly decent look at the way the breakup of the USSR affected both the *Mir* program and cosmonaut Krikalev specifically. You can watch it online I believe, though I can't/won't post the direct links here, as I am unsure of the protocol/legality on that. Google is your friend though!\n\nIncidentally, Krikalev's *Mir* flight would not be his last journey to space. He later flew aboard the US space shuttle twice on missions STS-60 and STS-88, and also flew to the ISS twice as well, on Expedition #1 and Expedition #11 (in which he was station Commander, spending six months aboard). He has flown in space six times, and has a flight log cumulative total of 803 days, 9 hours, and 39 minutes in space. The dude is a real Russian \"Top Gun\" cosmonaut, and currently is the Vice-President of *RSC Energia*, which is the prime contractor for Russia's manned spaceflight program. By all accounts, he handled the news of the breakup of the USSR very professionally, with his primary focus being on ensuring the safety of his family and doing all he could from space to make sure they were not suffering too badly and had food on the table while he was away.  \n\n  </p>",

The Nazis generally generate a lot of answers, but looking through the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq/militaryhistory/wwii/nazigermany), there doesn't seem to be anything there. \n\nSo to start, I think its important to remember that Hitler was not so much the originator of the various racial theories embraced by Nazism as the inheritor of them. The specific origin of the term \"aryan\" to mean a subset of white, Christian Europeans who generally spoke a Germanic language is usually attributed to Arthur de Gobineau. Gobineau was a French aristocrat during the Third Republic and in his essays argued that the dominant and only creative branch of human society was a group called the Aryans, which he could trace from ancient times to the present day, primarily through linguistics with a whole lot of bad historical method mixed in. Because I don't think I can give it any better justice than the man himself, I'm going to quote at length from his essay [*The Inequality of Human Races*](https://archive.org/stream/inequalityofhuma00gobi/inequalityofhuma00gobi_djvu.txt). The following is a list of the great civilizations of world history: \n\n>I. The Indian civilization, which reached its highest point round the Indian Ocean, and in the north and east of the Indian Continent, south-east of the Brahmaputra. It arose from a branch of a white people, the Aryans.  \n>II. The Egyptians, round whom collected the Ethiopians, the Nubians, and a few smaller peoples to the west of the oasis of Ammon. This society was created by an Aryan colony from India, that settled in the upper valley of the Nile.  \n>III. The Assyrians, with whom may be classed the Jews, the Phoenicians, the Lydians, the Carthaginians, and the Hymiarites. They owed their civilizing qualities to the great white invasions which may be grouped under the name of the descendants of Shem and Ham. The Zoroastrian Iranians who ruled part of Central Asia under the names of Medes, Persians, and Bactrians, were a branch of the Aryan family.  \n>IV. The Greeks, who came from the same Aryan stock, as modified by Semitic elements.  \n>V. The Chinese civilization, arising from a cause similar to that operating in Egypt. An Aryan colony from India brought the light of civilization to China also. Instead however of becoming mixed with black peoples, as on the Nile, the colony became absorbed in Malay and yellow races, and was reinforced, from the north-west, by a fair number of white elements, equally Aryan but no longer Hindu.  \n>VI. The ancient civilization of the Italian peninsula, the cradle of Roman culture. This was produced by a mixture of Celts, Iberians, Aryans, and Semites.  \n>VII. The Germanic races, which in the fifth century transformed the Western mind. These were Aryans.  \n>VIII. -X. The three civilizations of America, the Alleghanian, the Mexican, and the Peruvian.   \n\n>Of the first seven civilizations, which are those of the Old World, six belong, at least in part, to the Aryan race, and the seventh, that of Assyria, owes to this race the Iranian Renaissance, which is, historically, its best title to fame. Almost the whole of the Continent of Europe is inhabited at the present time by groups of which the basis is white, but in which the non-Aryan elements are the most numerous. There is no true civilization, among the European peoples, where the Aryan branch is not predominant. \n\nThe term Aryan, by the way, was understood at the time (and still is to a certain extent today, I believe, although I'm not up to date on that literature) as signifying a group of conquerors in Ancient India who eventually installed themselves at the top of the then nascent caste system. I'm not an expert on Indian history, so I'm not sure how accurate that understanding is, but it's definitely accurate in the sense of that being what folks thought in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Gobineau does not state explicitly why he chose the term *aryan* and if you think about it, from his point of view, he didn't choose it, so much as he was simply recounting what he viewed to be the immutable truth. We can surmise, however, that he chose it because of the contemporary belief that this group was a ruling caste in the most ancient of the greater civilizations (again in Gobineau's view). That, combined with the linguistic relation (German really *is* an Indo-European language, what is usually referred to in German as *Indogermanisch*) between the ancient Aryans and modern Europeans, appears to have been enough. \n\nFrom Gobineau, this concept of an Aryan master race is usually said to have been transmitted by the British-born German philosopher Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who also happened to be the son-in-law of noted anti-semite Richard Wagner (yes the composer). Chamberlain's 1899 work *Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts* (The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century) is one of the seminal works of the *voelkisch* movement in Germany that was so hugely influential in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and which had such an important place in Nazi, and especially SS, ideology. \n\nFor what it's worth, the Nazis did use the terms *Nordic* and *Germanic* in their ideology. The SS, especially, viewed the Aryan race as having several subgroups, of which the Nordics were seen as being the most pure (way up there in Scandinavia where its cold and mongrels don't bother you - I'm serious, this was the basic idea). Other groups included the Alpine race and the Swabian race. I'm certain there were other subgroups (about a half dozen, iirc), but I can't recall them off the top of my head.   \n\nGermanic, on the other hand, was more of a super-national category that encompassed all \"Aryan\" peoples, so Germans proper, the Danes, Dutch, Flemish, Walloons (after about '42), Norwegians, Swedes, and some lucky folks in Eastern Europe if they had the right qualities about them. \n\nMost of this is taken from George Mosse's *The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich*. It's an older work, but it covers this material pretty well. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I can't say whether this is why the Nazis chose it, but I think *Aryan* is a concept with far more history and potency than any of the alternatives.\n\nThe word *Arya* appears in the *Rig Veda*, an ancient Sanskrit text, and is the root of the name of Iran. Very early on, historical linguists inferred that this meant that the ancestors of the Iranians and the Vedic cultures of northern India referred to themselves as the Aryans. They then (wrongly) associated it with *\u00c9ire* (Ireland in Irish), giving rise to the idea that the progenitors of the entire Indo-European language tree also called themselves Aryans. Already then it has the cachet of being an authentic symbol straight out of the distant past, kind of like the swastika, which terms like Nordic or Germanic don't have. Even I sometimes think it's sad that the word Aryan has been so thoroughly polluted, because it is genuinely rare for us to have an idea of what a people who lived so long ago called themselves.\n\nBut more importantly, by the mid-19th century, Aryan became the standard way of referring to the whole Indo-European phenomenon. And by the mid-19th century the Indo-European phenomenon was taking on increasing significance. This is a time when romantic nationalists\u2015particularly influential in Germany in the form of *v\u00f6lkisch* movement\u2015were looking for the roots of ethnicity in the deep past through comparative philology and folklore studies. For them the Aryans were the deepest of the deep, the ancestors of half of the world. As a result, reconstructing the Aryan language and Aryan mythology stopped being an obscure orientalist pursuit and become the hottest topic in European linguistics, folklore studies and archaeology.\n\nThis was also a time when people needed new narratives about human prehistory. Now that people understood the antiquity of the earth and of the human species (Neanderthals were discovered in 1856, and three years later Darwin published *On the Origins of Species*), the old, biblical accounts of Noah and the Hamites and the Japhetites and what have you weren't going to cut it. The newly burgeoning fields of racial classification and social evolutionism offered a partial framework, but they didn't do much to illuminate *national* histories. Historical linguistics filled the gap. By equating language families with races, you could tell very neat stories about the origins of the world's major ethnic groups, combining the familiar genealogical storytelling of the old biblical scheme with cutting-edge racist ethnonationalism. Towards the end of the century, archaeology was also pressed into service by finding material \"cultures\" that could be matched up to a race and a language. And again, at the very base of all this were the Aryans: the ancestors of nearly everyone from Ireland to India.\n\nThe sheer size of the distribution of Indo-European languages started to push towards the Aryans towards mythical status. The only explanations people had for the spread of languages at the time was migration and conquest. If the Aryans had managed to subdue such a large area, they must have been something, right? For a long time people had assumed that the Aryan homeland was somewhere near India, because that's where the oldest examples of Indo-European languages were. But by the latter part of the 19th century the idea that Asians had conquered half the world (and Europe!) seemed absurd. So people started looking for it elsewhere. Europe, obviously \u2013 but where exactly? Racial theorists divided Europe into a number of sub-races and bickered about which one was the original homeland, and thus the purest descendants of, the Aryans. Unsurprisingly, most Germans favoured the hypothesis that they originated in Northern Europe with the \"Nordic race\". By Hitler's time, this had led to the conflation of the term Aryan with the Nordic race, so that it primarily meant the ancestors of the Germans, with the vague understanding that they had, at some point, gone out an conquered most of the rest of the world.\n\nWith this remarkable story of a single race spreading itself across half the globe firmly established, it's not surprising that the Aryans accumulated fantastical attributes. The Aryans were the smartest, the strongest and the boldest of the races. The Aryans built all the world's great civilizations. The Aryans are the master race. The ruling classes of non-Aryan civilizations were Aryans. The Aryans invented all technology. The Aryans came from Atlantis. They basically became a coatrack for whatever ideas someone had about what made Europeans so great and a way of projecting their pre-eminence right back to the beginning of human history.\n\nSo I think by the 1930s the word Aryan was imbued with far, far more cultural meaning than the proliferation of scientistic racial terminology like \"Nordic\", \"Caucasian\", \"Xanthochroic\" etc. It will have been a word almost everybody would have heard of, and one which didn't just denote just another racial group, but evoked an image of a heroic, superior race from the distant past \u2013 the progenitors of white European civilization. And in Germany in particular it was intimately linked with the *v\u00f6lkisch* movement and the origins of the German people.\n\nI stayed up far too late writing this so apologies if it's lacking in detail. Most of it is based on *Aryan Idols* by Stefan Arvidsson, which is a great book that my drowsy brain hopefully hasn't misrepresented too horrendously.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Well, let me be clear from the outset: the short and simple answer is no, it was not possible in the United States to own a white person as a slave. One of the features that makes slavery in the United States so distinctive and so unique in history is that it was constructed along racial lines; in fact, the very idea of race is so essential to the story of North American slavery that you really can\u2019t separate them out at all.\n\nIt seems easy to imagine that we\u2019ve always had the notion that there are \u2018black people\u2019 and \u2018white people\u2019 as racial identities. Everyone has a skin colour, right? Except before the 16th Century, Europeans really *don\u2019t* have a notion of \u2018race\u2019 like we do today. A white European person from the 15th Century simply would not understand the racial framework we have in western society today. Race is a social construct, a means of categorising people according to a particular physical characteristic; there is no reason why we should have a concept of race and if you were to line everyone in the world up side by side, you simply wouldn\u2019t be able to neatly categorise a vast swathe of people in the middle.\nThe western and particularly North American concept of race is intimately associated with the experience of New World slavery. Whilst it\u2019s wrong to say that we only have a conception of \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 as racial categories because of slavery, you simply cannot unpick one neatly from the other; as slavery develops so too does the American sense of race, and racism.\n\nNew World slavery was a thoroughly, intrinsically racist system \u2013 it was constructed as a system of debasement and exploitation based on the notion that black Africans were inherently inferior and more acutely suited to intense labour than white Europeans. Particularly by the 19th Century in the South, to be black meant to be a slave; to be free was to be white. This is how slaveholding society conceptualised race. There were free black people certainly, but they were an abnormality, an aberration; they existed in a strange world between true freedom (which was the preserve of white people and especially white men) and enslavement. There is a symbiotic relationship between race and slavery in the United States, and many of the racial problems that plague the US today are the direct result of the racial construction of slavery. For that reason, we must be extremely careful about discussing notions of 'white slavery'.\n\nWhat you might have sometimes heard of referred to as \u2018white slavery\u2019 is a practice from the colonial period known as *indentured servitude*. As it was notionally constructed, this was a practice whereby white workers from Europe would agree to sign up to work as labourers in the New World for a fixed term, usually seven years, at the conclusion of which they would be given compensation for their services in the form of either land, cash or both. Essentially, indentured servants would go to the New World \u2013 to places like Barbados or Virginia \u2013 initially as labourers and workers, and at the end of their term of service, become settlers who could forge their own destiny and fortune in the New World.\nNow, despite this theoretically being a free arrangement, a great many of these indentured servants were \u2013 through a variety of means of coercion \u2013 sent to the New World against their will. \n\nLikewise, the conditions of work and life they experienced, particularly in the Caribbean, were far from ideal and were often intense and gruesome. This was certainly no working holiday; mortality rates were high for those workers going to the New World, their rights were certainly restricted and their masters had considerable jurisdiction over them for much of the colonial period. Institutional frameworks sprung up around indentured servitude to help enforce it in law and practice, frameworks which inspire the laws and mechanisms that helped to enforce slavery. So certainly, we can identify similarities with slavery. But this is not a system of slavery per se.\n\nOne of the fundamental differences is that indentured servitude comes with three implicit distinctions: it is intended to be a *temporary* arrangement, it is a contract entered into by two (theoretically) mutually consenting free persons, and the servant is not considered to be the legal property of their master; the servant retains a legal identity as a free person. Contrast that with African slavery. Slaves do not need to even theoretically consent to the arrangement of slavery, it is automatically construed to be servitude until death, and the slave is reduced to property. An indentured servant remains a person in law with rights and dignities \u2013 their employer\u2019s power over them stems not from a condition of ownership, but rather from a contract into which the servant has entered. In slavery, the master\u2019s owner stems from the fact that the slave is legally their property to do more or less with as they please. Furthermore, at least on paper, there is an implied mutually beneficial relationship in indentured servitude: the master gets low-cost labour for the better part of a decade, the servant gets considerable compensation at the end of their service.\n\nNow certainly, abuses were abound in this system. Many servants died from neglect or abuse before they ever came to the end of their service; others had employers who would try to cunningly trap servants into perpetual work by extending the length of their contracts as punishment for infractions against it, or as collateral against loans. We might say that some servants ended up suffering slave-like conditions. But again, we generally stress that this was not really slavery; the construction of the system and the institutional framework that surrounds it is qualitatively and substantially different. Slavery as it came to be practiced in the United States was characterised by a systematic and institutional degradation and dehumanisation of its victims in both practice and theory; they were literally reduced to Human property both legally and in practice. Whilst in some ways servants came to be treated as property, particularly in the British Caribbean, it is recognised that there were limits imposed by cultural and institutional frameworks.\n\nWhere there has been a more genuine and ongoing debate among historians is what the relationship between white indenture and black slavery is. Some conceptualise black slavery as having *begun* as a kind of indentured servitude; others (myself included) insist black slavery was always functionally distinct from white servitude. But in the historiography a distinction is broadly maintained between indentured servants and African slaves; Hilary Beckles conceives indenture as a form of \"proto-slavery\" but stops short of describing it as the same system. And indeed, whichever side you take in that debate, there are points where servitude and slavery exist side by side - and contemporaries certainly make qualitative differences between the two. Indentured servitude has similar features and it helped to shape the development of racial slavery, but it is not inherently the same as the system of racial African slavery (or, for that matter, Native American slavery, which was also practiced). They are related, but distinct, forms of unfree labour.\n\n**Selected sources:**\n\n* Winthrop Jordan, *White over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550 - 1812* (1968).\n* Winthrop Jordan, *The White Man's Burden: Historical Origins of Racism in the United States* (1974) [this is an abridged reconstruction of the above book, more suitable for general readerships]\n* Christopher Tomlins, *Freedom Bound: Law, Labor, and Civic Identity in Colonising English America, 1580 \u2013 1865* (2010).\n* Hilary Beckles, *White Servitude and Black Slavery in Barbados 1627 - 1715* (1990).\n* Hilary Beckles, \"Plantation Production and White \"Proto-Slavery\": White Indentured Servants and the Colonisation of the English West Indies, 1624 - 1645\", *The Americas* 4, no. 3 (1995): 21 - 45.\n* Alden Vaughan, \"The Origins Debate: Slavery and Racism in Seventeenth-Century Virginia\", *The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography* 97, no. 3 (1989): 311 - 354.\n\nEDIT: I am busy tonight.

                "answer": "<p>Ok, this is a huge question about which there have been virtually whole libraries full of books been written. In the following I'll try to give a somewhat simplified and condensed run-down of the \"Jewish Conspirarcy\" trope.\n\nTo completely understand this one, we actually need to start with modernity itself. The Enlightenment and the onslaught of modernity following its earlier thinkers but especially the French Revolution had a profound impact on the thinking of the 19th century. With God being out of the game as the factor upon which the course of history and the legitimacy of power could be rested, discursive pressure formed to find new explanations for why the world was the way it was, why the people in it were different from each other, and what gave political power and order its legitimacy.\n\nTo solve this conundrum, various people formulated different answers. One you might be familiar with was Marxism, in the sense that Marx posed that the underlying force of history was class conflict and the legitimacy of power ultimately derived from the ownership of the means of production (simplified version here). But another and for this question very pertinent answer was also found in Social Darwinism. Social Darwinism wants to apply the concepts of survival of the fittest and natural selection to society and politics. In the age of the rise of nationalism, which saw nations resp. the according races as the actors in the historical process (like Marx viewed classes), the theory of Social Darwinism was combined with the theory of races as the historical actors and created what in essence became the v\u00f6lkisch ideology.\n\nNow where do the Jews fit into and what does this have to do with some sort of alleged conspiracy, you might be asking. Well, in the tradition of v\u00f6lkisch thought as formulated by thinkers such as Gobineau and Houston Steward Chamberlain races as the main historical actors were seen as acting through the nation, the latter being basically their tool or outlet to compete in Social Darwinist competition between them. The Jews thought of as a race had no nation - seen as their own race, which dates back to them being imperial subject and older stereotypes of them as \"the other\" - but were a \"race\" that acted internationally rather than nationally. In order to be able to compete within the racial conflict them having no nation were seen as acting in a conspiratorial manner. Chamberlain e.g. made them out to be the controlling parasites behind political action and order that was seen as anti-national such as the Catholic Church or the Habsburg Empire. The anti-Semitism that formed here in the later stages of the 19th century is in effect a ideology of conspiracy, alleging a Jewish conspiracy in order to weaken their racial competitors.\n\nThe clearest example of such a way of thinking can be found in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a political treatise produced by the Tsarist Secret Police  at some point in 1904/05 that alleges to be the minutes of a meeting of the leaders of the Jewish world conspiracy where they discuss their plans to get rid of all the world's nations and take over the world. Despite these protocols being debunked as a forgery really quick, they had a huge impact on many anti-Semitic and v\u00f6lkisch thinkers in Europe, not at least for some in the Habsburg empire such as J\u00f6rg Lanz von Liebenfels and others which were most likely read by the young Hitler.\n\nThe whole trope of the Jewish conspiracy as formulated by v\u00f6lkisch thought took on a whole new importance with the end of WWI, the Bolshevik revolution, and the subsequent attempts at revolution in Germany and elsewhere.\n\nThe defeat of the Central powers were seen by many of its soldiers and ardent supporters not as a military defeat but as a \"stab in the back\". The way the war ended in Germany with revolts of soldiers and the deposition of the monarchy by Social Democrats was the foundation for this myth that in essence revolved around Germany not being defeated by the Entente but by the enemies within. The trope of the enemy within being Jews and leftists had been brewing for a long time (see the Jew count of the German army in 1916/17) but really came to the forefront with the defeat. What follwed compounded this further. The violence of revolution and counter-revolution as well as the treaty of Versaille lead to many v\u00f6lkisch inclined thinkers and political actors believing that Germany's defeat and the subsequent peace terms could only be explained by a concerted act of the jewish conspiracy leading to internal enemies stabbing Germany in the back, threatening the very German way of life through Bolshevism and preparing the Jewish-Bolshevik takeover of Germany by making it defenseless through the Versaille treaty.\n\nDemocracy seen as faulty and antithetical to the German racial character and communism as an essential anti-national movement were both shunned by these v\u00f6lkisch ideologues and explained through a concerted effort by a conspiracy of the anti-national \"race\", the Jews. This was the very core idea of v\u00f6lkisch thought and of Nazi Weltanschauung. In the end, for Hitler and many of his followers it was the only way to explain the state of the world because it hinged on this Social Darwinist, ultra-nationalist view of history being a history of races competing for power and supremacy.\n\nSources:\n\n* Chrisoph Dieckmann: J\u00fcdischer Bolschewismus 1917 bis 1921.

Your explanatory text also seems to require some information.\n\nYou are correct in asserting that the persecution of the Jews was not just scapegoating. There were a myriad of reasons why each perpetrator of the Holocaust acted. For some it was scapegoating, others it was enrichment through stolen property, while others did have ideological hatred of the Jews.\n\nYou are also right in saying that the Holocaust (meaning the extermination of the Jews) was to remain a secret. As Himmler stated in a speech to SS officers on October 6, 1943, \"It should be discussed among us, and yet, nevertheless, we will never speak about it in public.\" However, the plan to eliminate the Jews from German life was fairly public. It could be clearly seen during the 1930s that Jews were being removed from the public sphere (not geographically at that point). They had been removed from the civil service, lost citizenship rights, etc. It was the END of the Jews in extermination that was \"hidden\" so to speak. Germans across Europe took part in the deportations of the Jews. Germans could see trains of Jews travelling past them. However, the camps themselves were hidden. This allowed Germans to accept that the Jews were being relocated to the East, which was a euphemism used by the Nazis for the Final Solution. However, on the other hand, the Wehrmacht and *Einsatzgruppen* were heavily involved in open air shootings of hundreds of thousands of Jews in the occupied territories of the Soviet Union. It is hard to claim that this was \"secret\".\n\nRegarding the work potential of the Jews, this is a very complicated issue with quite a bit of research.

                "answer": "<p>I love this question, but I only have a preliminary direct answer and then a tangential answer that might interest you. First, in my research I have never found an instance of a historian falling ill (myself or anyone else) from archival work related to disease and medicine. Perhaps it has happened, but I've yet to find it or experience it myself. Though I have admittedly have gotten sick on trips to do research, but never from the archive material itself.\n\nHowever! What you might find interesting---and is related to this question---is what the curator of the Trondheim police museum found around 1998. Tucked away for the past eighty years, had been \"[a glass bottle containing two irregularly shaped sugar lumps](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6687/full/393747a0.html).\" But what alarmed the curator was the attached note: \"A piece of sugar containing anthrax bacilli, found in the luggage of Baron Otto Karl von Rosen, when he was apprehended in Karasjok in January 1917, suspected of espionage and sabotage.\"\n\nWhat you may not know is that *Bacillus anthracis* is of a genus of bacteria that form hardened, long-lived endospores. These structures help them survive conditions that are unfavorable to their growth, like dry seasons for soil bacteria---or in the case of *anthracis*---periods in between infection of various organisms. It is not known precisely how long endospores can last, but it is believed that under favorable conditions they can remain viable indefinitely. Thus the Trondheim museum curator was smart to contact the Norwegian Defence Microbiological Institute after his discovery. They found embedded in one of the sugar cubes a 20mm closed capillary tube, and the tube contained a brown fluid. After securing the bottle in a sterile environment, they proceeded to see if the fuild contained viable spores. From the tube they managed to grow *only* four colonies of bacteria (this is a very small number, suggesting the spores were at the end of their lifespan from the conditions they were recovered). What more, the biologists identified the bacteria as *B. anthracis* through culturing and staining, and on further used molecular techniques to support their identification.\n\nWhat I really like about this story is that I think it's an interesting cross-roads for thinking about how historians can read from the natural histories of (micro)organisms something about the course of human history or science. *B. anthracis* was likely first isolated by the German physician Robert Koch in the 1870s. From the very dawn of bacteriology, its practitioners have been avid collectors and cultivators of bacterial cultures---both benign and deadly. It wasn't until the dawn of the 20th century that institutions arose with various nations with the goals of collecting and standardizing \"type-cultures.\" This---in conjunction with the clinical processes of bacteriology---became the foundation on which we built our modern taxonomy of microbes and is closely related to how our culture deals and thinks about disease and pathogens both then and now. But microbes are strange creatures, and I think that they in turn have been active \"meaning\" makers, and thus can in ways be read as texts themselves.\n\nBut in this case, no one got ill from the *B. anthracis* isolated from the sugar cubes. But we do know that the German state entertained a few **very small** bioweapon attempts at the Allied cavalry (not entirely unlike British large scale planned bioweapon attacks on German cattle and cattle workers). I am doubtful, though, that historians have much to fear from most primary sources---no matter what the pestilent provenance. The vast majority of human pathogens do not survive long outside the body, *B. anthracis* being one of those rare few. But even *B. anthracis*, while it can be weaponized (aerosolized), is not a communicable disease, so we still have little to worry about.\n\n*Death in a Small Package: A Short History of Anthrax* by Susan D. Jones is a really good book about the natural and human history of Anthrax---the diseases and the microbe. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Hi! I'm a reference archivist, with training in the preservation of documents. We get this question, sometimes, and the answer is fairly complicated. It really depends on the pathogen. The most common pathogen in an archive is mold, which could infect and live on old paper, and cause damage to it -- as well as, potentially, make someone sick. A lot of resources on mold can be found [here](http://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/archives-and-mold.html) at the National Archives' website.\n\nBasically, and using [this](https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation) as my source, pathogens are likely to be inert -- including mold. Archives have to keep conditions cool and dry to preserve paper; the institution I work at typically has around 65 degrees Fahrenheit and around 40% relative humidity.\n\nThis isn't an ideal environment for mold and many pathogens in the stacks; the mold spores that could be hiding on a document are inert and not infecting other documents or us. That said, if conditions change -- for example, a power outage, or an excessive amount of time in a less environmentally controlled reading room -- the mold (and likely other) spores can become active. We send these in for conservation treatment quickly and we monitor conditions with [data loggers](https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/environmental/pem2-datalogger), which record enormous amounts of data to show the change in conditions.\n\nSo, it's certainly possible to get an infection. I know that when I was hired, I was warned that I could be exposed to (specifically) mold spores as a function of my duties. It isn't, however, terribly likely. Archives aren't the ideal breeding ground for widespread infections. When it happens on an extreme level, the public isn't likely to be involved -- the archival staff will be doing disaster management and taking those materials out of the stacks to quarantine them.\n\nIf you ever see a moldy document, though, please tell your archive's staff! That's a bad thing for the entire archival collection, and not just that document.\n\nAs other commentors noted, you may want to ask science subreddits, too; I can speak about the common infestations, but I certainly am not an epidemiologist! </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Everyone else has talked about the anthrax etc, but you're not out of the woods yet, because germs are not the only thing that can get you sick at the archives! I can walk you through some of the safety precautions I take at work to protect my health. I'm essentially a processing archivist (it's not my title, but I process most of the year). In general though, any material we injest is going to sit in the backlog for too long (read: months if it's an important collection, years if it's not) before an archivist processes it for any sort of common pathogen to survive. \n\nDust, mold, bird droppings, insect droppings, and mouse poop are actually my major workplace health hazards. This is due to how things are stored before they come to the archives, there's no reason for it other than people are gross. I was exposed to mouse droppings this spring processing a collection that was kept in a garage, I actually didn't wear gloves (it's dangerous to wear gloves with fragile paper actually, but that's a story for a different party), but I washed my hands about every 20 minutes. In another collection, I experienced enough dust exposure to have some nasal irritation that lasted a while. This was from a collection that was taken from the house of a hoarder, who I believe also smoked (judging from his habit of using matches as bookmarks), from his basement which was not completely dry, so it was just full of irritants. I have access to face masks but they're a major PITA to wear, so I usually prefer to use a damp cloth to wipe materials (i.e. Book covers, boxes, media casings) periodically to keep the dust down, and take breaks. But I know some archivists who have developed severe sensitivies to mold spores and dust over time working with history, and had to switch jobs. It's just a risk you have to live with if you want the job I suppose. \n\nTo mitigate risks, additionally, high mold content material can be deep-freezed before it is processed, but this doesn't totally reduce your expose to mold (which is still irritating when it's dead), it's mostly to keep it from spreading to your collections. I have processed one collection (also from a hoarder, but a different one! Lotta hoarders in the ivory tower, but once again, story for another party) that had been deep freezed to kill mold before it was processed. I did not experience any noticeable symptoms from it though. \n\nAlso a/v material exposes you to eye/nasal irritants, in particular decomposing acetate \"vinegar syndrome\" film is quite irritating in long patches. [This is pretty well known and something any competent manager or archivist will look out for.](http://www.nfsa.gov.au/preservation/glossary/vinegar-syndrome) Ideally it should be handled under a fume hood, but if I ever work in an archives with a fume hood... I had a part-time student working with film for a little longer than I was comfortable with, and I had to keep reminding her to take breaks. \n\nAnyway, don't be scared off from coming to visit, because patrons (aka historians) are going to be working with cleaned, processed collections, and you probably face more health risks from checking out a DVD from the public library. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I've answered this before, copied here for you: \n\nThis is a very complex question so I am going to narrow it down to focus just on Europe. Furthermore, I am going to focus largely on England, though many of the things I say below apply also to France, the Netherlands and some of the German Kingdoms/territories. \n\nThe short answer is between the mid-seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (1650-1700). \n\nThe idea that women were more sexually aggressive seems to be quite an old one, and is related to the (European) idea that a woman's orgasm was necessary for conception. Indeed, the very misogynistic rationalization of the idea was, essentially \"all human sin derived ultimately from the original weakness of Eve, the first woman, and the pollution of sex was but one manifestation of this.\" Indeed, the very famous diarist, Samuel Pepys, after orgasming with an illicit lover was terrified that he might have made her orgasm as well....until her tone of voice assured him she had not (heh).\n\nAnother example, and one of the rare surviing female accounts comes from Anna Harrison, a maid, who also saw men on the side to supplement her income. When a man penatrated her she would say:\n\n>Pray, make haste make haste make haste! I am afraid that you should get me with child...no, no I must take care [not to orgasm], 'tis a troublesome thing to have a child and no father who owns it.\n\nThough, of course, the historical record contemporary opinions about sexual desire is overwhelmingly male, a large part of the surviving record expresses a sort of fear/repulsion of women and their sexual desire. One such example is Nashe's [*A Choice of Valentines* aka *Nashe's Dildoe*](http://allpoetry.com/The-Choice-of-Valentines)\n\nThe poem, of course describes a man who goes to see a woman he loves in a brothel and pays a heavy price to see her, whereupon he prematurely ejaculates. The woman manages to coax him 'back to life,' and appears to climax with him, but comments that she is unsatisfied, using a dildo to satisfy herself. The poem finishes with a long description of this dildo, full of anxiety, repulsion and attraction\u2014the woman has replaced him in the most primal sense:\n\n\n>My little dildoe shall supply your kind,\t\nA youth that is as light as leaves in wind:\t\nHe bendeth not, nor foldeth any deal,\t        \nBut stands as stiff as he were made of steel;\t\n(And plays at peacock twixt my legs right blithe\t\nAnd doeth my tickling swage with many a sigh;)\t\nAnd when I will, he doth refresh me well,\t\nAnd never makes my tender belly swell.\u201d\t        \nPoor Priapus **[penis]**, thy kingdom needs must fall,\t\nExcept thou thrust thus weakling to the wall;\t\nBehold how he usurps in bed and bower,\n\n\n>...\n\n\n>(Curse Eunuch dildo, senseless counterfeit,\t\n\n\n>Who sooth may fill, but never can beget...\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe biggest reason the shift happened was, as Thomas Laqueur argues (and I agree), in the mid-1600s and through the 1700s there was a shift in thinking about gender. Before the Enlightenment, men and women were seen as two sides of one sex--it was generally held that both genders had the same anatomical make up. It was believed that a man could 'revert' or descend to being a woman if he was too feminine, and that a woman could become manly and grow a penis. There was a great fear among moralists of these 'hermaphrodittii'. (And, for this reason there were many laws in European countries against a man or a woman wearing the clothes of the opposite gender). Laqueur cites many reasons for the shift, including a formalizing medical field, cultural and societal shifts:\n\n>the rise of evangelical religion, Enlightenment political theory, the development of new sorts of public spaces, Lockean ideas of marriage as a contract, the cataclysmic possibilities of social change wrought by the french revolution, post-revolutionary conservatism, post-revolutionary feminism [and so on].\n\nAfter the mid-1700s, the emphasis on physical differences became more pronounced than the idea that there were essentially only one sex. \n\nCoupling these shifts was the rise of the libertine, or libertinism in England and France. These libertines were often very young and sexually aggressive males who lived in a society that trivalized sexual violence against females. Here's Pepys again, talking about the wife of one of his servants:\n\n>Tuesday 15 November 1664:  I to the \u2018Change, and thence Bagwell\u2019s wife with much ado followed me through Moorfields to a blind alehouse, and there I did caress her and eat and drink, and many hard looks and sooth the poor wretch did give me, and I think verily was troubled at what I did, but at last after many protestings by degrees I did arrive at what I would, with great pleasure\n\n>Tuesday 20 December 1664: After dinner I found occasion of sending him [my servant] abroad, and then alone \u2018avec elle\nMrs Bagwell je tentais a faire ce que je voudrais et contre sa force je le faisais biens que passe a mon contentment\u2019 [Alone with her I attempted to do that which I wanted, and against her resistance I achieved it: It went well, to my content.]\n\nAnd there are several more incidents. Though rape was a capital offence, many women would not report or admit what had happened, for fear of being tainted with the onus of a defiled woman, or even being accused of being the initiator. \n\nSeveral reform societies, the most influential of which was the Society for the Reformation of Manners succeeded in pushing this cultural shift into gradual acceptance by targeting libertinism and the men who visited prostitutes. This, more than anything else, helped convince the general public that men, not women were the sexual aggressors.\n\nSo the longer answer is that, between 1650 and the early 1700s, a shift in how Europeans looked at gender occurred, caused by many reasons. At the same time, the philosophy of libertinism and encouragement of male sexual rapacity developed, especially among upper-class men. These two developments were targeted by moral reform societies that articulated a belief that the devil was channeled through men, not women. It was no longer believed that Eve brought sexual pollution into the world. \n\n*Sources*\n\nNashe's Dildo: http://www.bartleby.com/334/90.html\n\nPepys' Diary: http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/12/\n\nThe Origins of Sex, Faramerz Dabhoiwalla\n\nAristotles Master-Piece\n\nMaking Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud - Thomas Laqueur</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The notion of the \"temptress\" you are speaking about here would reflect the influence of St. Augustine on the understanding of sexuality after the fall of Rome.  St. Augustine articulated a Platonic notion of body and mind as separate and asserted that Adam and Eve were 'creatures of the mind' who were subsequently corrupted by lust (also then connecting to the emerging idea of original sin--here connected with the sin of lust associated with women through Eve).  A series of laws instituted through out Europe (most notably the Discipline Ordinance of 1537) in the wake of the Reformation codified the connection between female sexuality, lust, and temptation; the specific case of the Discipline conflated female sexuality and prostitution as a social (and moral) danger to western society.  \n\nThe most apparent change to this sexual regime was in the Victorian age (using Victorian to speak of the broad sexual culture in the Foucaudian sense), when the concept of sexual/ gendered separate sphere was linked with a notion of propriety for women and a naturalist notion of sexuality for men.  There were, of course, still prostitutes but the conflation between them and women in general was tempered in this period.  Sexuality was used as a method of defining social class in Europe during the 19th century, thus a new conceptualization of femininity (as middle class) emerged in line with notion of masculinity as more sexualized.  Women were understood as moral creatures in contrast and this morality was defined through sexual control.    \n\nIn many manner manuals published in this period, middle-class women were often not told anything about sex, again reinforcing a new stereotype.  It is of course important to note that these stereotypes did not necessarily match the sexual reality in Europe (and the United States) in the 19th century, but they come into prominence during this period.\n\nSources: Lyndal Roper, The Holy Family\n\nRobert Nye, Sexuality\n\nMichel Foucault, History of Sexuality (vol. 1)\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Interesting question! I did a lot of my studies about British India at Oxford, and I always found reminders that the University was at one point the nursery for Britain's imperial missionaries. If you go to what was, when I was a student, the History Faculty Library, you will see its tower adorned with a weather vane in the shape of an elephant; it was once the Indian Institute building, dedicated to scholarship of Britain's most important territory, the arch-legitimizer of its imperial mission.\n\nDo you mind if I don't firstly suppose you're the son of an Indian prince? Let's imagine instead you're a woman, a Christian, the daughter of a Parsi Anglican Reverend, born in Pune (\"Poona\"); let's imagine you're Cornelia Sorabji, the first female graduate of an Indian university, and you came to England to attend Oxford University to read for the Bachelor of Civil Laws exam. You are not just the first Indian woman to do this, you are the first woman ever to take the exam. Cornelia went up to Somerville (a woman's college), and became not just a tutee but a real prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Oxford tutor Benjamin Jowett, a larger-than-life figure whose fame at Balliol was great indeed. She was introduced to Jowett by Agnes Maitland, then Principal of Somerville, and was invited to dine at Balliol's High Table by him - being a gentleman's college, she had to be chaperoned by Miss Maitland (one of the principal's jobs at a women's college was to act as a chaperone in all manner of social engagements - even visiting the dentist).\n\nIn England, Cornelia always wore a sari, even though as a child she wore Western garb in Poona. Jowett, who to many students was an intimidating figure, took the unintimidated Cornelia under his wing and through him she met many important Victorians, including Florence Nightingale. Jowett created a special course in law for her, since she was originally at Oxford to read for English. Cornelia's social life in Oxford seems to have been one of relative privilege compared to many students - her case was rather a famous one, for she found entry to Oxford difficult - but she does not record difficulties finding a social life or taking exams because she was an Indian. Granted, she was a Christian, with a glass-cut English Establishment RP accent, but she was dark-skinned. Instead, her obstacles, mostly institutional, given that formats did not then exist for her to do many of the things she ended up doing, seem to have been because she was a woman.\n\nIf you want a nice, approachable touch of personal history to deal with this, please see the talk given by Professor Richard Sorabji (yes, tellingly of the same name) back in 2010 when I was there that Oxford helpfully hosts here: http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/cornelia-sorabji-jowetts-prot-g-e-oxford-1889-1893\n\nNow let's think about the aristocratic dimension to the question. For this, I think a really interesting work would be David Cannadine's book, *Ornamentalism*, the title of which is obvious reference to Said's *Orientalism*. Said outlined the institutional racism of imperialism, in which the West's imagination of the East served as much to make concrete a subservient relationship as did the practical deficits created within the relationship. Cannadine argues a modification of this, pointing out ways in which race was a much less important element to the way Britain related to India (and other parts of its empire) than, say, class, rank, or social status. Cornelia's case seems to help this case.\n\nSpecific examples illustrating this case come if we look at how the British behaved in India. If we take the example of Viceroy the Marquess Curzon, we see the patriarch one of the most ancient aristocratic familes in Britain becoming a government-appointed king of India, residing in a palace that was modelled *on the very house he was born in*. (See: [Kedleston](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2459/3757515886_2e6bf53428_z.jpg) provided the architectural inspiration for [Government House](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Rajbahavan.jpg) in Calcutta) If we examine Curzon's social habits, we know that his preference was to spend time amongst Indian aristocracy if his other choice was middle class Britons. He would regularly attend princes' estates to go hunting; we can see him [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Lord_Curzon_Hunting_1901.jpg) proudly posing with the Maharajah of Gwalior. He found commoners, frankly, annoying; they were interested in money, and imagined themselves superior to all Indians purely on the basis of being British. He found them smallminded and petty social climbers, who sought his favour for their own elevation; he thought the elevated social status of British commoners in India artificial, and detested going to Simla (the place of summer government, when it was too hot in Calcutta) because he was trapped there with cricket-playing middle class British busybodies. Curzon was raised believing his blood made him the inheritor of natural superiority; this is something he had in common with the Maharajah, and something that distanced him from many of his fellow Britons in India. Part of people like Curzon's imperial mission was to export the social order that they saw as existing at home. When the Hawaiian King Kalakaua (thank you /u/bigjameslade for this correction of nationality and providing the name) was seated in higher order than the Crown Prince of Germany at a royal banquet, then-prince Edward (Edward VII) riposted to a complaint, \"Either the brute is a king, or else he is an ordinary black nigger, and if he is not a king, then why is he here?\" This is so obviously a backhandedly racist comment, but it crystallizes for me in a really nice way the dichotomy in the mindset of imperialists what the world order was. White people were superior, yes, but a black king was superior to a white prince. Here, Edward would have probably found disagreement from many who were not aristocrats in Britain.\n\nSo: this is not to say racism did not exist, or to say that Curzon did not believe the British were superior to Indians. It is to say, however, that the imperial relationship is extremely complex, with many layers interacting at many different levels. Social strata overlapping and intermingling make it difficult to extract an answer to your question. A shopkeeper might have refused to serve the son of an Indian prince whilst he studied at Oxford (I actually doubt this, but let's imagine a case of everyday prejudice) but meanwhile he would be invited to high table, to visit English country houses on the weekends, and enjoy all the privileges of a gentleman scholar, far beyond the aspirations of your average Oxford commoner, be he English or Welsh(!) or Indian (commoner is a class of student at Oxford - in former times, an aristocrat could purchase a scholarship that accorded benefits). Indeed, many Indians of common (non-noble) status studied in England to take the exam for the Indian Civil Service, and it might be there that you'd be able to get a more straightforward example about racial discrimination.\n\nFurther listening, please have a look at Oxford's \"Indian Traces in Oxford\" series of recordings, which have a selection of Indian experiences at the University: https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/indian-traces-oxford</p>",

                "answer": "<p>To be sure, the answer to this question would be mostly speculation because the historical record is woefully lacking in primary sources which relate to this topic.  In addition, primary sources related to this topic do not explicitly say that the Mongols understood the historical significance of the cities you mentioned.\n\nSomething we all need to be aware of is the Mongols world view.  The Mongols understood the world in their terms.  They felt that everyone should be semi-nomads, living in *gers*, foraging, raising livestock, and riding horses.  This is much of the reason that the forces of Genghis Khan destroyed irrigation, farmland, and buildings during their early conquest.  It is very likely that the Mongols knew about the West, they certainly did during the later years of the various nation-states.  As far as taking these cities for a strategic advantage is concerned, yes.  The Mongols would have taken these cities if there was a strategic advantage.  It is not likely that they would have taken them with prior knowledge regarding their importance.\n\nWhat I can tell is that the Mongols did have connections to the West, which I'm sure you already knew.  Several famous chroniclers traveled to Mongolia, including William of Rubrick, John Plano de Carpini, Juviani, and others.  \n\nWe do know that the West had very limited knowledge of the Mongols before the thirteenth century.  David Morgan argues that Genghis Khan's conquest of Central Asia and China went mostly unnoticed.  He also argues that the first person to travel to Mongolia and return with accurate information was Friar Julian of Hungary in 1234.  The invasion of Kievan Rus' lands, undertaken by Batu and the Golden Horde (this is the collective name), alerted Europe to the oncoming threat.\n\nThe Ilkhans under H\u00fcleg\u00fc, brother of Mongk\u00eb Khan, had interactions with the Papacy and the Crusaders.  In 1260, the Ilkhans found themselves facing intense pressure from the Mamluks in Egypt, to the West, and their kin, the Golden Horde, to the North.  \n\nDavid Morgan states:\n\n>the Ilkahns of Persia....speedily dropped their old hauteur and began to see the Christian powers as potentially useful allies.  The basic idea behind such projects for alliance was a combined operation against the Mamluks:  a crusading force would be sent from Europe and its activities would be co-ordinated with an Ilkahnid invasion of Syria.  Should Syria be conquered by the allies, the Crusaders would again take possession of Jerusalem.  \n\nNegotiations went back and forth between the two, but ultimately, little came from the agreement.  The Ilkhans were pushed back by the Mamluks, and someone specializing in the Crusades will have to take up the European story from here.  This is one example of a clash that involved one of the cities you mentioned.  I would argue that explicit plans to take one of those cities as a gateway to the West were not in place during the reign of the Mongols.  Strategic plans for taking those cities as a strategy to subjugate the West may have existed.\n\nAll of the places you've mentioned were historically important, but did the Mongols understand this?  We simply don't know.  We can certainly imply and suggest that they were not aware of the historical importance of these cities in religious or geopolitical terms.  \n\nI hope this is of some use to you and all those reading.\n\n**Suggested Readings:**\n\nDavid Morgan's *The Mongols*, 1986.\n\nJ.

The mongols, as I said, were after wealth, not religious symbols. Rome and constantinople would have been of interest. Any hopes for constantinople was pretty much destroyed when the turks in anatolia successfully broke off the mongol empire and created the ottoman empire ( who themselves would go on to conquer constantinople ). As for rome, the roman leadership ( the papacy and the business elite ) were more than willing to cooperate with/submit to the mongols and as a result was given preferential trade opportunities and favors within the mongol empire and as a result the italians grew extremely rich which in turn set the stage for the italian renaissance. The relationship between the italians and mongols were so fruitful that the italians started to name their children after the mongol rulers such as Hulagu Khan, who was a nestorian christian. \n\n\n\n\"The Story of the Mongols: Whom We Call the Tartars\" : Fr.

The low countries' ports are dangerously close to the center of British commerce located in London and the Thames estuaries, allowing them easy access to raid Britain's trade. Furthermore, while England's coast facing France are full of cliffs and other high places providing natural defensive advantage, the east of England facing the low countries, particularly the area around Essex are flat, thus far easier to attack. Various river systems and estuaries runs through the low countries into the north sea which meant that enemy transport ships can shelter in those places relatively safe from Royal Navy in preparation for a rapid attack on Britain itself. Possessions of the low countries particularly by France also negates the Royal Navy's strategy of guarding western approaches to counter French fleet sailing out of Brest. Finally, the shipyards of Antwerp and Flushing are also capable of building additional ships to attack Britain with, providing another incentive to keep it out of French hands.\n\nSource: History of the Royal Navy, A: The Napoleonic Wars By Martin Robson</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As a Dutch student interested in \"our\" history, I would like to try and answer this question.\n\nLet me start off with saying that the most important aspects of this are naval supremacy and trade. Militarily the possession of the Low Countries would not have been too much of a problem for Great Britain.\n\nSince the Dutch Republic had revolted against Habsburg rule in the late 16th century, they had quickly become one of (if not the) the richest nations in Europe, the world's financial and trade capital, and the world's foremost naval power during the 17th century. Especially the latter was of major concern to the English (who had not yet unified with Scotland and Ireland at this point). During the course of the 17th century multiple Anglo-Dutch Trade Wars were fought, in particular after the passing of the Navigation Act. Although the Dutch were victorious in all these 17th century conflicts, the power balance had started to shift in the 18th century. Dutch naval supremacy ended, and that position became vacant during most of the 18th century, with France, Great Britain/England, the Netherlands and to a rapidly decreasing extent the Spanish and Portuguese competing for this position. By the end of the 18th century, this was first and foremost between France and Britain.\n\nNow, Amsterdam did remain Europe's foremost financial and trade centre throughout most of the 18th century. However, as was the case with their maritime power, Paris and London started catching up, and by the turn of the 19th century especially the London Stock Exchange succeeded Amsterdam as leading financial capital.\n\nIf you sum these development up, you see that the Dutch were not too much of a problem for the British anymore on their own. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in the 1780s was essentially an easy win for the British agaist the Republic (the latter being diplomatically supported by France). However, *and this is the key to the answer on your question*, a combination of Dutch and French (+ allies, most importantly Spain) fleets and ship production could be a major threat to British naval power. And, as was and is traditionally the case for Britain, naval power was absolutely quintessential in the British geopolitical defence strategy.\n\nHowever, the Dutch fleet got defeated separately in 1797, and Napoleon's naval ambitions were definitely crushed after Horatio Nelson's famous victory over a combined French-Spanish fleet at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. After these two maritime disasters for Napoleon, British naval supremacy was a definite given all the way until World War II.\n\nTradewise the story is more or less the same: with the addition of the Low Countries to the Continental System fears (or hopes, depending on which side you were on) were that British commerce would be hurt severely by being denied access to the by then moderately powerful but still very wealthy traders in the Low Countries. But also here the Low Countries were not as important as they had historically been, and the British were not hurt too much by this trade blockade.\n\nIn summary: Britain was indeed (very) weary of the acquiry of the Low Countries by the French given the former's historical naval and trade power. However, their power had been waning since the early 1700s, and the Dutch defeat at the Battle of Camperdown before Napoleon's final and definite naval defeat at Trafalgar meant that the majority of this threat had ultimately completely vanished.\n\n--\nI would recommend reading up on the Anglo-Dutch trade wars if you are interested in the topic of the Dutch geopolitical situation. Especially the Third Anglo-Dutch War is an interesting historical event if you ask me.\n\nMartin Robson wrote a good book (A History of the Royal Navy: The Napoleonic Wars) in which the naval side of what I argue would be the answer can be found. I have to admit most of my knowledge on the Dutch 18th century comes from Dutch books unfortunately, and I have not yet found their translations online. I will give it a try later today.\n\nRegardless, I find your side question about the Dutch geopolitical situation interesting and I actually cannot say for sure what the answer would be. I hope to see this further on in the comments.\n\nI hope to have answered your question a bit!\n\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The Low Countries remained a potent threat to Great Britain from the 1700s to the 1900s, due primarily to geography. British naval bases were typically positioned to meet the threat from the enemy of the day; for much of the 1700s and 1800s, this was France, while moving into the 20th Century, Germany became more prominent. Naval bases to meet the threat from France were placed along the British south coast, at Portsmouth and Plymouth. They could threaten any attempt by the French to gain control of the English Channel, and prevent French ships from their bases along the Bay of Biscay moving into the area. As Germany became a bigger threat, the primary bases for the Royal Navy move northwards, to Scotland. From here, the RN could control the North Sea, preventing the Germans making any threatening move towards the UK. However, this positioning left much of the British east coast uncovered by Royal Navy bases. This was exacerbated in the age of sail, when prevailing winds could pin British ships from Portsmouth and Plymouth in the Channel, while allowing an enemy to sail across to the east coast. In the 20th Century, the east coast was a vital shipping route. Ships that had crossed the Atlantic (or from the rest of the world) would moor at the major west coast ports, where their cargoes would be cross-loaded into smaller coasters for shipment to the east coast. This was a particularly vital lifeline for London. Any threat to this shipping was an existential threat to the UK. \n\nThe Low Countries have several excellent ports, at Rotterdam, Antwerp, Bruges and Ostend. Ships operating from these bases were excellently positioned to strike at the British east coast, and at the shipping lanes along it. As such, it was always a major priority of the Admiralty to ensure that these ports were always under the control of a power that was friendly (or neutral) to Britain. This included sending the Royal Naval Division to Antwerp when it became threatened in 1914. When much of Belgium fell under German control in 1914, the RN made multiple efforts to neutralise the German-held ports of Zeebrugge, Bruges and Ostend. Minelaying and bombardment operations were carried out throughout the period. The British Army carried out several offensives to attempt to capture the ports. There were several plans for amphibious attacks to capture the ports, with [Operation Hush](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/4hz4l4/bacons_folly_the_cancelled_1917_great_landing_in/) the closest to being carried out. In April and May 1918, the RN carried out several amphibious raids on Zeebrugge and Ostend, aiming to render them useless to the Germans. These raids did manage to sink blockships in the canals leading inland, but the ships were sunk in the wrong places to effectively block the ports, and they were soon usable. In the Second World War, the Low Countries still represented a naval threat, but the threat from German-held France was judged to be more serious; the Luftwaffe could threaten British air superiority over the Channel, but couldn't effectively reach the East Coast. \n\n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>So OP, if you've read Sorensen, you know he says two things that are directly relevant to your question. First, basically all our written evidence comes from the thirteenth century, after Christianization. In fact, the Icelandic *Homily Book* and the penitentials (lists of sins and prescribed penances) that come down very harshly on homosexual behavior altogether, in exactly the same way it is being condemned in continental pastoral sources at the same time, predate the sagas. Then there is some interesting linguistic evidence from the Gulathing Law, which is a bit older probably still post-dates Christianization in its first transcription.\n\nSecond, Sorensen responds to your point--for thirteenth-century, Christian Iceland--directly:\n\n> One of the questions that will be raised in what follows is the extent to which it was only the passive role that was contemptible; or whether homosexuality as such was condemned, in accordance with Christian moral teaching. It can be said at once that the answer is both/and...The active part must also have been condemned, not only from a Christian point of view. (27-28)\n\nI don't think it's possible to give a definitive answer about pre-Christian Norse society based on the later evidence. However, comparing standard medieval Christian teaching (as expressed in the *Homily Book* and \"Bishop Thorlack's\" penitential from the late 12C) to the secular law and saga evidence can give us an idea of what we might call the *extra-Christian*, if not pre-Christian, culture of high medieval Iceland.\n\nIn the penitential, the very first of the \"cardinal sins\" listed is the sin against nature. It prescribes 9 or 10 years of penance for men who commit illicit sex (the word is adultery) with other men, or with four-footed animals. As John Boswell points out, this penance is exactly the same prescribed for men who rape women. One of the *Homily Book*'s sermons agrees, cagily referring to \"those appalling secret sins perpetrated by men who respect men no more than women, or four-footed animals.\"\n\nThis is solid high/late medieval Christian teaching. Any non-procreative sex act is \"against nature,\" with sodomy and bestiality accounted the worst. All parties involved are to blame (it was common practice into the early modern era to also slaughter the animal--including, by the way, in colonial America). The emphasis, basically, is on sex.\n\nWhereas Christian theologians tried desperately to talk *around* sodomy, Old Norse gives us several words that circle around a semantic field of male-male sexual behavior. I want to talk especially about *argr* or *ragr*.  Its primary meaning is \"cowardly, unmanly, effeminate, with regard to morals or character\" (Sorensen 20). A secondary meaning is, essentially, a man who is inclined to take the passive role in sex with other man. \n\nSo you can see a couple of things. First of all, that being the receiving partner in a male-male sexual encounter is considered *the height of* unmanliness. It is the same word as \"effeminate;\" it's equated with cowardice. There's no question that there was a massive stigma attached to that status; that this was a phrase slung at people rather than claimed proudly or even used neutrally. But what kind of stigma? The application of the feminine form, *org*, to women can start to clue us in. Rather than referring to lesbianism, or to having PIV sex with a man, it's roughly equivalent to modern \"slutty\"--including the derogatory nature. We're dealing with violations of muscular masculinity and chaste femininity, of course, but at the same time--and inseparable from the gender roles--these acts are violations of fundamental personal honor.\n\nThe transgression of masculinity and of honor comes across quite strongly in the legal texts. The Gulathing Law, which has its roots in Norway before Iceland, links three offenses:\n\n> One is if a man says to another that he has given birth to a child. A second is if a man says of another that he was demonstrably [f--ed] by another man. The third is if he compares him to a mare, or calls him a bitch or a harlot, or compares him with the female of any kind of animal.\n\nCouched between the two very clear insults of effeminacy by proxy, the implication of being the receiving partner in homosexual male sex is that it turns the man into a woman from the viewpoint of social standards. It is a violation of gender roles. This is rather different than the Christian theological view that hinges on procreation. \n\nHigh medieval Icelanders, therefore, placed a premium on the sharply delineated gender roles and morals of their society. Mark Jordan points out that on the European continent, the rise of concern over sodomy from the eleventh century comes out of the need to impose social order, especially through marriage. So when Sorensen talks about how strictly gendered Icelandic society was and Au\u00f0ur Magnusdottir emphasizes the importance of marriage as a political act, it seems that disgust with the passive partner in male homosexual behavior involves his perceived threat to social order. \n\nSo all this seems to point to a lack of concern for the \"active\" man in the partnership. Well, as quoted above, Sorensen says not so fast, and I'm inclined to agree. \n\nYou'll notice that this passage doesn't actually involve a sex act at all! (In fact, it's rare to see persecution for actual sodomy acts before the late Middle Ages on the continent, even). Rather, it describes the *accusation* against someone else. The word I translated above as f--ed is sor\u00f0inn (or sannsor\u00f0inn), but there is another less coarse and more complex ring of words based on *ni\u00f0*. ni\u00f0 can mean degrading slander, although, with the close relationship of gender and honor in Icelandic society, there is usually a connotation of sexual depravity involved in the accusation. In the sagas, ni\u00f0 can be a threat as well as an action; it can be physical (erecting a monument to a man's unmasculine behavior, especially cowardice) as well as verbal. \n\nAnd, in the thirteenth century law codes, ni\u00f0 can be a crime. If it explicitly involves the words *argr* or *sor\u00f0inn*, the slandered man has the right to kill his slanderer in retaliation. It is, the laws clarify, exactly the way a man has the right to kill on behalf of a female relative whose honor has been violated.\n\nThe point here is that violating someone's honor is a despicable offense--meriting a fine, meriting outlawry, meriting a duel, meriting the death penalty. True, the laws concern verbal or monumental accusations. But as we saw earlier, to be the more passive partner in a male homosexual encounter was to have one's honor as a male violated. Thus, to be the more active partner is to violate the other person's honor. This, the laws concerning slander make clear, was utterly unacceptable to medieval Icelanders.\n\nSo it's not a surprise to see, in the sagas, not so judgmental references to castrating one's enemies, or to raping both women and men subjugated in war. The conquered--whether it's an opposing army or your son-in-law's family--already have no honor to violate. But two men in the same village? That was a different story.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n* *The* book here is still Preben Meulengracht Sorensen, *The Unmanly Man: Concepts of Sexual Defamation in Early Norse Society,* trans.

Financial and man power resources at that time went either to the Wunderwaffen or to the front. There were not many people able to train people nor were there many able bodied fighters to be trained.\n\n* The convictions of the political leadership: Hitler believed that if the Germans lost Berlin and the war, they were doomed as a race. He and a lot of people in the political leadership believed that guerilla warfare was not a useful tool because once the war was lost by conventional means, it was lost totally.\n\n* Lack of leadership: With Hitler dead, there was by 1945 no political figure left to rally around. Himmler was not popular enough and everyone else had either been dismissed by Hitler or grown to be highly unpopular like Goering.\n\n* Allied tactics: The total occupation and the way the Allies fought, the German were war weary. There simply was not means to gather resources for guerilla warfare and the population also felt that the way the war ended, it was truly over with total occupation.\n\nAs I mentioned in my answer in the linked thread, the only really dangerous case was the Soucek-R\u00f6ssner conspiracy in Austria but that quickly broke apart over fights who would be the \"F\u00fchrer\".\n\nSources:\n\n* Perry Biddiscombe: The Last Nazis: SS Werewolf Guerrilla Resistance in Europe 1944-1947.

                "answer": "<p>According to Kershaw, by war's end the conflict had depleted the supply of effective manpower, materiel, and morale that would have supported the extension the war past the point of political surrender. The German people barely tolerated the continued conflict (it's actually remarkable that they tolerated it to the point they did) and had themselves been conscripted by the *Reichsgau* to dig trenches and build fortifications for an anticipated defense of the Reich. The *Volkssturm* (the Nazi version of the British Home Guard) had pressed into service nearly every available man who had been found unfit for conscription (too old, too young, injured or otherwise infirm) for anticipated rearguard actions. \n\nThe public's willingness to be conscripted into such bodies had less to do with continued allegiance to the Reich and more to do with widespread angst over the possibility of occupation by the Soviets. Rumors (and truths) of Soviet reprisals for Nazi war crimes had led to panic across the reich, including mass suicides in areas close the the Eastern Front, most famously in Demmin where an estimated 2,500 committed suicide rather than face occupation by the Soviets. Indeed, it was the attitude among most Germans that occupation by the United States was preferable to occupation by the Soviets, and as such resistance to American occupation was sporadic, limited and ineffective. \n\nThere was also *Werwolf*, a planned stay-behind operation meant to commence a distributed, leaderless guerrilla war against an occupying force. The plan failed to advance to the operational stage - a number of weapons caches were buried (though few have been located) and money/equipment allotted, but the operation largely failed to exit the runway. \n\nFun historical sidenote: *Werwolf* was intended to operate similar to what we think of as terror cells today - autonomous, leaderless units planning and conducting missions of assassination and sabotage on an occupying force. As for the Nazi government, Hitler never seriously intended to leave Berlin, even in the event of Soviet occupation - he had always intended the reich to fight to the last, no matter how unrealistic a prospect that might seem to us now. Nevertheless, Goebbels concocted a scheme to worry and distract the Allies: the *Alpenfestung*, or Alpine Fortress, a fictional national redoubt in the mountainous regions of southern Germany and northern Italy where the remnants of the Reich, backed by massive numbers of men and materiel, continued the war against the Allies. It was all a myth. Goebbels used the *Abwehr* to disseminate rumors about the *Alpenfestung* including fake blueprints and vaguely menacing reports of unit readiness within the Redoubt which were leaked to Allied intelligence in order to distract Allied forces as they crossed the Rhine and were forced to choose between a narrow front focused on taking Berlin versus a broad front stretching from northern Germany all the way to the Alps. A broad front would have significantly stretched fighting strength in the final phase of the war and meant huge casualties for the Allies. The distraction almost worked. Huge embarrassment for Allied intelligence.\n\nFrom an operational perspective *Werwolf* failed to achieve its stated ends except in a handful of instances where fanatics and SS hardliners staged individual actions against occupying forces (a handful of assassinations, isolated attacks on troops, usually in the form of traps, bombs etc). *Werwolf* failed in part because it was too little, too late, and it failed to anticipate either the depletion of military materiel and morale or the public will to continue the war that would have sustained a stay-behind operation. *Werwolf* instead served an ancillary purpose by coordinating and facilitating underground escape routes (\"ratlines\") for NSDAP VIPs, a purpose that existed cozily with Operation Paperclip, the post-war Allied effort to expatriate useful human assets (chiefly scientists, engineers and political figures with intelligence to offer) from Germany. \n\nIt's arguable that had the war \"ended\" sooner, with reserves of manpower and materiel more intact, that a stay-behind action would have been of greater effect. Consider the challenges faced by the American army in occupying Iraq after the initial phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The war itself lasted a matter of a few short months, with the resistance to the occupation being the main and most bloody obstacle to the occupying army. This is very much what Werwolf might have looked like (albeit on a much larger and more troublesome scale) had the war ended early enough that there were enough motivated, armed personnel with enough guns, ammo and explosives able to melt back into a motivated, radicalized populace and become a hidden opposing force. The war might have looked a lot different. \n\nEdited for clarity, spelling, punctuation and a minor fact check. </p>",

Sheep were part of their pastoral world, so the raw materials were available.  [Bertram Mitford mentions it specifically here (bottom of 142)](https://books.google.com/books?id=iMQNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA142#v=onepage&q&f=false), although in 1883 the object would more likely be manufactured than truly hand-made.  Among other groups, unless they'd adopted European modes of clothing (usually together with religious profession that aided prosperity via colonial favor), the blanket or fur was still the common thing.  Even among converts, you often found it and still do find it today. Of course, the blanket was a target of derision for colonial governments as something seen at initiation (a marker of \"tribalism\") and something inferior to the adoption of European dress which was therefore uncivilized.  The blanket and skins are both mentioned in connection with Lesotho, at a time when many were changing over to imported clothing, in [this approving piece by James Cassidy, a traveler, published in 1901 (bottom of 472)](https://books.google.com/books?id=SqLQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA472).  It does indicate that the mode of cold weather dress in places that saw snow and had a fair bit of cool weather had been skins or blankets, usually layered.  The alternative, naturally, was to stay inside near the central fire, in dwellings that were very well insulated against extremes.  Little work needed to be done on the land in winter, and only the cattle needed to be taken any distance.\n\nAs to why they tend to be depicted with few clothes, that's harder to substantiate, but it's connected to what sold books and papers--an engraving of a person standing wearing blankets over most of their body wasn't as eye-catching as someone wearing less and in physical action.  Only when clothes clearly become markers of high status do you see cold-weather wear in staged photography or drawings--and then it's usually European, as with late images of Moshoeshoe I of Lesotho, Cetshwayo ka Mpande in exile, and others. Actually, if you can find one of Casalis's sketches of young Moshoeshoe in 1833, he's wearing fairly little; in his late life (1860s), he's always buttoned up in a heavy coat with cloak and his iconic top hat.\n\nFound one specifically about Tswana practice, in some of the colder areas of the Free State, North West, and N. Cape today; [this is p.502 from John Mackenzie's account of his time in the area in the 1860s describing supposedly \"all\" of the regional dress this way, though he notes that some people further north (today Zimbabwe) utilized cotton--but I'm not at all sure how true that is.](https://books.google.com/books?id=D8ooAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA502)  So his recollection, at least, is that the differences are so minor as to be of little note.  We might be surprised at how warm properly treated skins with fur, or layered blankets, can be.\n\nI can probably find more accounts of winter wear, but orthography is so unreliable at times that Google Books is hard to trust.  I'll see what I can dig up in my print matter tomorrow, but everything so far has been a variation of the above.\n\n[edit: fixed grammar, added last two lines, added Mackenzie account, fixed year]</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The enforcement of prohibition on a national scale (as opposed to a statewide level) represented an unprecedented expansion in the federal government's authority. The federal government would have to stop the importation of alcohol (a massive project in and of itself) while also ensuring that its manufacture and sale stopped and stayed that way. This would mean a nation wide policing effort in ensuring that all beer, wine, and spirit producers closed shop and destroyed their leftover stock. Up until this point the federal government had never taken on such a responsibility and it was not clear that the constitution granted the power to do so. \n\nLet me know if I've missed the mark and I shall try to clear up any more questions as best I can.\n\n\nSources:\n\n McGirr, Lisa. *The War on Alcohol: Prohibition and the Rise of the American State.* New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2016.\n\nOkrent, Daniel. *Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.* New York: Scribner, 2010.\n\nEDIT:\nLet's get in to the efforts of the Anti-Saloon League (ASL) and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The Anti-Saloon League, as the name indicates, was initially opposed to the institution that served alcohol rather than alcohol itself. The 19th century saloon was a cesspool of gambling, prostitution, and addiction. Alcohol's direct ties to such a seedy organization helped to perpetuate the idea that alcohol was responsible for societal problems like the spread of venereal disease, loss of family income, and domestic abuse. The WCTU used these points to argue that getting rid of alcohol would lead to a better society.\n\nThese were the two most powerful and influential temperance societies in terms of influencing lawmakers and the voting public to consider the merits of prohibition. This is not to say that they were united in their ideas of how to achieve prohibition. Should they focus on individual pledges of sobriety until there was no one left to drink? Bring up ballot measures at the state and local level? Push for national reform? Many members were outright hostile to a national solution, so they pursued action at the state level. They were quite successful. By 1919, 28 states had some kind of prohibition laws on the books.\n\nThen, in 1913, the constitutional campaign was launched which aimed at adding a prohibition amendment to the constitution. This is a stark departure from the previous efforts at the statewide level, and I would argue, that it is because of the success of the Progressive movement in other areas. The 16th and 17th amendments (both passed in 1913) demonstrated that change could be effected nationally in one fell swoop. Similar hopes were held for a prohibition amendment. If the forces of prohibition could win on a national scale, then all lives (so they argued) would be immediately improved without having the uncertainties and the delays that were related to the state-by-state campaign. It also meant that the Prohibitionists did not have to spend their time and money attempting to convince cities (filled with immigrant, working class wets) to give up an integral part of their leisure culture.\n\nWorld War One made prohibition a reality. As the United States entered the war in 1917 everything was turned over to the war effort. People joined war industries, were expected to scrimp and save their food and ration their other consumable goods so that everything possible could be used to win the war. In such an environment it isn't difficult to see how turning good, bread-making wheat into beer would be seen as a waste of resources and actively damaging the war effort. It also didn't help that most of the companies making the beer bore German names such as Pabst, Busch, and Schlitz. Wartime patriotism fueled the prohibition amendment to success under conditions that were wholly unimaginable before the war began. \n\nIn my earlier comment I made a remark that the 18th amendment \"was crafted\" to address a perceived lack in constitutional authority to regulate alcohol on a federal scale. I was intentionally vague on this point because I felt that it was too difficult to say any one person or organization wrote the amendment. I hope that I have included enough information about the efforts of temperance societies in the 19th, and early 20th centuries to demonstrate that the evolution of their tactics from individual pledges to local and state option laws to full blown prohibition was a factor of their early success and that of the Progressive movement at large.\n\nSources: Same as above, except I have also taken a look at:\n\nRose, Kenneth D. *American Women and the Repeal of Prohibition.* New York: New York University Press, 1996.\n\n</p>",

The answer today is the Interstate Commerce Clause, as it is the basis for the Controlled Substances Act. Whereas the constitutional basis for the Controlled Substances Act is not generally viewed as controversial today, the doctrine expanding the Commerce clause to what it is today didn't exist then.\n\n(To clarify briefly, Congress is a governing body of enumerated powers listed in Article I, Section 8 of the constitution. So if a power listed there does not justify the passage of a law then Congress cannot act.)\n\nWickard v. Filburn 1942, created the ~~\"dormant commerce clause\"~~ cumulative effects doctrine, which allows Congress to regulate even *intra*state commerce if it has a cumulative effect on interstate commerce. The Interstate Commerce Clause was also upheld as the basis of Congress' authority for passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was a major expansion of congressional authority.\n\nPrior to these cases the Interstate Commerce Clause was interpreted as being much more narrowly. In the 1920's it might have seemed that a constitutional amendment was necessary to prohibit a substance outright, even local production which would not enter the stream of interstate commerce. And indeed, it might have been necessary, as the Supreme Court of the time likely would not have upheld it. Doing so would have required the creation of doctrine which didn't develop for more than twenty years after that time.\n\nEdit: Correction. Dormant commerce clause is something else, and is not what I meant to say. Pardon my carelessness.</p>",

I will, therefore, not discuss military tactics, but instead highlight three broader elements that, taken together, sum up Britain's biggest mistake during the war: consistent under-estimation of the gravity of the situation.\n\n1.) Continental politics. It is well-known that France became involved in the American War of Independence out of a desire to challenge British hegemony in the wake of the disastrous Seven Years' War (also known as the French and Indian War in the US). What is less known is that Spain and Holland joined France in a coalition against Britain in order to weaken British power in the Caribbean and potentially extract Britain from Gibraltar. Meanwhile, Britain was also engaged (once again) in land warfare in India against both European and Indian armies. As such, it is more appropriate to view the American War of Independence as a continuation, and escalation, of hostilities started by the Seven Years' War. As a result of this coalition, and opportunism in India, British military resources were required on multiple fronts simultaneously, thus the colonial engagement included a fraction of Britain's actual military power. \n\n2.) Military deployment. I don't want to get into specifics in terms of tactical thinking, however historians are in agreement over the fact that British command in the colonies overestimated the number of loyalists it could depend upon for supplies, manpower, and counter-revolutionary action. Furthermore, historians like Christopher Hibbert note that inter-officer rivalries and disputes over actions, authority, and hierarchy crippled logistical and tactical operations throughout the war. The former is a reflection of Britain's detachment from colonial culture and sentiment throughout the 18th century (a significant problem in the lead-up to the war), whereas the latter represents a long-standing problem with the British officer corps, one that would become the focus of a series of military reforms during the nineteenth century. In short, British command in the colonies did not cooperate on the level required to manage a rebellion, especially in a region of the world as rural and geographically difficult to navigate as the colonies were in the late-eighteenth century.\n\n3.) Domestic support. Typically, the American War of Independence is viewed as a monolithic struggle between American 'patriots' and British 'imperialists.' The reality is far more nuanced. Support for the war in Britain was limited at first, and it became extremely unpopular over the course of the engagement. In fact, historian Stephen Conway asserts that the American War for Independence witnessed the first sustained and large-scale public criticism (at home in Britain) of the use of military force as an instrument of policy in western history. Whether or not this is true is up for debate, but the point remains that popular protests (and political fallout) surrounding the war were quite prevalent. In my opinion, this issue played the largest role in Britain's failure to retain the colonies. Popular and political distaste for the war at home soured British morale, led to stalled and/or delayed logistical and tactical support for operations in the colonies, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 made the the concept of independence a potential reality long before it was clear that the war was lost.\n\nYour latter question, 'could they have won it,' is hypothetical, and is thus impossible to answer with any certainty. Sure, they 'could' have won it, had battles gone their way and public opinion remained positive. The better question, I believe, is 'if they could have won it, would the outcome have been any different?' On this, I would argue that evidence points to 'no.' Popular opinion of the war, particularly with regards to the colonial right to independence, was extremely strong. Furthermore, influential economists (like Adam Smith) and politicians firmly believed that an independent America was of greater financial and strategic benefit to Britain in the long-term. On a side note, the fact that Britain had this revolutionary experience in the Americas, yet continued to escalate colonial obligations in Asia (and later Africa) is a topic that drives a significant amount of imperial historiography.\n\nFor more on this, see:\n\n* Christopher Hibbert, Redcoats and Rebels\n* Stephen Conway, American War of Independence and the British Isles\n* C.A.

Arguably if Howe continued to press the Americans who were effectively trapped the war would've been over after the first major confrontation, however thankfully for Washington a dense fog enabled him to withdraw. \n\nAs well as the Howes been military commanders (William Howe's brother, Admiral Richard Howe was commander of the naval forces) they were also peace commissioners. Instead of utilising the  momentum gained from the Battle of Long Island to destroy the Continental Army they now sought peace from a position of strength. On the 11th of September Admiral Howe met Franklin, John Adams and Edward Rutledge however this largely failed due to the Declaration of Independence and Howe not having the power to negotiate a treaty between the two parties. During this period Washington declared to Congress his strategic intentions which was to be a defensive war which avoided 'general action'. (I believe this policy was the principle reason Britain lost the war as it denied the British what they sought throughout the war from 1777, a decisive battle with the Continental Army.  \n\nThe Americans suffered another major setback on the 16th of November when the British captured Fort Washington, taking nearly 3000 American prisoners in the process. This forced Washington into a full retreat. The prospects for the survival of the Continental Army were further diminished by many militiamen returning home. Once Washington reached Pennsylvania in December his army was around 3,000 men. To make matters even worse the one year enlistments of much of the army was soon over. It seemed Washington's Army and independence for the United States were about to disintegrate. On the 8th of December the British captured Newport, another crucial naval base for the British. On the 18th of December Washington wrote 'I think the game is pretty near up'. \n\nPhiladelphia, the US capital seemed to be ripe for the taking. However, Howe chose to quarter his troops throughout the winter. This meant Howe threw away an opportunity to further diminish American morale and perhaps ultimately destroy the rebellion. \n\nWashington's army, down but not out was able to regroup and was reinforced by local militia. Washington wanted to end the military campaign on a positive note before quartering for winter. It was during this period which the Continental Army scored the famous victories of Trenton and Princeton. These victories meant the British gave up their gains in New Jersey and gave the American cause hope. \n\nGeneral Howe finally launched his campaign for Philadelphia in July 1777. (Although it effectively started in August due to questionable logistical decisions) On the 11th of September Howe again defeated Washington at Brandywine Creek, with the Americans sustaining 1200 casualties, twice that of the British. However again Howe missed an opportunity to destroy Washington's army. Howe went onto capture Philadelphia on the 26th. However congress fled to Lancaster which meant that the British would have to decisively defeat the main Continental Army, which they could have done previously with ease and now Washington's principle strategy was avoiding a potentially deceive major battle in which the Americans had no resource. Washington again withdrew and Howe again missed an opportunity to destroy Washington and quartered in Philadelphia for the Winter. \n\nThroughout this period the British very much enjoyed an absolute position of strength but consistently ignored opportunities to destroy Washington's army which would have ended the war. It became apparent later on in the war that all the American forces needed to do to war was to survive - and the British allowed them to do this in 1776 and 1777. The British would never get opportunities afforded to them such as this throughout the rest of the war and the loss of Saratoga  meant the British never enjoyed such a position of strength again and crucially was the impetus for French, Dutch and Spanish intervention which meant British resources were now divided between preventing an invasion of Britain as well as protecting possessions in West Indies, Africa and India.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As historians we don't deal in \"What if?\"s, so sorry to say I'm going to ignore the second part of your question.\n\nThe first part is rather easy, and essentially boils down to a string of strategic blunders made by the British leadership, particularly Generals Howe and Burgoyne early in the war.\n\nIn the fall of 1777 the British Army was in a great position; General Howe had garrisoned New York City, and Lt. General Burgoyne had secured Quebec. Their focus was on defeating the New England colonies, as they were seen as the primary agitators of the rebellion. The plan was, then, to take New York by pincer movement; Howe from the south, Burgoyne from the north, as other Royal elements held the west. The decision to be made was when they would execute this attack: they could either begin the campaign immediately, and hope to finish before winter, or garrison up and wait until winter passed. The decision was to begin immediately, as the rebels were weakened, and essentially surrounded. The plan was to crush them completely, and wrap up the war the next spring.\n\nAs Burgoyne began his march south through Canada, Howe made the decision to move his army out of New York City to take Philadelphia, then the seat of the Continental Congress. This put Burgoyne in a terrible position, who had decided to cut off logistical ties with his northern contingencies in the expectation of meeting with Howe's army. In addition to that, Burgoyne's Native contingents had abandoned him due to an earlier defeat.\n\nBurgoyne's army fought with the rebel army in Saratoga over the course of about three weeks that fall. I'm not going to go into detail because the battle is obviously famous, and you can read that anywhere. However, it was Howe's change in strategy, and Burgoyne's neglect of his supply lines that left Burgoyne weakened and vulnerable, and ultimately resulted in his defeat, and his ostracism from the British military. This is typically considered the turning point in the war that allowed the rebels to gain the upper hand and continue on. \n\nIt should be noted that the war lasted an additional six years after the Battle of Saratoga, it was by no means decisive or easy for them. It did, however, allow for an easier winter for the rebel armies, gave them a strong foothold in New England, and allowed Washington to continue training troops for regular service to begin his offensive in the coming year. It also directly influenced France's decision to join the war, which arguably was all the rebels needed to shift the fight in their favor.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>This is a great question. In my opinion, it's totally plausible that a large number of enslaved persons in a region would have known about the reputation of a particularly harsh plantation. Since this is a hypothetical, I can only speak in generalities about enslaved peoples' access to geopolitical knowledge. I'll start with a few examples of historians who speak about this issue, and then move to a discussion of how this might have worked in practice in the world of Django.\n\nHistorian Philip Troutman describes a slave \"grapevine\" that carried a great volume of rumor and news. His example for the existence of a \"grapevine\" is the 1841 revolt on the *Creole* ship, where a group of slaves revolted and steered the ship to the Bahamas. Knowing that slavery had been outlawed in the British colonies, they understood that they would have a chance of freedom in the Bahamas. According to Troutman, this demonstrates their \"geopolitical literacy.\"\n\nAnother example of how this \"grapevine\" flowed was the African American and enslaved response to the Haitian Revolution. Historian Julius Scott has demonstrated how information spread about this event among communities of African descent throughout North America and the Caribbean. The speed and breadth of news dissemination about this event among slaves and free blacks in the western hemisphere that Scott shows is really breathtaking. In fact, rumors were so potent that at some times, slave revolts throughout North America and the Atlantic world were often premised on rumors of events happening elsewhere. \n\nIndeed, enslaved peoples' mental maps seem to have been based in large part on the apparent freedom of a space or its unfreedom. In the eighteenth century, slaves in North America were sometimes threatened with being sent to the West Indies, where it was understood that sugar production exacted a harsher toll on slaves. For many slaves, this was seen as a death sentence. On the other hand, some spaces were simply safe havens. For example, a runaway slave named Leonard Black stated that even though he did not know if Boston was a state or city, he knew that it represented liberation. Moreover, being informed about certain owners and plantations could be a form of resistance. As historian Walter Johnson has shown, slaves in the antebellum New Orleans slave market performed in certain ways to either make themselves appealing to certain kinds of owners, or else prevent other owners from purchasing them. It doesn't take much of an imaginative leap to wonder if slaves who were aware of the bad reputation of certain owners would have made themselves seem unappealing in the slave pen.\n\nSo how did slaves come to develop this geopolitical literacy? Probably not through reading. Slave masters and governments tended to police literacy and print very closely to prevent slaves from learning much about the outside world (Frederick Douglass remembered that \"Nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper\" and Henry Bibb, in his slave narrative, recalled \"the only source of information that I had to enlighten my mind, consisted in what I could see and hear from others. Slaves were not allowed books, pen, ink, nor paper.\"). Nevertheless, some slaves took advantage of opportunities to read books and newspapers. Frederick Douglass certainly did. Julius Scott reports on a case of slaves working for a Charleston newspaper in 1793, who took 200 copies of each issue for their own use, and presumably to disseminate among other literate slaves.\n\nOne of the keys to the \"grapevine\" was oral communication. As Julius Scott wrote, \"black cultural traditions that favored speech and white laws that restricted literacy gave a continuing primacy to other channels of communication.\" (115) Naturally, the other key was the mobility of the enslaved. Slave plantations were not isolated islands. Slaves moved between plantations often, bringing all kinds of information with them. Some slave masters were surprisingly permissive about allowing slaves to socialize between plantations. Some even permitted slaves to regularly visit a family member in an adjacent plantation. Some slaves likely did this without a master's permission. Runaways, especially if they were apprehended, also brought back all kinds of knowledge that could be fed into the \"grapevine.\" \n\nMoreover, there was a significant amount of movement between urban and rural environments for slaves. Slaves were probably especially well-informed in cities, where oral reports and printed news circulated widely. Relatively well-informed free blacks and sailors tended to congregate in cities. Their knowledge could find its way into a plantation easily. Free and urban blacks often came into contact with transient slaves. The most important slave markets in antebellum America were in urban spaces like Charleston and New Orleans. A slave who had just arrived from one of these urban centers might carry information or rumor about a plantation that he or she had been sold from, or had heard about from another enslaved person in a slave pen. Moreover, it wasn't uncommon in some parts of the South for a slave to be sent to a city to earn a temporary wage, if he wasn't needed in the plantation. Indeed, this happened to Frederick Douglass.\n \nOverall, it's easy to imagine that a slave in Candyland would have been resold and spread rumors about it. It's also easy to imagine that these rumors would have been of great interest to slaves listening, who would have repeated the rumor as they moved between plantations. If this rumor reached the node of an urban environment like New Orleans, it probably would have spread even more rapidly throughout the plantation South. The \"grapevine\" would have likely picked up on rumors of a particularly heinous plantation, and spread it around the South with remarkable efficiency. \n\nSources:\n\n* Philip Troutman, \"Grapevine in the Slave Market: African American Geopolitical Literacy and the 1841 Creole Revolt,\" in *The Chattel Principle,* edited by Walter Johnson (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004).\n* Gilbert Osofsky, editor, *Puttin\u2019 on Ole Massa* (New York: Harpers & Row, 1969), 17.

It reads almost like a novel but with sources. It covers one of the most sensational trials of early 19th century England (where the trial took place) and played an important part in ending slavery in the British Empire. Here is a synopsis.\n\nIn 1806 General Thomas Picton, Britain's first governor of Trinidad, was brought to trial for the torture of a free mulatto named Louisa Calderon and for overseeing a regime of terror over the island's slave population. James Epstein offers a fascinating account of the unfolding of this colonial drama. He shows the ways in which the trial and its investigation brought empire 'home' and exposed the disjuncture between a national self-image of humane governance and the brutal realities of colonial rule. He uses the trial to open up a range of issues, including colonial violence and norms of justice, the status of the British subject, imperial careering, visions of development after slavery, slave conspiracy and the colonial archive. He reveals how Britain's imperial regime became more authoritarian, hierarchical and militarised but also how unease about abuses of power and of the rights of colonial subjects began to grow.</p>",

Per capita this works out at 86.1 per 100,000 in 1960; 154.5 in 1969 and a peak of 441.8 in 1992 (population increases meant it peaked a year early per capita.)\n\nThe latest figures of 2014 put Aggravated Assault at 232.5 per 100,000.\n\nThese figures suggest that Aggravated Assault has become more common today than in 1960. However because these are arrest figures. The crime that your grandfather is talking about is more likely to be simple arrest which has the definition of \n\n>The UCR defines simple assault as an assault or attempted assault that does not involve a weapon or no serious or aggravated injury results to the victim. Stalking, intimidation, coercion, and hazing are included in this category of offense.\n\n[Source](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/aus8009.pdf)\n\nSimple assault figures were not available over the same period of time, however they have generally followed the same trend though growth was much higher in fact.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI cannot confirm, nor deny what your question asked. However what I can say is that arrests for assault, both aggravated and simple skyrocketed from 1960 to 2000, since 2000 levels have dropped below pre 1980 levels however are much much higher than 1960 and presumably 1940 and 50. This does not mean that assault was more common in the 1990s than it was in the 1940s and 50s but that it was more widely reported and taken more seriously as such arrest rates have gone up. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Regarding whether \"assault laws really [were] that weak... back then:\"\n\nIn the time period in question criminal law in the US would have been a patchwork of state laws (this is less the case today due to widespread adoption of the Model Penal Code), so whether \"punching\" someone would have amounted to an assault depends on the laws in that state at that time.  Generally speaking, this would have been an assault.  Modern assault laws trace their roots to common law assault crimes, under which such conduct would be an assault, and the specific assault laws that I have seen from that time would also cover such conduct.\n\nFor example, the Ohio General Code (in force from 1910 to 1953) defined criminal assault as \"assault[ing] or threaten[ing] another in a menacing manner, or unlawfully strik[ing] or wound[ing] another.\"  Ohio Gen. Code Sec. 12422.  \n\nNew York beginning circa 1910 appears to have defined third degree assault as \"an assault, or an assault and battery\" not specified elsewhere as second degree (poisoning, \"inflicting grievous bodily harm upon another, either with or without a weapon,\" assault with a weapon \"likely to produce grievous bodily harm,\" or assault with intent to commit another felony) or first degree (poisoning or assault with a firearm or other deadly weapon, with intent to kill or commit another felony).  Consolidated Laws of The State of New York, 1909, vol. 4, Article 20 Sec. 240 - 244.  (Unfortunately, I can't confirm how long these sections of law were good for - Ohio's section was renumbered between 1953 and repealed and replaced in 1972 and I can't locate that text, and I don't have LexisNexis access to NY law.)\n\nI haven't dug through case law to determine what courts considered an \"assault\" to be in either of these cases - the definitions are a bit tautological, as you can see - but the common law definition of assault as \"the threat or use of force on another\" is illuminating.  Black's identifies this definition back to the 14th century.  Black's Law Dictionary, 9th Ed. (As an aside, assault and battery can have different meanings at different times in different jurisdictions - although assault is often thought of as requiring a touching, assault in some jurisdictions is actually any act that puts another in reasonable* apprehension* of harmful or offensive contact; battery, on the other hand, always requires an actual touching.  Whether jurisdictions make this distinction, roll assault and battery into a single crime, or otherwise varies.)\n\nFor comparison as to whether the above examples were \"weak,\" consider the modern equivalents of those two statutes. Ohio Revised Code 2903.13 defines assault as \"knowingly caus[ing] or attempt[ing] to cause physical harm to another.\"  New York's is intentionally or recklessly causing physical injury to another.  New York Penal Law Sec. 120.  As you can see, other than an additional mens rea requirement, they cover basically the same conduct.\n\nWhile this is clearly not an exhaustive examination of assault statutes it should give some idea that the crime of assault really hasn't changed much - other than being codified it has hardly changed since its articulation in common law.  Additionally, the common law crimes of assault and battery (which as classically stated definitely would cover punching someone) would still have been good law in some jurisdictions at this time, as well as the civil tort versions.\n\nNote of course that doing something illegal and being prosecuted for it are two separate questions, and I am not equipped to answer that question.  Based on the text of the statutes, I would say that social norms and mores about \"settling things like men,\" as other commenters have said, is really the relevant question as far as \"getting away\" with it goes.</p>",

Many consider him to be the best president we've ever had, due in no small part to his guiding the country through the most important event in American history (maybe the entirety of it, but definitely since the Revolution): the Civil War. No topic has been poured over by American historians as much as the Civil War, and it's impossible to discuss without including Lincoln's assassination. Add in the fact that he was killed by John Wilkes Booth, one of the most recognized actors of the day (imagine the media frenzy if Obama were assassinated by Tom Cruise) and you have an extra layer of fascination and weirdness. But with the backdrop of the Civil War and Lincoln's death helping to shape the next 30 years of American policy, it's easy to see why people can't get enough of that tragic story.\n\nKennedy's assassination is so fascinating for a number of reasons, chief among them that it happened in the modern era. While historians have nothing to go on with the Lincoln/Garfield/McKinley assassinations but artists renderings and eyewitness accounts, Kennedy's assassination was caught on tape. Nearly everyone has seen the footage at some point. Then we have the conspiracy factor where no one is exactly sure what happened, how Oswald was himself killed before he could testify or provide any real clues, how a number of people had an axe to grind with Kennedy (from the mafia to Castro to maybe LBJ himself), etc. and you're left with quite the unsolved mystery. Also much like Lincoln, Kennedy's sudden death played an enormous role in shaping American policy and who would follow him as commander in chief over the next 20 years or so.\n\nThe assassinations of Garfield and McKinley, however, lack these kinds of backdrops that would give them relevance in popular culture like the deaths of Lincoln and Kennedy. It's not exactly fair to say they died during a \"lull\" in American history (1870-1915 or so, between the Civil and Great War), but they weren't killed with enormous backdrops behind them like the conclusion of the Civil War, or right between the Cuban Missile Crisis and early intervention into Vietnam. There's no juicy mystery/possible conspiracy into the deaths of Garfield or McKinley like we have with Kennedy, nor is there hours of photo or video evidence to dive into. And it's also much harder to argue that the sudden loss of Garfield or McKinley sharply changed American history - Lincoln's untimely demise greatly affected Reconstruction, and Kennedy's death greatly affected how we entered Vietnam and also tackled domestic issues like civil rights and LBJ's Great Society efforts. You'll have a much harder time arguing that Garfield or McKinley's assassinations created new circumstances that would not have happened otherwise (for example, McKinley's death opened the door for Teddy Roosevelt to become president, but he was such a force of personality that it may well have happened anyway with subsequent events remaining largely unchanged).\n\nTL;DR - we discuss Lincoln's death so much because he was so important to American history. We discuss Kennedy's assassination so much because people love conspiracies and because it happened so recently with tons of video evidence to examine. Meanwhile, the deaths of Garfield/McKinley did not sharply affect American history in the way that Lincoln/Kennedy did, and they presided over less \"exciting\" times, so they unfortunately are more likely to be left in history's dustbin.</p>",

Guy even checked with the mob that he'd be protected after the assassination and tried to tour the prison so he would know where he'd be living.  \n\nAfter Garfield died,  they passed the Pendleton Act, marking the end of the spoils system and created the first civil service reform which is still the basis for most federal regulations in regards to hiring actions and prohibited practices.</p>",

Am I right in understanding that some Medieval monks and clergy of the Catholic Church traveled frequently and extensively?  Is it accurate to infer that the vast majority of the population of Europe spent their lives close to where they were born and never did multi-day trips, or is that not true?)</p>",

In a collection of such tales from Byland Abbey in north Yorkshire, c. 1400, the beginning of one story has this detail:\n>It is worth remembering that there was a man from Cleveland named Richard Roundtree who, leaving his pregnant wife behind, went on pilgrimage to St. James at Compostela with a number of other people. One night they spent the night in the woods near the royal road. *Here one of them kept watch for part of the evening for fear of the night while the others slept securely.*\n\nSource: J.
