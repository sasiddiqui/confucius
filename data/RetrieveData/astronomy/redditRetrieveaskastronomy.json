                "answer": "<p>I am not totally familiar with Jovian physics, so I can only give an answer from a broad planetary perspective.\n\nCurrently, there are three main theories on the formation of giant planets. First and most highly regarded is core accretion. In this model, the genesis of giant planets begins the same as the well-known formation of the terrestrial planets, in which rocky grains continuously coagulate to produce a large body. This continues until the object reaches a critical mass (~10 Earth masses), at which point it begins to experience runaway accretion of gases. This continues until the protoplanetary disk becomes depleted around the orbit of the nascent planet, by which point it has gained perhaps at least 100 Earth masses of gases but not much more solid material.\n\nThe other two theories are quite similar. First is disk instability, where the gas mass of the protoplanetary disk is massive enough to fragment and collapse into a gaseous planet on its own, without much need for accretion. The second I am not aware of a particular name for, but the mechanism is that the planet forms in the same way that a star would, by collapse of bubbles of gas in the protostellar nebula (this is best compared to the formation of binary stars).\n\nThe three models produce planets that are similar on the outside (massive, mostly composed of light gases, often Hydrogen), but differ most in that core accretion planets have fairly large metallic cores - solid, though highly pressurised - while the others are expected to have no significant metallic cores.\n\nThe relative importance of these methods is crucial for understanding many things about planetary systems, but it is very difficult to determine what lies at the centre of a giant planet indirectly because they contribute only a small fraction of the total mass of the planet. Currently the solar system planets are the only ones that it is possible to directly determine core masses for with good precision. They are *expected* to have cores because core accretion does the best job at explaining most features associated with giant planets in general as well as the solar system planets, but actual observation is sorely needed.\n\n>That seems like a lot of rocks.\n\nYou would be surprised. For one, little of that mass is actually accreted, because Jupiter is more effective at scattering bodies than accreting them. A good example of this is in modern comets; changes in cometary orbits due to Jupiter are a regular occurrence, but a very small number of those orbit shifts result in impacts on the planet. Second, the amount of mass that has been accreted by Jupiter for its entire life after its formation is calculated to be miniscule-to-negligible compared to its 318 Earth masses. For that reason it is not expected that a coreless giant planet can \"create\" a core of the caliber that results from core accretion, because post-formation mass accretion is much too ineffective.</p>",

At one point in the month the moon will be \"ahead\" of the Earth, and in the ensuing 14 or so days, as it moves back to the trailing point, its position change will be slightly less than in the following 14 days, where it \"overtakes\" the Earth again. Basically the moons orbit around the Earth is an added component to the Moon/Earth's motion around the sun. I mean, sometimes adding sometimes subtracting.\n\nNow, I don't know the speed of the change in Earth/moon relative position over the course of a month in relation to the speed of movement around the sun. Perhaps it is a miniscule component??? But either way, it becomes a simple question of having fine enough instruments...\n\nYou *should* be able to notice that the position of the sun against the background stars, or the position of another planet against the background stars, has these pulses that slightly perturb the more regular motion that one observes from, say, the Earth.\n\nAnd the conclusion would be that there is a large body on the other side of your moon that you must be orbiting around.</p>",

With the same logic, if you can measure the distance to the sun to an accuracy better than one part in 400 you could detect the motion.\n\nIf you were to try to measure both distance and speed the combination of the two would make it obvious that you were orbiting something and the period of the orbit.\n\n[This page](http://www.eso.org/public//outreach/eduoff/aol/market/collaboration/solpar/#chap2) has some history about measuring 1AU.

Hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean or [\"worms from hell\"](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110601/full/news.2011.342.html) in deep mines both exist without sunlight.\n\nOne way to think of life harnessing energy is to look for some sort of steady state or frequent energy gradient. Something hot releasing heat to something cooler would have that. On earth, other than the sun that usually looks like radioactivity inside the earth releasing heat.\n\n>How can life harness gravitational energy?\n\nStrictly, the heat keeping the water a liquid on Europa is coming from *changing* gravitational forces. If two bodies were tidally locked, with no other satellites, this source of energy would not be available. With the multiple moons with orbital resonances and rotating Jupiter squeezing Europa this way and that it causes flexing (or possibly tides) to heat up the water. As long as there is a difference in temperature, thermal energy will flow across that gradient. It's not unreasonable speculation to suggest that the interface will be not uniform - there could be hot vents or even volcanoes down there. That sort of thing on earth creates various sorts of environmental gradients (changing ph or salinity or temperature etc.) that extremophiles survive or even thrive in. That means life is *possible*.\n\nI would suggest asking this on /r/askscience - there are planetary biologists who think about this stuff for a living.\n\nTL;DR changing gravitational forces -> kneading the planet -> heat -> environmental gradient -> life</p>",

All of the planets in our Solar System began to form this way, but close to the Sun the temperature was too high for volatiles (gases like water and methane) to condense, so only the materials with a higher melting point (and higher density) were able to form at this point. The gas giants on the other hand, formed far enough away from the Sun that the temperature was cool enough for these volatile gases to condense, and form these huge, less dense planets.\n\n[Source](https://www.spaceanswers.com/solar-system/why-are-planets-closer-to-the-sun-more-dense/)</p>",

While there is no sound in space (because there are too few molecules to let sound travel) the sun indeed makes sound. To quote the wiki \"The entire Sun vibrates from a complex pattern of acoustical waves, much like a bell.\"  [Here is a youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9URQW_hZ-vo) where scientists converted the vibrations into an audio signal. How loud is it?  Very loud.  The sun is VERY big (you can fit 1 million earths in the sun) - big sun, big sound. But again, that sound does not travel very far due to few molecules in space. BTW, technically the sun does not 'burn'.  It is a self-contained fusion reaction - which is not the same thing as fire (which requires an external, combustible, fuel source).\n\n2. Astronauts are normal people just like you and me.  So yes, they have families, houses, pets, etc. The only way they are not like you and me, is that they get to go to space for their job (I just get to peer at space for mine).\n\n3. It is important that when in space - you have lots of things to occupy your time.  On the ISS this is mostly spent doing a variety of scientific, behavioral, and environmental experiments.  Additionally there is repair and ongoing maintenance of the ISS. There, of course, is also the routine cleaning, food, sleeping, exercise, etc that we all need.\n\n4.  No, comets have tails because of solar wind. Far out from the sun, a comet has little to no tail - because it is cold and everything is frozen.  As it approaches the sun, it begins to warm up and ice turns to vapor.  The vapor is then driven by the solar wind, producing a tail. (Hint... if it were gravity producing the tail - the tail would point towards the sun... but in reality, the tail points away from the sun due to the solar wind being produced by the sun. [See more here](http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-solar-system/comet-power.html))\n\n5. This is a good question because the answer is not fully known.  Obviously, you can't stand on a gas giant as the gravity is too high (it would crush you).  But, let's pretend anyway.  Is a gas giant gas - all the way through?  Probably not.  Why?  Two reasons - the further toward the center of the planet you go, the larger the pressure - at some point that pressure will solidify the gasses.  The second reason, gas giants are constantly bombarded by asteroids, etc.  These are rocky/metallic - what happens?  While they may be largely vaporized and turn into gas - some components may survive to create a rocky core.  However, the overall answer to your question is No - as any core (if there is one) is small and at the highly pressurized center.\n\n6. Considering the diversity of life on earth - they could look like just about anything.\n\n7.  Well, Voyager 1 looks way different from other spacecraft we have created - so the answer would be No.  Even our own spacecraft look different from each other.  (Another point here is we have yet to discover alien life.) \n\nHope this helps!  (BTW... all REALLY great questions! Smart kids!)\n\nEdit: Feel free to ask any follow-up questions.\n\nEdit 2: Added more specifics to certain answers.</p>",

These particles interact very weakly with each other and the overwhelming absence of friction prevents clumping and not even the early stages of BH formation are reached. However, due to the somewhat awkward nature of these massive particles, *something interesting* is bound to happen as the collisions become increasingly more energetic over time, and as the local energy density increases so does the mass, leading to situations akin to those of Neutron stars where a significant portion of its measurable gravitational effect comes not from its baryonic mass, but from its gravitational mass.  \n\n***\n\n**WIMPs** (Weakly-Interacting Massive Particles) - Cold/Hot Dark Matter\n\n* Are high mass particles (predicted by R-parity conserving supersymmetry)\n* Fermionic interaction allows friction and scattering\n* is \"dark\" because it does not interact electromagnetically nor via the strong force, only weakly and gravitationally\n* Pro: Makes sense on paper, would make a lot of sense if found\n* Con: Same theory which predicts this particle has failed to produce any of its (other) predicted particles at the LHC\n\n**BH:** *Thinking...*\n\n***\n\n**MACHOs** (Massive Compound Halo Objects) - Hot Dark Matter\n\n* Consists of ordinary baryonic matter\n* is \"dark\" simply because it does not emit radiation, for whatever reason, e.g., due to massive gravitational distortion\n* Pro: It's solid and simple\n* Con: Far too baryonic. Lack of experimental proof. \n\n**BH:** According to online literature, this kind of \"dark matter\" could, in fact, *be* black holes. To my understanding, this kind of \"dark matter\" is akin to a mostly-homogeneous yet clumpy 'gas' whose 'particles' are stuff like brown dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. The question is moot because it's a case of making black holes from other black/dark holes.\n\n***\n\n**EDIT:** My time is limited right now, but I'll return to edit this post later.</p>",

They were only noticed because astronomers were attempting to match up visible objects with sources that were strong emitters of radio waves (the radio telescope was a relatively new invention). A lot of the radio sources turned out to look like normal stars, but nothing else was like what you would expect from a star. The name quasar comes from the term \"Quasi Stellar Object\". Spectrograms of these objects were obviously not stellar in nature but it took some years before telescopes were able to confirm that quasars were embedded in distant galaxies. For many years there was a major controversy over whether quasars were within the Milky Way or not (there is an episode of the original series of Star Trek where they come across a quasar) and astronomer Halton Arp maintained until his death that their redshift was not caused by their distance. Now we know that a quasar is one of a class of objects that we call Active Galactic Nuclei. It seems that some of the different classes of AGN's may evolve over time into one another in some cases. In some cases it is a matter of it living in a different environment. In other cases the difference is a matter of perspective. Quasars emit narrow jets of material and radiation along an axis. If we happen to be looking directly into a jet we see what is called a Blazar when from any other position in the universe it would just look like a normal quasar. The existence of Black Holes was not taken very seriously until they became necessary to explain what is going on in a quasar.</p>",

Orbits are often depicted of one body orbiting another, but that's actually not the case. Instead, two objects are always in orbit around a common center of mass (barycenter). So Jupiter isn't just pulling on the sun when close, but at any time. \n\nThe reason why you can depict the planets as orbiting the sun is, that the sun has 99,86% the mass of the solar system and so the barycenter lies very close to the sun. In fact, it's inside the sun if you look for each relation of sun-planet, except for Jupiter, where it lies outside. \n\nSince the solar system has 8 planets and countless other bodies, the overall barycenter of the solar moves in relation to the sun, as any planet is moving in orbit. That causes the barycenter to be sometimes inside and sometimes outside of the sun.

The courses are rigorous, the professors expect your very best effort. It will be more or less assumed that you intend to do research with your degree, which will mean 4 years of grad school more than likely.\n\nWhy is there so much teaching amongst astronomy graduates? Well, a lot of time teaching goes hand-in-hand with research. You have some research you want to do. A university is willing to hire you and let you do your research, but you also have to teach. If you don't want to do research, and didn't go to grad school, teaching is still a good option, especially if you don't want to go to grad school, but another option may be telescope operating. If you want to get in to that, Arizona would be a REALLY good option, because you will have the chance to operate on multiple research grade telescopes in your undergraduate career. I mean, you barely have to try.\n\nYou can also combine the astronomy major with something else, say, journalism. We need great science journalists. Or maybe you could stick with your major, and minor in astronomy. Maybe there's a place for someone with that background.\n\nMe, personally, I'm into outreach. I have actually switched majors to general studies. I cannot recommend this, as I'm pretty terrified myself of what people will think. It's sort of a cheat degree. I have a very wide variety of classes I can take and still get a degree.

What defines a \"surface\"?\n\nYes, there may be a sharp density jump at the boundaries where the heavy elements are. But is that a surface? Let's imagine you got transported there. You have a density of about 1 g/cm^(3). The \"gas\" around you has a density of about 5 g/cm^(3). You would be so buoyant that you'd immediately skyrocket up off the \"surface\" until you found the region of 1 g/cm^3 area for you to stably float around in.\n\nPlus the temperatures and pressures are so high at that \"surface\" that I'm not sure any of it would be solid, which also goes against the idea of a surface.\n\n\n</p>",

The log is base 10. We are told that F = 10000F\u1d62, and that m\u1d62 = 12. Rearranging and plugging in, we get\n\nm = -2.5 log(F / F\u1d62) + m\u1d62 = -2.5 log(10000) + 12 = -2.5(4) + 12 = -10 + 12 = 2.\n\nSo yes, if the values you've provided are correct, then this would be a magnitude 2 star, meaning we would easily be able to see this with the naked eye. It would be as bright as Polaris (the North Star)!\n\nOne useful thing to keep in mind is that a decrease of 5 magnitudes gives an increase in brightness of 100 times. Knowing this, we could have just recognized that 10,000 is just increasing brightness by 100 times twice, so the magnitude should decrease by 5 twice, so we would have m = 12 - 5(2) = 2.

                "answer": "<p>They aren't really photoshopped, it's more that the images are taken using specific filters.\n\nTo get a color (RGB) image of an object, Hubble would take at least three photos: One using a red filter which only allows red light through, one with a green filter, and finally one with a blue filter. They would likely take several photos in each filter in order to reduce noise. If you were to look at, say, the red image by itself, it would just look like a grey scale image. \n\nOnce the images are processed, they're stacked using a computer which turns all the images into just one. Astronomers then can go in and assign colors to each channel, making the red channel appear red, and so on. This creates an RGB color image.\n\nBut often times what's interesting to study is not what we can see with our eyes. Say you're interested in the Crescent Nebula so you go out with your telescope and observe it without using any extra equipment. [This](http://astronomer.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NGC6888.jpg) is what you would likely see.\n\nNow say you're an astronomer using Hubble and you want to get a color image of it. Using filters, you take R, G, an B images and combine them into something that might look something like [this](http://darkhorizons.emissionline.com/images/flt/crescent-rgb.jpg) (note, that was not taken with Hubble).\n\nBut what if you're interested in the chemical make-up of the Crescent Nebula? In particular, say you're interested in the distribution of hydrogen and oxygen. So you get a few different filters, which only allow a very narrow range of light through, which allow you to image specific emission lines of the hydrogen and oxygen and *only* of the hydrogen and oxygen. You then go through the same process that you would go through to make a stacked RGB image - you assign one channel to be red, another green, and the last blue - and your final image might turn out looking something like [this](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0909/NGC6888_Lopez.jpg).\n\nSo that final image isn't really what the Crescent Nebula \"looks like\", but it's highlighting very specific features of it and completely ignoring the rest. \n\nIf you want to see what objects really \"look like\", look up RGB or true color images of that object and it will give you a better idea.</p>",

Radio communication is viable over interstellar distances given enough power and suitable antennas, but it takes a long time for light to travel through interstellar space, and without direct contact, it is difficult to know which frequencies people are transmitting on and the encoding scheme of their signals.  \n\nAnd it may be that interstellar travel is simply so expensive and energy-intensive that technological civilizations simply never bother with it.  Certainly just the raw energy requirements to get a spaceship going fast enough to permit traveling across interstellar space within a (ship-frame) human lifetime is pretty staggering, and fueling such a ship may simply never be practical.  For example, if you want a human-crewed ship to travel 100 ly, you should probably be thinking about a ship-frame journey of ~10 yr, barring suspended animation.  This means that our time dilation factor, or \"gamma\", needs to be about 10.  The kinetic energy of such a highly relativistic ship is roughly gamma * m * c^2 .  For the Space Shuttle, m ~ 2,000 tonnes.  This corresponds to a kinetic energy of ~1.7E24 J, or as much energy as the Sun puts out in about 1/100 of a second.  It's also equivalent to the explosive energy contained in roughly 1/3 of a petaton of TNT.  But of course you also need fuel, and you need to accelerate that fuel, and there are inefficiency losses, etc.  The whole thing just snowballs for any energy source we know of.\n\nBut then again, maybe there is some unknown energy source we can tap into (unlikely), or some way of circumventing the light speed barrier (unliklier still), with all the time travel baggage that implies.  Or something else that makes interstellar travel much more practical, or at least doable as more than a theoretical exercise.  Nobody knows.  So, the only answer I can truthfully give to your question is a shrug, but I would lean towards the second option.</p>",

Location: North Denver near the Northglenn Open Space (39.898982,-105.014343) Direction of object: towards the Southwest, ~235 degrees Azimuth: ~35-45 degrees.\n\nThat direction and time of the night? Venus. :) I used [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/en/) to  simulate the view from Denver and indeed Venus was up until about 10 pm. To confirm: When you were observing through your telescope, did you have to nudge the scope every now and then to keep the object in view? If yes, then 100% you were looking at Venus, which moves with the sky. If not, then it was something terrestrial. Bonus: Did you see a crescent shape, even momentarily? [Venus has phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_Venus), like our Moon, and is currently about half illuminated.\n\nThe rest of your post is a detailed description of twinkling caused by a turbulent atmosphere. This effect is called [seeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing) and it sounds like it was very poor for your area on that day. It would explain why you saw several blobs moving and merging, like in the gif in the Wikipedia article. And, as you may suspect, toy telescopes have poor optics. On top of magnifying the effect of atmospheric turbulence, they can cause artifacts such as chromatic aberration and distorted images. \n\nNow for the good news! You truly have a talent for detailed observations and your drawing is very realistic! With a bit more preparation you might enjoy amateur astronomy. Good call on the binoculars: they're probably of better optical quality than the telescope, and I bet they're more stable too! Take them out again on a clear night and check out the Moon, the Pleiades and Orion's nebula. Also, Mars is near Venus (you may have seen it as a fainter reddish star) and Jupiter rises later in the night - none of them will show details in binoculars, but it's satisfying to know you're looking at actual real planets!

                "answer": "<p>There are two parts to your question, and I didn't think of the second until I looked in [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/).\n\nThe first, as you mention, is the thickness of the atmosphere.  I have found an applicable quote which hints at the answer:  The [Huygens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens_probe) probe was unable to detect the direction of the Sun during its descent, and although it was able to take images from the surface, the *Huygens* team likened the process to \"taking pictures of an asphalt parking lot at dusk\".  [Another quote](http://www.space.com/710-huygens-probe-sheds-light-titan.html) mentions that \"Little sunlit \\[sic\\] penetrates the dense hydrocarbon atmosphere [\u2026]\".\n\nBased on these two quotes, I'm going to say that if so little light made it through the atmosphere that they couldn't determine the direction to the Sun, chances are that you probably wouldn't be able to see Saturn or its rings from the surface of Titan.  I'm not 100% sure on it, but it's an educated guess.\n\nNow, for the other part of your question, let's assume the atmosphere wasn't an issue.  Would you see the rings?  Would they look like rings?\n\n[Titan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_\\(moon\\)) has a very low orbital inclination with regard to Saturn, of only 0.348\u00b0 relative to Saturn's equator.  Standing at Titan's equator looking toward Saturn, the rings would never appear to be much more than a line.  Titan is big, with a radius of 2,576 km (vs 1,737 km for the Moon), so it might look different from the polar regions; but it is also far away from Saturn, at an average of 1,221,870 km (vs 384,399 km for the Moon) and has a relatively circular orbit (eccentricity of 0.0288, vs 0.0549 for the Moon).  The ['F' ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#F_Ring), which is the outermost discrete ring around Saturn, is at a distance of 140,180 km from the center of Saturn - still pretty close in, compared to Titan.  I'm going to say that, even from the polar regions, even if you could see through the atmosphere, the rings of Saturn wouldn't appear like much more than a line.\n\nIf you wanted a magnificent display of the rings from one of Saturn's moons, I might try dropping a probe on [Iapetus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_\\(moon\\)), which has a highly inclined orbit.  Or better yet, I might drop a probe on [Rhea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_\\(moon\\)), which it's thought [may have rings of its own](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13421-saturn-satellite-reveals-first-moon-rings.html).</p>",

Only stars that are massive enough to eventually fuse iron in their cores can become core collapse supernovae. This takes at least 8 times the mass of the Sun.\n\nAs described by the [initial mass function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function), such massive stars are quite rare. As such, most stars simply lack the preliminary mass.\n\nSome stars have a second chance when a white dwarf, the exposed core of a dead star that wasn't enough to collapse directly into a supernova and has already gone though the red giant phases and become a planetary nebula, has mass spilled onto it from a companion star in its red giant phase. The companion swells up and spills mass onto the white dwarf. If enough mass is accumulated on the white dwarf to push it over 1.44 solar masses (the [Chandrasekhar Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit) ) it can explode as a Type Ia supernova. However, consider that this is a rare event because it requires so many specific conditions: 1) a white dwarf just below this limit 2) a companion star that is 3) entering the red giant phase and 4) it does not pile up so quickly or at such a localized point that it undergoes fusion on the surface, knocking off the material in a regular nova before reaching the limit.\n\nYet as rare as Type Ia supernovae are, they are still common enough that they have been used to measure the expansion of the universe since they specificity of all these conditions makes them excellent [standard candles](http://universe-review.ca/R02-07-candle.htm).\n\nIt is also of note that some novae can [be recurrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova#Recurrent_novae).</p>",

It takes a lot of computer time to separate the data from the noise to find these things.\n\nAnd Kepler isn't the best example of a compute-heavy astronomy project. Though some Kepler searches, like HEK, require more oomph than others. (HEK has a \"help us find exomoons\" page! see below.) HEK is fairly lightweight. They're just asking for a minicomputer (a mini supercomputer). \n\n- http://www.petridish.org/projects/help-us-find-the-first-exomoon\n\nBut it varies a lot. \n\nCompare HEK to two other areas: massive radio telescopes, and massive survey telescopes. Two heavy hitters there are ALMA in Chile, and the upcoming LSST telescope. ALMA needs the highest elevation supercomputer ever made, so it can \"correlate\" all the radio signals from 60+ dishes. They claim their \"correlator\" supercomputer is more powerful than any US Dept of Defense machine. (Plus, it's so high up, they can't afford to use disks on it - too irradiated up there.)\n\nThen the LSST will produce so much data that it's not actually economically achievable today. They're relying on Moore's Law to cheapen the storage they need by the time the project really starts. It'll take over a petabyte of data a year (>1024 terabytes), which can't be reviewed by human eyes. So they need a computer with \"100 teraflops of computing power and 15 petabytes of storage\".\n\nMost modern survey telescopes have large computer installations attached.\n\n- http://www.nrao.edu/explorer/alma/TheAlmaExplorer.php?id=AOS_012&map=AOS_TB\n- http://www.lsst.org/lsst/science/petascale\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope\n\n\n</p>",

Kepler is monitoring 145,000 stars simultaneously.  It doesn't see planets pass in front of the stars, it sees the light from the stars dim.  It produces light curves, which show the intensity of light from a star over time.  Astrophysicists apple statistical models to these light curves to try and detect subtle variations in them which might indicate the presence of a planet.  They typically need to show three passes before it is considered that there *may* be a planet there.  Follow-up work, whether by the Kepler team or someone else, looks for further indications.\n\nLast month, the Kepler team discovered a planet ([Kepler-37b](http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2013/feb/HQ_13-057_Kepler_Tiny_Planet.html)\\) slightly larger than our Moon.  That makes this is a reasonable example.  Let's say Kepler is looking at a star when a planet the size of the Earth passes in front of it.  The light from the star will dip as this planet begins its transit, and rise again as the planet finishes its transit.  Let's say this Earth-sized planet has a Moon-sized moon.  Assuming they're as close together as our Moon is to us, and that at this point in its orbit, the moon is trailing the planet, Kepler will see the light from the star drop as the planet starts to cross in front of it, and then drop a little more as the moon tags along.  On the flip side, the light curve will jump up as the planet finishes its transit, and then jump up a little more as the moon joins it.\n\nI have more I was going to say, but I just found a paper which describes [transit models for planets with moons and ring systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5599), so I'll let the professionals take it from here.</p>",

Pressure at the core of a planet can be much higher than that, so even if the whole thing is made of H2O, and even if it's so hot the surface is actively boiling, the core is likely solid.\n\nThis is true for basically any known substance, including very lightweight stuff such as hydrogen.\n\nTo keep the core liquid, pressure would need to be low, which means the planet would be small, which raises questions of stability - would it then evaporate rather quickly? (\"quickly\" on a cosmic scale) The answer is likely yes, it would probably evaporate and disappear, because escape velocity would be much less than the thermal energy of molecules on the surface.\n\nThat's basically what happens to comets as they are approaching the Sun. They are made of ice, which then sublimates due to heat and creates the tail of the comet.\n\n**TLDR:** No.</p>",

A lot of astronomical theory is going to depend on being comfortable with algebra at least.\n\nIf you can do this *sometime* during her childhood it will be amazing.

Also important or useful is moon phase, local characteristics (light pollution in the city, dark skies, obstructions and what they are, type of ground surface), time of night, data procured from sites like [Clear Dark Sky](http://cleardarksky.com/csk/index.html) and a [light pollution map](http://djlorenz.github.io/astronomy/lp2006/overlay/dark.html), description of how she perceives the seeing (naked eye and through the telescope - are the stars shimmery, dim, bright, sharp, etc.; does the atmosphere appear murky, hazy, or clear; how is the resolution through the scope from poor to excellent; anything else she notes), and so forth.  \n\nMaybe suggest a few data points to look for and record (perhaps add moon phase, time of day, and maybe the light pollution map to your original list), and encourage her to write down anything else she notices or thinks of.  As she notes various things, I think she'll naturally start to notice other things as she gains experience.  Eventually, she will start to notice that certain parameters affect her astronomical observations in certain ways, at which point she will start to form her own hypotheses.  Ask her open-ended questions about what she's seeing and what she thinks about it, and what it might mean.\n\nOf course, early on maybe only suggest a few things to record, but this is really dependent on her.  At that age, keeping it light and fun is more important, but I think the elements of discovery, challenge, and mystery solving are fun for a lot of kids.  It is tough for astronomy, though, because there are so many uncontrollable, unpredictable variables.  The only things really predictable in a reliable manner are moon phase and objects that will be visible on a given night.\n\nThe trick for you, OP, is finding the best way to guide and encourage her, without being too leading in your suggestions and questions.  Even if she never gets to the point of developing a hypothesis, being in the habit of recording her observations will set her up to do well when it comes to middle school and high school science classes, and on into college.</p>",

So you'll be taking just about all the physics and related math courses you can. I suggest you look into some programming and statistics courses, even if only as electives, as these are valuable tools in any research career. \n\nFrom personal experience, I can say talk to your advisor. Like weekly. Annoy them with your presence. I saw my general advisor like four times, they had no idea what I needed, and neither did I. I wasted time in creative writing, archaeology and others because they were \"interesting\" to me. Everything I learned in those classes could have been learned from a few books off Amazon, and not blown a semester and thousands of dollars better spent on maths and reaching my goals. \n\nAs a career, there is research, teaching (often a payment to the piper for funding), all depending on how you chose your specialty, be it observational or theoretical. Be prepared to wrestle every funding cent that is available from hands that would rather spend it on practical applications. Astronomy projects are usually not cheap if they rely on new instruments, and materials science and chemistry (which provide income via patents) are seen as better investments by the powers that be. This is from a professor I had, though they might have just been bitter about their career state. \n\nBut like I said, I strongly encourage you to talk to your advisor, and find a mentor in the field you want to work in, make sure you aren't wasting time on electives you don't need, and be good at math. There is sooo much math. If I had good advisement, and had listened to that which was offered, I'd probably be doing something more with my thousands of dollars of education. </p>",

Depending on whether your undergrad institution offers an astronomy/astrophysics major, you might even be a physics major, which is totally fine for pursuing grad school in astro later on. Computer science and statistics are also helpful subjects to learn but not as critical. Regardless of your major, you can get into astronomy research by doing a [summer REU](https://astrobites.org/2013/01/05/so-you-want-to-apply-for-an-reu-heres-how/), which has the bonus of being super fun!\n\nThere are a lot of career paths to follow. You can go to grad school in astronomy and pursue an academic career path (ending up as a university professor who does research and teaches). You can also work for a space agency like NASA, at an observatory, at a museum/planetarium doing outreach, as a science writer, as a teacher, etc. Plus astronomy and physics teach you marketable skills, so there's always the option of going into industry doing something like finance or data science.

Most astronomy careers are based on active research within some ongoing astronomical programme. \n\nI think the responses in this thread a bit short sighted as a PhD/research job in astronomy/astrophysics could really be anything you want it to be. Yes your late-game career involves teaching and lecturing and getting funding and whatnot, but in the short term you should focus on doing a degree/PhD in something you're passionate about (in my opinion). In my group we have engineers, software developers, instrument designers, theoreticians, optics guys, on-site testing of instruments, lecturers, teachers, admin, media relations etc. We all chip in where possible but we all have our areas of expertise. \n\nFor example I work in the field of Exoplanets, arguably the best field in Astronomy ;), and my main 'job' is to develop a deeper understanding of the cameras and optics we use to image the planets. So really I'm an optical/electronic engineer who writes some software, runs a few basic simulations and develops experimentation. But on paper I'm an 'astrophysicist'. I'll also add I had no idea how to do any of this when I started, but that's a big part of it.\n\nI started like you, simply loving looking at the night sky but modern astronomy/astrophysics is so much more than that. I realised I loved the idea of exoplanets and that there was a world expert at my University so I set up a meeting and applied for a PhD there.\n\nSo find a topic in particular you love (galaxies, stars, planets, atmospheres, instrumentation, simulation, cosmology ...) and then try to find what is actively going on in that topic now and in the future. Get in touch with local universities, try to arrange meetings, and get involved! Nothing is more attractive than enthusiasm and passion when considering an applicant once they meet the baseline requirements.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Since you're in high school, it's important to focus on getting good at math and physics as much as you can now, and letting your teachers know it. Here's what an ideal path would look like:\n\n- **Step 1**, high school: Get good high school grades, especially in math and science. If it all possible, try to take AP Calculus and AP Physics your senior year, and do well. Get to know your math and science teachers, let them know your aspirations, talk with them after class so you stand out and they'll later write you good recommendations for undergrad.\n\n- **Step 2**, undergrad: Get into a good undergrad university, particularly one well known for its physics program. Continue taking lots of math and science courses and excelling at them. Get to know your professors, go to their office hours, find a professor whose physics (or maybe astronomy) research interests you and ask if they need any undergrad research assistants. By your junior year, start taking notice of which grad schools have astronomers that are very well known for research that fascinates you. If possible, try to get one paper published during undergrad. Get a major in physics. For your minor, go for something related that will help you later, such as astronomy, math, computer science (if you're more into theory), statistics (if you're more into observation), optics or electrical engineering (if you're more into instrumentation).\n\n- **Step 3**, applying to grad school: Apply to grad schools that specialize in your chosen research topic. Have your undergrad professors write you great recommendations, especially those that you've done research for. Try to do well on the Physics GRE Subject test - it's your combination of undergrad research experience, great recommendations, good grades, and GRE scores that will let you get in to top grad schools.\n\n- **Step 4**, grad school: When in grad school, focus on research as early as possible. Grad-level classes are important for learning the basics, but ultimately your research will matter much more in the long-run. You may end up switching research topics while in grad school, which is perfectly fine, but ultimately try to end up in a research field that is new and at the cutting edge of astronomy. Go to as many conferences as possible presenting your research. Very importantly, try to network with as many astronomers at other schools in your research field as possible, since those will be the folks who hire you later. Publish as many papers as you can. Try to get your own grant funded while in grad school. Expect to spend at least 5 - 7 years getting a PhD. If you've done your networking well, you should already have a postdoctoral position lined up before handing in your thesis. Get used to eating ramen noodles, because you're not going to be paid much during grad school.\n\n- **Step 5**, postdoc: Do at least one 3-year postdoc (though you'll probably need to do at least two) working with another leader in your research field at a different university. Be open to moving every few years to wherever the leaders in your field are. Publish as much as you possibly can during this period, continuing to get your name out there both in journals and at conferences. Get your own funding from a grant you've written. Serve on as many NASA panels as you can, both for networking, and so you know what kind of grant proposals get funded.\n\n- **Step 6**, applying to faculty positions: Hope that somewhere, some university is looking for a tenure-track faculty member that specializes in your field - if you've chosen a very new, cutting-edge field of research, there should at least be a couple opportunities. That said, the faculty application process is brutally competitive...it's not uncommon to have at least 200 applicants to a single faculty position. Make sure that you're one of the leaders in your field so that you are the obvious hire.\n\n- **Step 7**, faculty: Now that you're new faculty, try to take on as much responsibility as possible. Continue publishing like crazy, getting multiple grants, start mentoring grad and undergrad students, teach lots of intro to astronomy classes, do lots of astronomy outreach, take on administrative duties in your department. With any luck, the combination of excelling at all those things will help you get tenure when you evaluation comes due.\n\nSource: Astronomy PhD who got to Step 6.</p>",

The optical depth of the dust will vary some with orbit, but not ever nearly enough to get a clear view of the center of the Galaxy. (Things like Baade's Window are a degree or two away from the center.) The nearest square degree is going to be pea soup from anywhere 8 kpc away in the plane of the Galaxy. Even if it thins a bit, there are  30 magnitudes of extinction from our present position in V band, which is a factor of 10^12 (meaning only 1 in a trillion optical photons reaches us from the Galactic center). Even if we got a momentary window that was 1000x better than the view we have now, that's still a hell of a lot of extinction. </p>",

If you want to build rockets and satellites and probes, you want to do an engineering degree (e.g. Aerospace Engineering) and work for someone like NASA and SpaceX. If you want to do research on galaxies and planets and nebulae, you want to do a science degree (e.g. astrophysics) and probably work for a university.\n\nI can tell you about astronomy/astrophysics, which is what I do. Overall, it goes like this: *most* people who want to get into grad school can do so, especially in North America where you don't need to apply for separate funding. After that, *most* people who want to get a postdoctoral research position can get one. A postdoc is a fixed term (~3 year) position where you purely do research and \"prove\" yourself as an independent research. People generally do about 2 of these.\n\nHowever, after that, *only about 20%* of people get a permanent position in academic astronomy research. This is the tricky bit: you've finished your PhD and two postdocs, you're now 35 and only then do you discover that you haven't actually made it into the career you've been working towards. The other 80% aren't unemployed though: astronomers are generally quite employable, just not necessarily in the field of astronomy. Many move into engineering, programming, or teaching, so the in-depth technical education is not put to waste. I know people who have gone into meteorology, oceanography, and administering supercomputers for instance.\n\nThere's a solid chance that if you go into astronomy you might not be an astronomer forever. However, you will likely complete your PhD and do original research in astronomy for ~6 years afterwards, and you will almost certainly end up doing something technical and interesting.</p>",

The rest get made by large stars before they go supernova by the slow neutron capture s-process. Not completely understood is the rapid proton capture rp-process.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rp-process\n\nIf you want to understand the process more fully read this article and follow the links provided at the end, especially the post helium burning of Carbon, Neon, Oxygen, and Silicon. It also helps to understand the differences between the \"proton-proton chain\" and the \"carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle\" fusion types that take place in normal stars depending on their mass, density, and temperature.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis\n\nThe basic deal about the Iron nucleus is that it takes less binding energy to hold it together than any other compound nucleus so that any other configuration requires an energy input to achieve. An Iron core starts to accumulate in an older high mass star. At first it is just inert and produces no energy, but as it's mass grows it starts to collapse to the point where it will undergo fusion, but instead of providing an energy source from the fusion to balance gravity and hold the star up it consumes the available energy, causing a sudden catastrophic collapse.</p>",

I have absolutely no idea how interaction with nebula or gas clouds would affect this however.\n\nDespite this, our fate is sealed.

Space keeps going on and on; the farther you travel from where you started, the more space you discover. Time, however, is more bounded. There may be an infinite amount of space in our universe, but as we understand it, there has been a determinate amount of time since the big bang, therefore a finite amount of time for events to occur in that space.\n\nThen there's the matter of space itself. Given an infinite expanse of both space *and* time (or, more accurately, either spacetime, matter/energy or both), everything that can happen, does. And our current understanding does suggest that there is an infinite amount of space, however, there is no evidence to suggest that our universe contains an infinite amount of matter. In contrast, we believe that when spacetime was created in the big bang it was populated with a fixed amount of energy and matter. As space itself expands, the density of that matter and energy decreases.\n\nSo, to answer your question, in a theoretical universe with infinite time and/or an infinite amount of matter and/or energy (not just space, but matter/energy with which to fill that space), yes, everything that can happen, does. However, according to our modern understanding of cosmology, that's not the universe we live in.\n\nHowever, given the extraordinarily large amount of matter and time *in the observable universe alone*, it is likely that sentient life has at least existed in the history of the observable universe, if not at this very moment.

Well, the answer is the same color it is, because the reason it is emitting is because it is behaving roughly like a [blackbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) at some temperature. The surface is in thermal equilibrium and so for a blackbody the emitted spectrum is a function only of the temperature. So in that case, you don't really have a star that's not producing light.\n\nThe temperature of a neutron star is very hot. So while its peak emission would be somewhere in the X-ray range, it would appear to us as white or blue-ish-white, because there's more of those photons emitted than the redder side of the spectrum.\n\nOf course, we as people emit in the infrared (as a crude blackbody) but we have a color because light is reflecting off us and certain wavelengths are being absorbed while others aren't. Again, for the same reason that logic doesn't apply to normal stars (whose emission is dominated not by reflected light but by their own blackbody radiation), I don't think that won't be the case for neutron stars.</p>",

Planets have proved to be extraordinarily efficiently produced.\n\nThat said, only the closest (<15-20 parsec) sun-like stars are visible to the naked eye, and due to the statistics of planetary detectability, not many have *known* planets. [Upsilon Andromedae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon_Andromedae) and [Epsilon Eridani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Eridani) are some of the brightest solar-type planet hosts in the northern hemisphere, and both have interesting, well-studied systems.\n\nFor giant stars, however, their luminosities mean many are visible to the naked eye. Giant planets around higher mass stars *seem* to be relatively common (the exact nature of the signals is somewhat ambiguous, but planetary causes are generally the most likely), and indeed many of the low giants with Bayer designations have known planets. The brightest example is [Pollux (Beta Geminorum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollux_\\(star\\)), and there are many other examples available in the northern hemisphere.\n\nDue to the difficulty of detecting planets similar in mass and orbit to Earth with current technology, no star visible to the naked eye is known to host a potentially earth-like planet.

I will post it here too:\n\n> Let's actually calculate how big a telescope would need to be to do what you ask. Let's say we need a telescope that can resolve a continent on an Earth-like planet orbiting our nearest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri. Let's say the continent is about the size of the United States: about 3000 miles or about 4800 kilometers. If this Earth-like planet is orbiting Proxima Centauri, then it is about 4.2 light years away, or about 4e13 km. So, on an angular scale, that continent subtends an angle of 4800/4e13 ~ 1.2e-12 radians or about 6.9e-9 degrees.\n> \n> Physics tells us that to resolve something at a wavelength lambda that subtends an angle of theta radians, you need a telescope of at least a diameter D where\n> \n> theta = 1.22 lambda / D\n> \n> Rearranging that, we get\n> \n> D = 1.22 lambda / theta\n> \n> So, assuming we wanted to look at this planet in optical light (lambda ~ 550 nanometers) and resolve a continent that subtends an angle theta = 1.2e-12 radians, we would need a telescope with a diameter D = 560,000 meters. That is gigantic!\n> \n> There are other hurdles that one would need to overcome, but just needing a telescope this big is the largest problem.\n> \n> There are some advances to solving this problem using a technique called interferometry where you can use multiple, smaller telescopes spread out and achieve the same angular resolution as a larger telescope without actually building a telescope that big. This is done all the time with radio light, but the technology still isn't reliable enough for a large-scale optical interferometer.</p>",

This is more important than directly observing the planet surface features for many reasons:\n\n* Surface study would only be good on the closest and biggest planets.\n\n* Atmospheric study can tell us much more about what might be on the ground, allowing us to more quickly compile targets for further and closer observation.\n\n\n* Atmospheric studies can tell us about surface features even if the surface features are obscured by atmospheric conditions (think Venus). \n\nKeeping in mind that I'm at a 8.2 meter telescope, TMT which is being constructed is a 30 meter telescope.

There are currently no good ways to completely check a star for a planet the mass of Earth that is far enough from its star to be habitable. The longer answer is: probably not, based on what kind of stars we can see at night. \n\nIf you're looking up from any decently-sized human settlement in the northern hemisphere most of the stars you can see are either very massive (e.g., Vega) or are giant stars (e.g., Betelgeuse). Based on our current ideas of planetary and stellar evolution, it is extremely unlikely that anything resembling Earth and with life exists around these stars.\n\nIf you go to a dark-sky site, where you would be able to see fainter stars, then you would be able to see nearby solar-like stars at 4th or 5th magnitude, like Tau Ceti, Sigma Draconis, or Beta CVn. Those have a decent chance of having an Earth-sized planet (and some do! Like Tau Ceti, or 61 Virginis), but we haven't searched all of them well enough to know if there is an Earth there for sure.

The spectrograph breaks up the incoming light into its components wavelengths, and we look for known spectral lines within the total spectrum of light coming from that star (or other object - this works with nebulae and galaxies as well, though sometimes there are emission lines and sometimes absorption lines, depending on what we're looking at).  Certain lines correspond to certain ionized states of certain atoms or molecules.\n\nJust like the Doppler effect with sound, if a star (or other body) is moving toward us or away from us, the wavelengths of the light coming from it will be either compressed or extended, respectively.  When sound gets compressed, its pitch goes higher.  When light gets compressed, it shifts towards the blue.  Likewise, when sound gets drawn out, its pitch goes lower; and with light, it shifts toward the red end of the spectrum.\n\nWe take the image from our spectrograph and look at where the lines actually occur versus where they should be if the remote object were stationary relative to us.  Based on where the lines are versus where we'd expect them to be, we can tell both whether the object is moving toward or away from us and how quickly it is moving.  We can separately analyze the spectral lines to see what the object is made of.  Red-shift and blue-shift don't really have much to do with the temperature or color of the star.</p>",

This missing matter does not seem to absorb or emit any electromagnetic radiation, so it is completely see-through and invisible, yet makes up a major portion of the mass - and we don't know yet what it is. There are also theories that postulate that there is no such thing as dark matter, but that the laws of gravity that we know no longer hold at these scales.\n\nExtraterestial life - we're starting to discover thousands of extra-teresstial planets around other stars. And we're getting better at determining their mass, distance from the star, and other factors that could tell us if they might be hospitable to (earthlike) life. And if we find such planets - would we find life on them? Intelligent life even?\n\nGravitational waves - the acceleration of large masses should cause gravitational waves. These could be detected and give us a completely new window on the universe. One possible way of detecting them is to accurately measure the arrival times of very stable pulsars over a long time. Small changes in these arrival times could be due to the expansion and contraction of space itself between the pulsars and us due to gravitational waves. Pulsar timing is being actively researched by many radio astronomers and will be one of the missions of the upcoming SKA (Square Kilometer Array) radio telescope.\n\n\n\n</p>",

After looking at pictures on google, sun dogs seem to usually be splotches of light as opposed to the very distinct disk you photographed.\n\nLooking at a planetarium program on my computer, it looks as if Venus was in very near that position around 6pm today, so that would be my guess. </p>",

In the galactic bulge, for example, the rotational velocity starts out high, and then drops down to ~220 km/s near the inner edge of the disk.  This is because the way the mass distribution falls off is different in the bulge than in the outer disk, both for the baryons and for the dark matter.</p>",

Because that disk of dust was a disk, all in a plane, all of the planets formed in a plane as well.\n\nRings and disks are common in astronomy. When a cloud collapses, the conservation of angular momentum amplifies any initial tiny spin of the cloud. As the cloud spins faster and faster, it collapses into a disk, which is the maximal balance between gravitational collapse and centrifugal force created by rapid spin. The result is the coplanar planets...\n\nSource: [Curious About Astronomy](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=205)</p>",

A cloud may start with any size or shape, and different clumps of gas within the cloud may be moving in random directions at random speeds. These clumps collide and merge as the cloud collapses, and each new clump has the average velocity of the clumps that formed it. In this way, the random motions of the original cloud become more orderly as the cloud collapses, changing the cloud from its original lumpy shape into a rotating, flattened disk with nearly circular orbits. This process does indeed conserve angular momentum, for the rotating disk still has the same total angular momentum as the original cloud. \n</p>",

So it's all about how fast Curiosity can deliver back to MRO and Odyssey. Then, Odyssey's the slower, older, and more distant-from-Curiosity of the two.\n\nJPL says that MRO flyovers last 8 minutes, and \"in that time, between 100 and 250 megabits of data can be transmitted to an orbiter. \" It depends on the clarity of the signal and the height of the flyover. Then there are about 2 to 4 flyovers a day.\n\nSo at a minimum, roughly 200 Mbit/day; at maximum, 1 Gbit/day.\n\nThis averages out to ~0.3 to ~1.5kb/sec on average.\n\n* http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/rover/communications/\n* http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/communicationwithearth/data/</p>",

For example I'm currently doing a PhD in Exoplanet research at a UK university. My background is undergraduate in physics and a masters in engineering.\n\nOn the other hand you can just buy an amateur telescope and do some backyard astronomy! The most fun I've had is trying to get an old, manual rusty scope to observe the planets and you get a real buzz when a fuzzy orange blob suddenly resolves into Jupiter and some moons.\n\nIf you're serious in doing this for your job you shouldn't be disillusioned in that 'anybody' can just do it so long as you have a can-do attitude. In the UK there simply isn't the funding to just hand out research grants to everyone who asks for it. You'll require some formal science degree, usually in the physical sciences (physics, chemistry, engineering) and in general the entry route as a career is via a PhD.\n\nAfter that a lot of people stay in research as post-docs, or move to companies that operate large observatories such as ESO, Keck, VLT, VLA etc, or will leave to pursue a career in industry.\n\nFor you I'd get in touch with any local universities to see if they offer any astronomy/physics courses you're eligible for, and also seek out advice from a careers center. Also keep asking here for more advice!\n\nGood luck :)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>An allegory:\n\nImagine you have a dog. It's a corgi and you're [one of those people](https://www.reddit.com/r/corgi) who's just nuts about corgis. You absolutely live for this thing. So it's your main question in life to figure out if anyone else in your city has a corgi too, because maybe someday you'd like to go over and pet it. That might be hard because it's a big city, but the first step is just to find out if there are any other corgis out there.\n\nUnfortunately the only way you can find out about other dogs is by peering in the windows of your neighbors who live on your street. This is inconvenient because you're really limited by the number of houses that you can see into, and even if you could see in and they did have a dog, if the dog isn't sitting right in front of the window you won't see it. \n\nHowever after doing some searching ([including a big effort where you stare at just a few people's houses for days on end to see if a dog runs in front of the window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_\\(spacecraft\\))) you can come to some conclusions.\n \n * [A lot of people have at least one dog.](http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/)\n * [Some people have many dogs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiplanetary_systems)\n * [Some people keep animals in their house that you never even thought were an option.](http://discovermagazine.com/galleries/zen-photo/h/heavens-and-hells) Raccoons and that kind of thing. Even if you had the ability to pet them I'm not sure you would want to.\n * [And there are at least a few other corgis out there!](http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-discovers-first-earth-size-planet-in-the-habitable-zone-of-another-star)\n\nThat's exciting news that they're out there at all, but now the question is how common they are. Then the latest news comes that in your search you find out your nearest nextdoor neighbor has a corgi, too. So either you're astronomically lucky, and corgis are rare but you two happen to live next door to each other -- or maybe corgis are super common. Maybe pretty much all houses have a corgi living in them. This is very good news for your long-term goal of petting other corgis.\n\nIn the short term, not a whole lot has changed. You're not going to go pet your neighbor's dog anytime soon. In the meantime we have some options:\n\n * Continue the search of the neighborhood to investigate the diversity of dogs and try to push the seach area bigger to get better statistics. We haven't come close to looking everywhere that we're technically able to look, so we can keep this project going for a long time.\n * [Try shouting at the neighbor's corgi](http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/broadcasting-message) to see if it's smart and can do any tricks. It might not listen though, and if it didn't do a trick, it doesn't necessarily mean it's dumb. You shout at your own dog sometimes and it doesn't do the trick, so we know it's hard to tell a smart corgi from a dumb one.\n * Work on new ways to keep watching the dogs we already know are there. This could mean spending more time staring in your neighbor's window, but also developing new technology to do a better job. [Maybe some kind of thermal camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope) that would let us watch the corgi when it's not right by the window. Maybe we would find out that our neighbor has some other dogs or even raccoons, which would raise even more questions. Do all houses in this city have a raccoon living in them? Where did these people even get all their animals in the first place?\n\nTL;DR -- You're not going to pet your neighbor's dog anytime soon. What's important is that you know they have a nice dog, just like you. Maybe everyone has a nice dog?</p>",

I think that's arguable. It's one exoplanet out of many. It being so close may allow us to measure some properties about it in the bear future that we may not be able to otherwise. It's unclear right now, especially since the discovery was just announced. But I think the key point is that the discovery is exciting. It makes people care about science. It gives them hope for the future, that we as a species are really capable of figuring these kinds of things out.

Then, both stars would orbit a common center of mass well outside the star and we would see a huge amount of Doppler shift in spectral lines from the back and forth motion of the star in its orbit and the original paper did not see evidence of any close in binary (possibly one very far out but it wasn't determined for certain).\n\nIn addition, the eclipsing effect is actually incredibly small. A 1.4 solar mass black hole has a Schwarzschild radius of about 4.2 km. Let's add in a factor of 10 in terms of light blockage to account for any possible spacetime warping. The area of the circle is [5500 km^2](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi*42^2). The radius of the star is about 1.6 solar radii, or about [1.1 million km](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.6+*+solar+radius+in+km). The area of that circle is [3.8e12 km^2](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi*%281.1e6%29^2). So you're talking about a [1 part in a billion](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5500+%2F+3.8e12) dip in the light curve.\n\nThe factor of 10 is a fudge factor. At about 10 Schwarzschild radii away from a black hole, you're sort of in more or less flat enough spacetime. You can see that even if I bump that up by *another* factor of 10 (so another factor of 100 on the area), it won't bring you anywhere close to 22%.\n\nThere is [evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03256) that the dips are related to a long-term decline in the lightcurve, which is also not explainable for a standard F star. It's a bit of an Occam's Razor type approach.

                "answer": "<p>I'll take a stab.\n\nFirst - you are mistaken that *we can look in the direction the BB did not come from*, as that implies that the universe was born in *space*. This is a misconception.\n\nThe big bang **is** space. It is the entire universe.  (If we want to ponder 'where' the big bang took place, that would deal with cosmological hypothesis such as 2D Branes in M-Theory, or Special Black Hole Hypothesis, etc).\n\nSo the question then becomes - what shape is the universe?  Or rather, what it the topology of the universe.\n\n[This wiki article may help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe)\n\nIs the universe infinite?  Or is it finite?  Closed? Or open?\n\nOne way to think of this is how parallel lines travel over great distances.  They may appear parallel to us over small distances, but if they converge, or fall away from each other over vast distances, that would indicate a curvature (positive or negative) to the universe.\n\nAll current observations *confirm that the observable universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.*\n\nThe big bang created ALL of space, and it is undergoing accelerated expansion (due to dark energy).\n\nIf the universe is not infinite, it would mean that given enough time you could travel in a straight line and eventually end up at your starting point.\n\nIt would also mean that it might be possible to see a reflection in the universe (this has been looked for and has not been observed).\n\nIf the universe is infinite, then there is no center.\n\nHere is a way to think of this.  Consider a balloon as our universe. You may *think* you are living inside the balloon at some position.\n\nBut let's say that instead, we live on the surface of the balloon, and our perception is simply a projection of that surface into the interior.\n\nFrom the aspect of being on the surface, where is the center?\n\nThe correct answer is every point on the surface of the sphere is the center, from that points perspective.\n\nNow, the universe is not the surface of a sphere, but an infinite topology has the same condition.  There is no center.  However, every point on the topology is the center from that points view.\n\nThe term *observational sphere* is the maximum we can see in any direction due to the limits of light speed and the size of the universe.\n\nIf you are a light year to the right of me, you would see 1 light year more to your right than I can.  Likewise I would see 1 light year to the left, more than you can.  Each of us is the center point of our observational sphere.\n\nEdit: I didn't answer your *could we look far enough and not find galaxies* - to a degree, yes.  However, not for the reason you think.  Remember that distance translates to time.  The farther you look, the farther in the past you are seeing.  We can not see, with optical telescopes, past 380,000 years after the Big Bang because light could not persist until then.  However, the first stars did not form until hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang.  Thus indeed, it is possible for us to *see* before galaxies were born (by studying the CMB) - however, it is not possible for us to see back to the big bang using optical techniques.\n\nEdit 2: Let me take another stab at showing the concept of an infinite structure with no center.\n\nTo do this you will need:\n\n* A thread, about 2 feet long\n* Masking tape (or similar)\n\nJoin and tape the ends of the thread such that you now have a ring of thread.\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n* The thread ring **is** the universe.  Only the ring is the universe, nothing else.\n* The space between the ring is not part of the universe. Only the thread ring is the universe.\n\nThis shape can be considered infinite, as the ring can grow infinitely in any dimension without changing shape (overall topology).\n\nYou are at some point on this thread.\n\nWhere is the center?  Remember, the empty space inside and outside the thread is not the universe. Only the thread is the universe.\n\nCorrect, there is no center. However, each point on the ring is the center from that points view.\n\n</p>",

Our 3D universe is like the 2-dimensional *surface* of the ball. The big bang happend everywhere, because 'everywhere' is 'somewhere' on the surface of that ball.

Our language allows us to say things like this, but they don't mean anything.\n\nIf you think of the universe as **only the surface** of a ball, you should be able to figure out the answers to your questions, and, crucially, understand why they are as they are.\n\n*PS: In /u/KaneHau's post things like \"shape of the universe\" have a very specific, mathematical meaning which don't have anything to do with our little ball analogy, and he just generally touches on waaay more advanced/subtle stuff which might confuse the matter, rather than help clearing it up.*</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Hey, \n\nyou should get the freeware program [stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/). It's very intuitive to use and helps alot, because you can frame constellations, search for objects and many more. \n\nWith that program it should be easy to find some basic constellations like the [winter hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Hexagon), the [southern cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux) the [summer triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Triangle) and related objects. \n\nThe southern cross extended five times towards the south  shows the celestial south pole, the back of the big dipper do the same for the celestial north pole.The big dipper is best visible around March to may At the moment you can use Cassiopeia to determine the celestial north pole. \n\nOrion lies right on the celestial equator, right between the the poles and should be visible overhead from you location at given times. With the winter hexagon you should figure out the other winter constellations like Taurus, Gemini, Auriga, Canis Majoris and Canis Minoris. \n\nProceed from there over the celestial equator and the ecliptic. You'll get skilled in finding more and more stars over time. It's really not that hard when you've learned the basics. As time goes by, just move along with identifying bright stars as the sky changes. \n\nUsing common binoculars you should be able to detect some fine objects like the coathanger [Collinder 399](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocchi%27s_Cluster), [Omega Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Centauri) and various bright members of the [Messier catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Messier_objects). \n\nThe summer triangle is still visible in the early evening from your position, the winter hexagon around midnight and the \"ship\" in the early morning. Just use look it up in stellarium, and you'll get what this is all about. \n</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Do you have a set of binoculars? If not get some.  You will be amazed at how how much you can see with a cheap pair of bins. Celestron makes a 15x70 set that are about $65 on Amazon. Use a guide for binocular observing like this one http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/binocular.pdf (there are many others).\n\nYou also want a good software. Stellarium as was mentioned is awesome and free. Something more portable might be good also if you have a smartphone. SkySafari is the best for IOS in my opinion. It has a red screen feature so it won't kill your night vision and is available in three different price points. The advantage of the smartphone apps is the ability to use the compass/gps to easily identify what you are looking at. Good software like SkySafari will also let you read about what you are seeing. \n\nSo get some bins, a smartphone or laptop, and a bit of software. Find a dark spot away from city lights and maybe a friend who shares your interest and just spend time looking and identifying what you see. If you enjoy it you eventually will find an astronomy group and invest in a telescope to take it to the next level. </p>",
