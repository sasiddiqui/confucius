<p>I have a background in Computer Engineering and have been working on developing better algorithms to mimic human thought. (One of my favorites is Analogical Modeling as applied to language processing and decision making.) However, the more I research, the more I realize just <em>how</em> complicated AI is.</p>

<p>I have tried to tackle many problems in this field, but sometimes I find that I am reinventing the wheel or am trying to solve a problem that has already been proven to be unsolvable (ie. the halting problem). So, to help in furthering AI, I want to better understand the current obstacles that are hindering our progress in this field.</p>

<p>For example, time and space complexity of some machine learning algorithms is super-polynomial which means that even with fast computers, it can take a while for the program to complete.

<p>So given the 3 inputs: 1st number, operator sign represented by the number (1 - <code>+</code>, 2 - <code>-</code>, 3 - <code>/</code>, 4 - <code>*</code>, and so on), and the 2nd number, then after training the network should give me the valid results.</p>

<p>Example 1 (<code>2+2</code>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Input 1: <code>2</code>; Input 2: <code>1</code> (<code>+</code>); Input: <code>2</code>; Expected output: <code>4</code></li>
<li>Input 1: <code>10</code>; Input 2: <code>2</code> (<code>-</code>); Input: <code>10</code>; Expected output: <code>0</code></li>
<li>Input 1: <code>5</code>; Input 2: <code>4</code> (<code>*</code>); Input: <code>5</code>; Expected output: <code>25</code></li>
<li>and so</li>
</ul>

<p>The above can be extended to more sophisticated examples.</p>

<p>Is that possible? If so, what kind of network can learn/achieve that?</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mirror neurons are related to imitation learning, a very useful feature that is missing in current real-world A.I. implementations. Instead of learning from input-output examples (supervised learning) or from rewards (reinforcement learning), an agent with mirror neurons would be able to learn by simply observing other agents, translating their movements to its own coordinate system. What do we have on this subject regarding computational models?</p>

<p>If I have a paragraph I want to summarize, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ponzo and Fila went to the mall during the day. They walked for a long while, stopping at shops. They went to many shops. At first, they didn't buy anything. After going to a number of shops, they eventually bought a shirt, and a pair of pants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Better summarized as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They shopped at the mall today and bought some clothes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the best AI strategy to automate this process, if there is one? If there isn't, is it because it would be dependent on first having an external information resource that would inform any algorithm? Or is it because the problem is inherently contextual?</p>

<p>With which neural network it is possible to scale the learning between the independent networks?</p>

<p>For example given the stream of images one network is trained to recognise cats, another dogs, and so on, all of them are talking to the main visual network which is responsible for making some decision and pass the analysis to the main <dic>brain<dic> network.

In other words, something like a robot.</p>

<p>Which type of network would be the most suitable and scalable for such configuration, so you can easily extend it for additional separate network modules? Does it matter which type of deep network (or not deep) I should choose, or not?</p>

<p>This has everything to do with the <em>platform</em>, i.e. the way that the representation would be coded in.

<p>The 'page' in this context isn't a document page, but it's part of the phrase.</p></li>
<li><p>'I'm living in Reading.'</p>

<p>The 'Reading' is a city (noun), so it's not a verb. Otherwise it doesn't make any sense. Checking for the capital letter would work in that specific example, but it won't work for other (like 'make' can be either verb or noun).</p></li>
<li><p>'I've read something on the Facebook wall, do you want to know what?'</p>

<p>Currently, many different organizations do cutting-edge AI research, and some innovations are shared freely (at a time lag) while others are kept private. I'm referring to this state of affairs as 'multipolar,' where instead of there being one world leader that's far ahead of everyone else, there are many competitors who can be mentioned in the same breath. (There's not only one academic center of AI research worth mentioning, there might be particularly hot companies but there's not only one worth mentioning, and so on.)</p>

<p>But we could imagine instead there being one institution that mattered when it comes to AI (be it a company, a university, a research group, or a non-profit). This is what I'm referring to as <dic>monolithic.<dic> Maybe they have access to tools and resources no one else has access to, maybe they attract the best and brightest in a way that gives them an unsurmountable competitive edge, maybe returns to research compound in a way that means early edges can't be overcome, maybe they have some sort of government coercion preventing competitors from popping up. (For other industries, network or first-mover effects might be other good examples of why you would expect that industry to be monolithic instead of multipolar.)</p>

<p>It seems like we should be able to use insights from social sciences like economics or organizational design or history of science in order to figure out, if not which path seems more likely, <em>how we would know</em> which path seems more likely.</p>

<p>(For example, we may be able to measure how much returns to research compound, in the sense of one organization coming up with an insight meaning that organization is likely to come up with the next relevant insight, and knowing this number makes it easier to figure out where the boundary between the two trajectories is located.)</p>

<p>How likely AI can fully replace pilots on commercial flights (including take off, landing and parking)?</p>

<p>Since we've self-driving cars already, is it likely to happen to commercial planes as well?</p>

<p>How much processing power is needed to emulate the human brain? More specifically, the neural simulation, such as communication between the neurons and processing certain data in real-time.</p>

<p><strong>The Situation:</strong>
A self-driving car is traveling at it's maximum speed, 25 mph (40 km/h), in the middle of an empty street with the ability to change lanes on both sides. There are two passengers, one in the front and another in the back.</p>

<p>Someone jumps from the side of the road directly into the path of the car. A collision would occur in 50 meters. <a href=<dic>http://www.brake.org.uk/rsw/15-facts-a-resources/facts/1255-speed<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>Breaking distance</a> at this speed is about 24m.</p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong> Is it known how the current implementation of the Google Car AI would react, or is it currently a matter of speculation? A step-by-step explanation of the AI's decisioning process would be preferred.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> The car could activate its brakes immediately, coming to a halt as quickly as possible. This would be sooner than a human could stop, as people require time to recognize the possibility of a collision, and then physically slam on the brake. (<em>thinking distance</em>).</p>

<p>Alternatively, the car could continue traveling forward, processing the situation. (Similar to a humans <em>thinking distance</em>). The person may continue to move, either out of the way, or still into danger of being hit. In this case, the car may decide to change lanes in an attempt to pass around the person.</p>

<p>Lastly and most unlikely, the car will not alter its course and proceed to drive forward.</p>

<p>Isaac Asimov's famous <a href=<dic>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics<dic>>Three Laws of Robotics</a> originated in the context of Asimov's science fiction stories. In those stories, the three laws serve as a safety measure, in order to avoid untimely or manipulated situations from exploding in havoc.</p>

<p>More often than not, Asimov's narratives would find a way to break them, leading the writer to make several modifications to the laws themselves.

<p>First of all it requires huge amounts of computing power, time and effort to train the algorithm the right way and adding extra layers doesn't really help to solve complex problems which cannot be easily predicted.</p>

<p>Secondly some tasks are extremely difficult or impossible to solve using DNN, like solving a <a href=<dic>http://ai.stackexchange.com/q/154/8<dic>>math</a> equations, predicting <a href=<dic>http://ai.stackexchange.com/q/225/8<dic>>pseudo-random lists</a>, <a href=<dic>http://ai.stackexchange.com/q/168/8<dic>>fluid mechanics</a>, guessing encryption algorithms, or <a href=<dic>http://ai.stackexchange.com/q/205/8<dic>>decompiling</a> unknown formats, because there is no simple mapping between input and output.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong><br>
Why zero-sum perfect information games satisfy the conditions of Von Neumann's theorem?<br>
If we relax the rules to be non-zero-sum or non-perfect information, how would the conditions change?</p>

<p>In October 2014, Dr. Mark Riedl published an approach to testing AI intelligence, called <a href=<dic>http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6142v3.pdf<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>the <dic>Lovelace Test 2.0<dic></a>, after being inspired by the <a href=<dic>http://kryten.mm.rpi.edu/lovelace.pdf<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>original Lovelace Test</a> (published in 2001). Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.</p>

<p>The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>a must create an artifact o of type t;</p></li>
  <li><p>o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is
  any criterion expressible in natural language;</p></li>
  <li><p>a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied
  that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and</p></li>
  <li><p>a human referee r determines the combination of t and C
  to not be unrealistic for an average human.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to <em>compare</em> the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.</p>

<p>However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result).</p>

<p>With typical machine learning you would usually use a training data-set to create a model of some kind, and a testing data-set to then test the newly created model. For something like linear regression after the model is created with the training data you now have an equation that you would use to predict the outcome of the set of features in the testing data. You would then take the prediction that the model returned and compare that to the actual data in the testing set. How would a validation set be used here?</p>

<p>With nearest neighbor you would use the training data to create an n-dimensional space that has all the features of the training set.

<p>Is it possible to create a Strong AI that does not rely on learning by reinforcement, or is reinforcement learning a requirement for artificial intelligence?

<p>I'm playing with an LSTM to generate text. In particular, this one:</p>

<p><a href=<dic>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchollet/keras/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchollet/keras/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py</a></p>

<p>It works on quite a big demo text set from Nietzsche and says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you try this script on new data, make sure your corpus
  has at least ~100k characters. ~1M is better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This pops up a couple of questions.</p>

<p>A.) If all I want is an AI with a very limited vocabulary where the generate text should be short sentences following a basic pattern.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<p><em>I like blue sky with white clouds</em></p>

<p><em>I like yellow fields with some trees</em></p>

<p><em>I like big cities with lots of bars</em></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Would it then be reasonable to use a much much smaller dataset?</p>

<p>B.) If the dataset really needs to be that big. What if I just repeat the text over and over to reach the recommended minimum? If that would work though, I'd be wondering how that is any different from just taking more iterations of learning with the same shorter text?</p>

<p>Obviously I can play with these two questions myself and in fact I am experimenting with it. One thing I already figured out is that with a shorter text following a basic pattern I can get to a very very low ( ~0.04) quite fast but the predicted text just turns out as gibberish.</p>

<p>My naive explanation for that would be that there are just not enough samples to proof against whether the gibberish actually makes sense or not? But then again I wonder if more iterations or duplicating the content would actually help.</p>

<p>I'm trying to experiment with these questions myself so please don't think I'm just too lazy and are aiming for others to do the work. I'm just looking for more experienced people to give me a better understanding of the mechanics that influence these things.</p>

<p>For example I would like to implement transparent AI in the RTS game which doesn't offer any AI API (like old games), and I'd like to use image recognition algorithm for detecting the objects which can talks to another algorithm which is responsible for the logic.</p>

<p>Given I'd like to use two neural networks, what are the approaches to setup the communication between them? Is it just by exporting result findings of the first algorithm (e.g. using CNN) with list of features which were found on the screen, then use it as input for another network? Or it's more complex than that, or I need to have more than two networks?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boltzmann machines can be seen as the stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield nets.</p>

<p>Both are recurrent neural networks that can be trained to learn of bit patterns. Then when presented with a partial pattern, the net will retrieve the full complete pattern.</p>

<p>Hopfield networks have been proven to have a capacity of 0.138 (e.g. approximately 138 bit vectors can be recalled from storage for every 1000 nodes, Hertz 1991).</p>

<p>As a Boltzmann machine is stochastic, my understanding is that it would not necessarily always show the same pattern when the energy difference between one stored pattern and another is similar.

<p>When it comes to neural networks, it's often only explained what abstract task they do, say for example detect a number in an image. I never understood what's going on under the hood essentially.</p>

<p>There seems to be a common structure of a directed graph, with values in each node. Some nodes are input nodes. Their values can be set. The values of subsequent nodes are then calculated based on those along the edges of the graph until the values for the output nodes are set, which can be interpreted a result.</p>

<p>How exactly is the value of each node determined? I assume that some formula is associated with each node that takes all incoming nodes as input to calculate the value of the node. What formula is used? Is the formula the same throughout the network?</p>

<p>I'm trying to teach an AI different pattern of tic tac toe to recognize wether a given pattern represents a win or not.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it's not learning to recognize them correctly and I think may way of representing/encoding the game into vectors is wrong.</p>

<p>I choose a way that is easy for an human (me, in particular!) to make sense of:</p>

                           0,0,0],
                          [0,0,1,
                           0,1,0,
                           0,0,1],

                           0,1,0,

target_data = np.array([[0],[0],[1],[1]], <dic>float32<dic>)
</code></pre>

<p>This basically just use an array of length 9 to represent a 3 x 3 board. The first three items represent the first row, the next three the second row and so on. The line breaks should make it obvious I guess.</p>

<p>The target data then maps the first two game states to <dic>no wins<dic> and the last two game states to <dic>wins<dic>.</p>

<p>Then I wanted to create some validation data that is slightly different to see if it generalizes.</p>

<pre><code>validation_data = np.array([[0,0,0,

                            [1,0,0,
                             0,1,0,
                             1,0,0],
                            [1,0,0,
                             0,1,0,
                             0,0,1],
                            [0,0,1,
                             0,0,1,
                             0,0,1]], <dic>float32<dic>)
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, again the last two game states should be <dic>wins<dic> whereas the first two should not.</p>

<p>Has there any research been done on how difficult certain languages are to learn for chatbots? 
For example, CleverBot knows a bit of Dutch, German, Finnish and French, so there are clearly chatbots that speak other languages than English. (English is still her best language, but that is because she speaks that most often)</p>

<p>I would imagine that a logical constructed language, like lobjan, would be easier to learn than a natural language, like English, for example.  </p>

<p>The above question itself is perhaps too broad for this forum, hence I am phrasing it as a request for references.</p>

<p>Humans have been endowed with personalities by nature, and it is not clear (to me at least) if this is a feature or a bug. This has been explored in science fiction by various notions of <a href=<dic>http://memory-alpha.org/Borg<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>Borg</a>-like entities. It is my belief that, for narrative reasons, such stories usually end with the humans with their flawed personalities winning in the end. </p>

<p>Are there experts who have analyzed, perhaps mathematically, design criteria for an AI agent with weakly enforced goals (eg. to maximize reproduction in the human case) in an uncertain environment, and ended up with the answer that a notion of personality is useful? If there are philosophers or science fiction writers who have examined this question in their work, I would be happy to know about those too.</p>

<p>In a <a href=<dic>http://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-next-for-artificial-intelligence-1465827619<dic>>recent Wall Street Journal article</a>, Yann LeCunn makes the following statement:</p>

  <p>The next step in achieving human-level ai is creating intelligent—but not autonomous—machines. The AI system in your car will get you safely home, but won’t choose another destination once you’ve gone inside. From there, we’ll add basic drives, along with emotions and moral values. If we create machines that learn as well as our brains do, it’s easy to imagine them inheriting human-like qualities—and flaws. </p>

<p>Personally, I have generally taken the position that talking about emotions for artificial intelligences is silly, because there would be no <em>reason</em> to create AI's that experience emotions.

<p>I'm trying to come up with the right algorithm for a system in which the user enters a few symptoms and the system has to predict or determine the likelihood that a few selected symptoms are associated with those existing in the system. Then after associating them, the result or output should be a specific disease for the symptoms.</p>

<p>The system is comprised of a series of diseases with each assigned to specific symptoms, which also exist in the system.</p>

<p>Let's assume that the user entered the following input:</p>

<pre><code>A, B, C, and D
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing the system should do is check and associate each symptom (in this case represented by alphabetical letters) individually against a data-table of symptoms that already exist. And in cases where the input doesn't exist, the system should report or send feedback about it.</p>

<p>And also, let's say that <code>A and B</code> was in the data-table, so we are 100% sure that they're valid or exist and the system is able to give out the disease based on the input. Then let's say that the input now is <code>C and D</code> where <code>C</code> doesn't exist in the data-table, but there is a possibility that <code>D</code> exists.</p>

<p>We don't give <code>D</code> a score of 100%, but maybe something lower (let's say 90%). Then <code>C</code> just doesn't exist at all in the data-table. So, <code>C</code> gets a score of 0%.</p>

<p>Therefore, the system should have some kind of association and prediction techniques or rules to output the result by judging the user's input.</p>

<p>Summary of generating the output:</p>

<p>I have gone through the <a href=<dic>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_relational_learning<dic>>wikipedia explanation of SRL</a>. But, it only confused me more:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Statistical relational learning (SRL) is a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence and machine learning that is concerned with domain models that exhibit both uncertainty (which can be dealt with using statistical methods) and complex, relational structure.</p>

<p>The obvious solution is to ensure that the training data is balanced - but in my particular case that is impossible. What corrections can one perform in such a scenario?</p>

<p>I know that my training data is heavily biased towards a particular class, say, and I cannot change that. Moreover, the labels are very noisy. Conditioned on this piece of information, is there anything I can do by tweaking the training process itself/ something else, to correct for the bias in the training data?</p>

<p>The data comes from an experiment (from an electron microscope), and I cannot collect more data. It's always going to be biased in this way, so alternatively-biased is also not an option. I'm sorry that I'm unable to provide any more details due to confidentiality.</p>

<p>I'm going to be entering a masters computer science program in the fall, and I wanted to move towards a concentration in computational neuroscience and linguistics for AI development applications. While I have a math and CS background, I have almost no biology/neuroscience background, and my linguistics background is limited to the random research I've done in my spare time to satiate my curiosities.</p>

<p>What are good non-math and CS related topics to study for these fields? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weizenbaum tells us that he was shocked by the experience of releasing ELIZA (also known as <dic>Doctor<dic>) to the nontechnical staff at the MIT AI Lab. Secretaries and nontechnical administrative staff thought the machine was a <dic>real<dic> therapist, and spent hours revealing their personal problems to the program. When Weizenbaum informed his secretary that he, of course, had access to the logs of all the conversations, she reacted with outrage at this invasion of her privacy. Weizenbaum was shocked by this and similar incidents to find that such a simple program could so easily deceive a naive user into revealing personal information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia's article on the <a href=<dic>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>><dic>ELIZA Effect<dic></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though designed strictly as a mechanism to support <dic>natural language conversation<dic> with a computer, ELIZA's DOCTOR script was found to be surprisingly successful in eliciting emotional responses from users who, in the course of interacting with the program, began to ascribe understanding and motivation to the program's output. As Weizenbaum later wrote, <strong><dic>I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.<dic></strong> Indeed, ELIZA's code had not been designed to evoke this reaction in the first place. Upon observation, researchers discovered users unconsciously assuming ELIZA's questions implied interest and emotional involvement in the topics discussed, <em>even when they consciously knew that ELIZA did not simulate emotion.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>ELIZA, despite its simplicity, was incredibly successful at its task of tricking other human beings. Even those who knew ELIZA was a bot would still talk to it. Obviously, ELIZA served as an inspiration for various other, more intelligent chatbots, such as <a href=<dic>http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/for-sympathetic-ear-more-chinese-turn-to-smartphone-program.html?_r=0<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>Xiaoice</a>.

<p>A system makes a decision basing on a large number of <em>varied</em> factors, following a <dic>live<dic> decision tree - one that is (independently, through other subsystem) updated with new decisions, new situations.</p>

<p>The individual decisions can be recorded as a kind of structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>decision function</li>
<li>node to activate if decision is positive</li>
<li>node to activate if decision is negative</li>
</ul>

<p>and a node can be another decision record, or a conclusion.</p>

<p>This isn't entirely a binary tree, as many decisions may lead to the same conclusion - each node has two children, but may have many parents.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no problem storing the tree in memory - it can be database records or entries of a map, or just a list. It's perfectly sufficient for the machine.</p>

<p>The problem here is building the subsystem that expands the decision tree - and in particular, having a human operator understand the structure being built, to be able to tune, guide, fix, adjust it: <strong>debugging the AI learning process.</strong></p>

<p>The question is: how to represent that data in a human-readable way, that emphasizes the flow of the graph?</p>

<p>a non-working example of the answer is <a href=<dic>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>Concept map</a> - in this case it only goes so far; with more than thirty or so nodes, it becomes a jumbled mess, especially if the number of cross-connections (multiple parents) becomes significant.

<p>An AI box is a (physical) barrier preventing an AI from using too much of his environment to accomplish his final goal.

<p>AI systems today are very capable machines, and recently the area of Natural Language Processing and Response has been exploding with innovation, as well as the fundamental algorithmic structure of AI machines.</p>

<p>I am asking if, given these recent breakthroughs, have any AI systems been developed that are able to (preferably with some measure of success) knowingly lie to humans about facts that it knows?</p>

<p>Note, what I'm asking goes beyond the canonical discussions of the Turing Test. I'm asking of machines that can 'understand' facts and then formulate a lie against this fact, perhaps using other facts to produce a believable 'cover-up' as part of the lie.</p>

<p>E.G.: CIA supercomputer is stolen by spies and they try to use the computer to do things, but the computer keeps saying it's missing dependencies though it really isn't or gives correct-looking but wrong answers knowingly.

<p>I want to start with a scenario that got me thinking about how well MCTS can perform:
Let's assume there is a move that is not yet added to the search tree. It is some layers/moves too deep. But if we play this move the game is basically won. However let's also assume that <em>all</em> moves that could be taken instead at the given game state are very very bad. For the sake of argument let's say there are 1000 possible moves and only one of them is good (but very good) and the rest is very bad. Wouldn't MCTS fail to recognize this and <em>not</em> grow the search tree towards this move and also rate this subtree very badly? 
I know that MCTS eventually converges to minimax (and eventually it will build the whole tree if there is enough memory). Then it should know that the move is good even though there are many bad possiblities. But I guess in practice this is not something that one can rely on.
Maybe someone can tell me if this is a correct evaluation on my part.</p>

<p>Apart from this special scenario I'd also like to know if there are other such scenarios where MCTS will perform badly (or extraordinary well). </p>

<p>I'm reading such nonsense about how an AI would turn the world into a supercomputer to solve a problem that it thought it needed to solve. That wouldn't be AI. That's procedural programming stuck in some loop nonsense. An AI would need to evolve and re-organise its neurons.

<p>Just for fun, I am trying to develop a neural network.</p>

<p>Now, for backpropagation I saw two techniques.</p>

<p>The first one is used <a href=<dic>http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599/01wi/admin/Assignments/bpn.html<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>here</a> and in many other places too.</p>

<p>What it does is:</p>

<ul>
<li>It computes the error for each output neuron.</li>
<li>It backpropagates it into the network (calculating an error for each inner neuron).</li>
<li>It updates the weights with the formula: <img src=<dic>http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20w_%7Bl%2Cm%2Cn%7D%20%3D%20k%20%5Ccdot%20E_%7Bl&plus;1%2Cn%7D%20%5Ccdot%20N_%7Bl%2Cm%7D<dic> alt=<dic><dic>> (where <img src=<dic>http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20w_%7Bl%2Cm%2Cn%7D<dic> alt=<dic><dic>> is the change in weight, <img src=<dic>http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?k<dic> alt=<dic><dic>> the learning speed, <img src=<dic>http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_%7Bl&plus;1%2Cn%7D<dic> alt=<dic><dic>> the error of the neuron receiving the input from the synapse and <img src=<dic>http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7Bl%2Cm%7D<dic> alt=<dic><dic>> being the output sent on the synapse).</li>
<li>It repeats for each entry of the dataset, as many times as required.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the neural network proposed in <a href=<dic>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&amp;list=PL77aoaxdgEVDrHoFOMKTjDdsa0p9iVtsR<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>this tutorial</a> (also available on GitHub) uses a different technique:</p>

<ul>
<li>It uses an error function (the other method does have an error function, but it does not use it for training).</li>
<li>It has another function which can compute the final error starting from the weights.</li>
<li>It minimizes that function (through gradient descent).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, which method should be used?</p>

<p>I think the first one is the most used one (because I saw different examples using it), but does it work as well?</p>

<p>In particular, I don't know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Isn't it more subject to local minimums (since it doesn't use quadratic functions)?</li>
<li>Since the variation of each weight is influenced by the output value of its output neuron, don't entries of the dataset which just happen to produce higher values in the neurons (not just the output ones) influence the weights more than other entries?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I do prefer the first technique, because I find it simpler to implement and easier to think about.</p>

<p>Though, if it does have the problems I mentioned (which I hope it doesn't), is there any actual reason to use it over the second method?</p>

<p>The English Language is not well-suited to talking about artificial intelligence, which makes it difficult for humans to communicate to each other about what an AI is actually <dic>doing<dic>. Thus, it may make more sense to use <dic>human-like<dic> terms to describe the actions of machinery, even when the internal properties of the machinery do not resemble the internal properties of humanity.</p>

<p>Anthropomorphic language had been used a lot in technology (see the Hacker's Dictionary definition of <a href=<dic>https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/jargon.html#Anthropomorphization<dic>>anthropomorphization</a>, which attempts to justify computer programmers' use of anthromporhic terms when describing technology), but as AI continues to advance, it may be useful to consider the tradeoffs of using anthropomorphic language in communicating to both technical audiences and non-technical audiences. How can we get a good handle on AI if we can't even describe what we're doing?</p>

<p>Suppose I want to develop an algorithm that display a list of related articles. There are two ways by which I can explain how the algorithm works to a layman:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Very Anthropomorphic</em> - The algorithm reads all the articles on a website, and display the articles that are very similar to the article you are looking at.</li>
<li><em>Very Technical</em> - The algorithm converts each article into a <dic>bag-of-words<dic>, and then compare the <dic>bag-of-words<dic> of each article to determine what articles share the most common words. The articles that share the most words in the bags are the ones that are displayed to the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, #2 may be more <dic>technically correct<dic> than #1. By detailing the implementation of the algorithm, it makes it easier for someone to understand how to <em>fix</em> the algorithm if it produces an output that we disagree with heavily.</p>

<p>But #1 is more readable, elegant, and easier to understand. It provides a general sense of <em>what</em> the algorithm is doing, instead of <em>how</em> the algorithm is doing it. By abstracting away the implementation details of how a computer <dic>reads<dic> the article, we can then focus on using the algorithm in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Should I, therefore, prefer to use the anthropomorphic language as emphasized by Statement #1? If not, why not?</p>

<p>P.S.: If the answer depends on the audience that I am speaking to (a non-technical audience might prefer #1, while a technical audience may prefer #2), then let me know that as well.</p>

<p>Considering the answers of <a href=<dic>http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/1314/how-powerful-a-computer-is-required-to-simulate-the-human-brain<dic>>this</a> question, emulating a human brain with the current computing capacity is currently impossible, but we aren't very far from it.</p>

<p>Note, 1 or 2 decades ago, similar calculations had similar results.</p>

<p>The clock frequency of the modern CPUs seem to be stopped, currently the miniaturization (-> mobile use), the RAM/cache improvement and the multi-core paralellization are the main lines of the development.</p>

<p>Ok, but what is the case with the analogous chips? In case of a NN, it is not a very big problem, if it is not very accurate, the NN would adapt to the minor manufacturing differences in its learning phase. And a single analogous wire can substitute a complex integer multiplication-division unit, while the whole surface of the analogous printed circuit could work parallel.</p>

<p>According to <a href=<dic>http://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/3993/do-analog-fpgas-exist<dic>>this</a> post, <dic>software rewirable<dic> analogous circuits, essentially <dic>analogous FPGAs<dic> already exist. Although the capacity of the FPGAs is highly below the capacity of the <a href=<dic>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>ASIC</a>s with the same size, maybe analogous chips for neural networks could also exist.</p>

<p>I suspect, if it is correct, maybe even the real human brain model wouldn't be too far. It would still require a massively parallel system of costly analogous NN chips, but it seems to me not impossible.</p>

<p>Could this idea work? Maybe there is even active research/development into this direction?</p>

<p>I recently finished Course on RL by David Silver (on YT) and thought about trying it out on simple application in Unity Game Engine, where I've built simple labyrint with ball and want to teach the ball to get from point A to point B in there while avoiding obstacles and fire (the place where you'll get burnt so big negative reward)</p>

<p>The problem I encountered while designing the whole thing (programming-wise) is: What is the correct (or at least good) way of representing the position in 2D space? It is continuous so I thought about representing it as feature vector consisting of [up, down, left, right, posX, posY] where direction is whether I am pressing button of moving in that direction in binary (or actions if you want) and pos are floats (0-1) representing normalized position from one corner on the plane where the whole map is. That would be accompanied by vector W that would represent the weights adjusted using Gradient Descent.</p>

<p>Question is: will this work?? I am asking for 2 reasons. One is that I am not so sure about that posX and posY since it can be 0 and if I multiply it by the weights vector then how could be resulting reward anything but 0? Second reason is that I am not sure if the actions should be part of the features. I mean, it makes sense to me but I could easily be very wrong since I am a beginner.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot guys in advance. If you have any more questions or think the problem is not described deeply enough just ask in the comments and I'll edit the question. :)</p>

<p>PS: I could just code it the way I think is right, but I also want to get gasp of designing applications on paper before coding them (project management).</p>

<p>I know that deepmind used deep Q learning (<a href=<dic>https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>DQN</a>) for its Atari game AI. It used a <a href=<dic>https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>conv neural network</a> (CNN) to approximate <code>Q(s,a)</code> from pixels instead of from a Q-table. I want to know how DQN converted input to an action. How many output did the CNN have? How did they train the neural network for prediction?</p>

<p>Here are the steps that I believe are happening inside DQN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) A game picture (a state) is send to CNN as input value</p>
  
  <p>2) CNN predicts an output as action (eg:left, right, shoot, etc)</p>
  
  <p>3) Simulator applies the predicted action and moves to new game state</p>
  
  <p>4) repeat step 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with my above logic is in <strong>step 2</strong>. CNN is used for predicting an action, but when is CNN trained for prediction? </p>

<p>I would prefer if you used less math for explanation.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>I want to add some more questions regarding the same topic</p>

<p>1) How reward is passed in the neural network? that is how neural network knows whether its output action obtained positive or negative reward?</p>

<p>I was think about AIs and how they would work, when I realised that I couldn't think of a way that an AI could be taught language. A child tends to learn language through associations of language and pictures to an object (e.g: people saying the word <code>dog</code> while around a dog, and later realising that  people say <code>a dog</code> and <code>a car</code> and learn what <code>a</code> means...). However, a text based AI couldn't use this method to learn, as they wouldn't have access to any sort of input device.</p>

<p>A <dic>general intelligence<dic> may be capable of learning a lot of different things, but possessing capability does not equal actually having it. The <dic>AGI<dic> must learn...and that learning process can take time. If you want an AGI to drive a car or play Go, you have to find some way of <dic>teaching<dic> it. Keep in mind that we have never built AGIs, so we don't know how long the training process can be, but it would be safe to assume pessimistic estimates.</p>

<p>Contrast that to a <dic>narrow intelligence<dic>. The narrow AI already knows how to drive a car or play Go. It has been programmed to be very excellent at one specific task. You don't need to worry about training the machine, because it has already been pre-trained.</p>

<p>A <dic>general intelligence<dic> seems to be more flexible than a <dic>narrow intelligence<dic>. You could buy an AGI and have it drive a car <em>and</em> play Go. And if you are willing to do more training, you can even teach it a new trick: <em>how to bake a cake</em>. I don't have to worry about unexpected tasks coming up, since the AGI will <em>eventually</em> figure out how to do it, given enough training time. I would have to wait a <em>long time</em> though.</p>

<p>A <dic>narrow intelligence<dic> appears to be <em>more efficient</em> at its assigned task, due to it being programmed specifically for that task. It knows exactly what to do, and doesn't have to waste time <dic>learning<dic> (unlike our AGI buddy here). Instead of buying one AGI to handle a bunch of different tasks poorly, I would rather buy a bunch of specialized narrow AIs. Narrow AI #1 drives cars, Narrow AI #2 plays Go, Narrow AI #3 bake cakes, etc. That being said, this is a very brittle approach, since if some unexpected task comes up, none of my narrow AIs would be able to handle it. I'm willing to accept that risk though.</p>

<p>But recently I have found one theory that introduces a novel interpretation of residual networks showing they are exponential ensembles:</p>

  <p><a href=<dic>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06431<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>><em>Residual Networks are Exponential Ensembles of Relatively Shallow Networks (2016)</em></a></p>

<p>Deep Resnets are described as many shallow networks whose outputs are pooled at various depths. 
There is a picture in the article. I attach it with explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=<dic>http://i.stack.imgur.com/PGhK2.jpg<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>><img src=<dic>http://i.stack.imgur.com/PGhK2.jpg<dic> alt=<dic>enter image description here<dic>></a> Residual Networks are
  conventionally shown as (a), which is a natural representation of
  Equation (1). When we expand this formulation to Equation (6), we
  obtain an unraveled view of a 3-block residual network (b). From this
  view, it is apparent that residual networks have O(2^n) implicit paths
  connecting input and output and that adding a block doubles the number
  of paths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion of the article it is stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It is not depth, but the ensemble that makes residual networks strong</strong>.
  Residual networks push the limits of network multiplicity, not network
  depth. Our proposed unraveled view and the lesion study show that
  residual networks are an implicit ensemble of exponentially many
  networks. If most of the paths that contribute gradient are very short
  compared to the overall depth of the network, <strong>increased depth</strong>
  alone <strong>can’t be the key characteristic</strong> of residual networks. We now
  believe that <strong>multiplicity</strong>, the network’s expressability in the
  terms of the number of paths, plays <strong>a key role</strong>.</p>

<p>But it is only a recent theory that can be confirmed or refuted. It happens sometimes that some theories are refuted and articles are withdrawn.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My question:</strong><br>
Should we think of deep ResNets as ensemble after all? <strong>Ensemble</strong> or <strong>depth</strong> makes residual networks so strong? Is it possible that even the developers themselves do not quite perceive what their own model represent and what is the key concept in it?</p>

<p>This theory is called <a href=<dic>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-prediction_framework<dic>>Memory-Prediction framework</a> and it has some striking features, for example not only bottom-up (feedforward), but also top-down information processing and the ability to make simultaneous, but discrete predictions of different future scenarios (as described <a href=<dic>http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2016.00023/full<dic>>in this paper</a>).</p>

<p>The promise of the Memory-Prediction framework is unsupervised generation of stable high level representations of future possibilities. Something which would revolutionise probably a whole bunch of AI research areas.</p>

Instead of extracting the understanding, you'll extract the instances which the your artificial cortex doesn't understand. </p>

<p>As far as I can tell, neural networks have a <strong>fixed number of neurons</strong> in the input layer.</p>

<p>If neural networks are used in a context like for example NLP, sentences or blocks of text of varying sizes are fed to a network. How is the <strong>varying input size</strong> reconciled with the <strong>fixed size</strong> of the input layer of the network? In other words: how is such a network made flexible enough to deal with an input that might be anywhere from one word to multiple pages of text?</p>

<p>If my assumption of a fixed number of input neurons is wrong and new input neurons are added to/removed from the network to match the input size I don't see how these can ever be trained.</p>

<p>I give the example of NLP, but lots of problems have an inherently unpredictable input size, I'm interested in the general approach for dealing with this.</p>

<p>edit: For images, it's clear you can up/downsample to a fixed size, but for text this seems to be an impossible approach since adding/removing text changes the meaning of the original input.</p>

<p>I understand that neural networks model biological neurons.  Each node in the network represents a neuron cell and the connections between nodes represent the connections between cells.  As in nature, a neuron fires an electrical signal to connected neurons based on some kind of threshold or function that mimics such.  </p>

<p>Recent discoveries on how the brain works reveal the importance of calcium within the cells.  See <a href=<dic>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01794675<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01794675</a> for more information.  To summarize, calcium affects the regulation, stimulation and transmission of electrical activity as well as the destruction of neurones.</p>

<p>From my study of neural networks, there does not seem to be a calcium equivalent.  Having one would imply that the functions, connections and weights in an artificial network are configured during the training and execution process and can change over time.   I understand that back-propagation is used to train the weights, but have not seen anything that trains the function nor the connections (although a zero weight could imply no connection).</p>

<p>Does anyone know of such a network (or training algorithm)?  If so, do these networks perform better than a network that is pre-configured?</p>

<p>I am a student working on my final graduation project. I was assigned to study Hyper-heuristics and it is a new subject for me. I was asked to choose a computational problem to apply Hyper-heuristics on them and see the results. However, I am afraid to choose the wrong problem. What are, in your opinion, computational problem that can be resolved with hyper-heuristics efficiently.</p>

<p>I'm a freshman to machine learning. We all know that there are 2 kinds of problems in our life: problems that humans can solve and problems we can't solve. For problems humans can solve, we always try our best to write some algorithm and tell machine to follow it step by step, and finally the machine acts like people.</p>

<p>What I'm curious about are these problems humans can't solve. If humans ourselves can't sum up and get an algorithm (which means that we ourselves don't know how to solve the problem), can a machine solve the problem? That is, can the machine sum up and get an algorithm by itself based on a large amount of problem data?</p>

<p>This is a question about a nomenclature - we already have the algorithm/solution, but we're not sure whether it qualifies as utilizing heuristics or not.</p>

<hr>

<p>feel free to skip the problem explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A friend is writing a path-finding algorithm - an autopilot for an
  (off-road) vehicle in a computer game. This is a pretty classic
  problem - he finds a viable, not necessarily optimal but <dic>good enough<dic>
  route using the A* algorithm, by taking the terrain layout and vehicle
  capabilities into account, and modifying a direct (straight) line path
  to account for these. The whole map is known a'priori and invariant,
  though the start and destination are arbitrary (user-chosen) and the
  path is not guaranteed to exist at all.</p>
  
  <p>This cookie-cutter approach comes with a twist: limited storage space.
  We can afford some more volatile memory on start, but we should free
  most of it once the route has been found. The travel may take days -
  of real time too, so the path must be saved to disk, and the space in
  the save file for custom data like this is severely limited. Too
  limited to save all the waypoints - even after culling trivial
  solution waypoints ('continue straight ahead'), and by a rather large
  margin, order of 20% the size of our data set.</p>
  
  <p>A solution we came up with is to calculate the route once on start,
  then 'forget' all the trivial and 90% of the non-trivial waypoints.
  This both serves as a proof that a solution exists, and provides a set
  of points reaching which, in sequence, guarantees the route will take
  us to the destination.</p>
  
  <p>Once the vehicle reaches a waypoint, the route to the next one is
  calculated again, from scratch. It's known to exist and be correct
  (because we did it once, and it was correct), it doesn't put too much
  strain on the CPU and the memory (it's only about 10% the total route
  length) and it doesn't need to go into permanent storage (restarting
  from any point along the path is just a subset of the solution
  connecting two saved waypoints).</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Now for the actual question:</p>

<p>The pathfinding algorithm follows a sparse set of waypoints which by themselves are not nearly sufficient as a route, but allow for easy, efficient  calculation of the actual route, simultaneously guarantying its existence; they are a subset of the full solution. </p>

<p>Is this a heuristic approach?</p>

<p>(as I understand, normally, heuristics don't guarantee existence of a solution, and merely suggest more likely candidates. In this case, the 'hints' are taken straight out of an actual working solution, thus my doubts.)</p>

<p>I understand how a neural network can be trained to recognise certain features in an image (faces, cars, ...), where the inputs are the image's pixels, and the output is a set of boolean values indicating which objects were recognised in the image and which weren't.</p>

<p>What I don't really get is, when using this approach to detect features and we detect a face for example, how we can go back to the original image and determine the location or boundaries of the detected face. How is this achieved? Can this be achieved based on the recognition algorithm, or is a separate algorithm used to locate the face? That seems unlikely since to find the face again, it needs to be recognised in the image, which was the reason of using a NN in the first place.</p>

As a training set I would like to have parts of a handwritten text (saved as a list of paths (like in vector graphics).
Maybe as a means to simplify things, I could flatten the paths in to consecutive straight lines. My program receives a string of text and produces a list of paths (or a vector graphic, whatever is easier to work with)</p>

<p>I'm wondering how feasible it is to create a machine that can separate clothing from a basket.</p>

<p>At the most basic level it would distinguish between tops, pants, button downs and socks</p>

<p>Programmatically, I'd image this would require training a neural network to recognize these items, but in real time it becomes exponentially difficult to do this in a small space at a fast rate:</p>

<ol>
<li>pick up an item</li>
<li>lay it in such a way that is recognizable </li>
<li>deduce whether it is a top, button down, etc.</li>
<li>sort it accordingly</li>
</ol>

<p>If this sounds ridiculous please let me know...</p>

<p>If it is possible :</p>

<p>would this be based on some sort of computer vision?
or only a well trained neural network?</p>

<p>For years I have been dealing with (and teaching) Knowledge Representation and Knowledge Representation languages. I just discovered that in another community (Information Systems and the such) there is something called the <dic>DIKW pyramid<dic> where they add another step after knowledge, namely wisdom.
They define data as being simply symbols, information as being the answer to who/what/when/where?, knowledge as being the answer to how?, and wisdom as being the answer to why?. </p>

<p>My question is: has anyone done the connection between what AI calls data/information/knowledge and these notions from Information Systems? In particular, how would <dic>wisdom<dic> be defined in AI? And since we have KR languages, how would we represent <dic>wisdom<dic> as they define it?</p>

<p><a href=<dic>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow<dic>>According to Wikipedia</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The AI effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence.</p>
  
  <p>Pamela McCorduck writes: <dic>It's part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something—play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems—there was chorus of critics to say, 'that's not thinking'.<dic>[1] AI researcher Rodney Brooks complains <dic>Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation.'<dic>[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wikipedia page then proposes several different reasons that could explain why onlookers might <dic>discount<dic> AI programs. However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in <dic>discounting<dic> the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in <dic>discounting<dic> the behavior of AI programs.</p>

<p>Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually <em>is</em>. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.</p>

<p>However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.</p>

<p>After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.</p>

<p>After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.</p>

<p>After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...</p>

<p>Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence. So the AI Effect occurs because humans don't know how to define <dic>intelligence<dic>, not due to people dismissing programs as not being <dic>intelligent<dic>.</p>

<p>Is this argument valid or correct? And if not, why not?</p>

<p>Here is one of the most serious questions, about the artificial intelligence.<br>
How will the machine know the difference between right and wrong, what is good and bad, what is respect, dignity, faith and empathy.<br>

<br>It will follow the ethics of its creator, the man who originally designed it<br>
 But how to teach a computer something we don't have the right answer.<br>
 People are selfish, jealous, self confident. We are not able to understand each other sorrows, pains beliefs. We don't understand different religions, different traditions or beliefs.

<p>So I'm here to propose a strategy or to ask if this strategy has been tested in genetic algorithms in the past. I didn't exactly know how to find discussion about it.</p>

<p>In a classic example of genetic algorithm you would have a population and certain amount of simulation time to evaluate it and breeding. Then proceed to the next generation.</p>

<p>What if we would isolate a small part of the population in the simulation process and keep them evolving in their own little island for some time while rest of the population continues to evolve normally?

<p>I'm interested mostly in the application of AI in gaming; in case this adjusts the way you answer, but general answers are more than welcome as well.</p>

<p>I was reading up on Neural Networks and combining them with Genetic Algorithms; my high-level understanding is that the Neural Networks are used to produce a result from the inputs, and the Genetic Algorithm is employed to constantly adjust the weights in the Neural Network until a good answer is found.</p>

<p>The concept of a Genetic Algorithm randomly mutating the weights on the inputs to a Neural Network makes sense to me; but I don't understand where this would be applied in respect to gaming.</p>

<p>The idea is to teach the neural network to create and recall useful explicit memories for a certain task. This complements the abilities of a neural network well, because NNs only store knowledge implicitly in the weights and the information used to work on a single task is only stored in the activation of the network and degrades quickly the more information you add. (<a href=<dic>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory<dic>>LSTMs</a> are one try to slow down this degradation of short term memories, but it still happens.)</p>

<p>Now, instead of keeping the necessary information in the activation, they presumably keep the addresses of memory slots for specific information in the activation, so these should also be subject to degradation. My question is why this approach should scale. Shouldn't a somewhat higher number of task specific information once again overwhelm the networks capability of keeping the addresses of all the appropriate memory slots in its activation?</p>

<p>If neurons and synapses can be implemented using transistors, what prevents us from creating arbitrarily large neural networks using the same methods with which GPUs are made?</p>

<p>In essence, we have seen how extraordinarily well virtual neural networks implemented on sequential processors work (even GPUs are sequential machines, but with huge amounts of cores). </p>

<p>One can imagine that using GPU design principles - which is basically to have thousands of programmable processing units that work in parallel - we could make much simpler <dic>neuron processing units<dic> and put millions or billions of those NPUs in a single big chip. They would have their own memory (for storing weights) and be connected to a few hundred other neurons by sharing a bus. They could have a frequency of for example 20 Hz, which would allow them to share a data bus with many other neurons.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are some electrical engineering challenges here, but it seems to me that all big tech companies should be exploring this route by now.</p>

<p>Many AI researchers say that super intelligence is coming around the year 2045. I believe that their reasoning is based on moores law and the number of neurons we are able to implement in software running on the fastest computers we have.</p>

<p>But the fact is, we today are making silicon chips with billions of transistors on them. SPARK M7 has 10 billion transistors.</p>

<p>If implementing a (non-programmable) neuron and a few hundred synapses for it requires for example 100 000 transistors, then we can make a neural network in hardware that emulates 100 000 neurons.</p>

<p>If we design such a chip so that we can simply make it physically bigger if we want more neurons, then it seems to me that arbitrarily large neural networks is simply a budget question.</p>

<p>Are we technically able to make, in hardware, arbitrarily large neural networks with current technology?</p>

<p>Remember: I am NOT asking if such a network will in fact be very intelligent. I am merely asking if we can factually make arbitrarily large, highly interconnected neural networks, if we decide to pay Intel to do this? </p>

<p>The implication is that on the day some scientist is able to create general intelligence in software, we can use our hardware capabilities to grow this general intelligence to human levels and beyond.</p>

<p>I am reading about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and I have some doubts regarding it. So far, I understand that in a GAN there are two different types of neural network: one is generative (G) and the other discriminative (D). The generative neural network generates some data which the discriminative neural network judges for correctness. The GAN learns by passing the loss function to both networks.</p>

<p>How do the discriminative (D) neural nets initially know whether the data produced by G is correct or not? Do we have to train the D first then add it into the GAN with G?</p>

<p>Let's consider my trained D net, which can classify a picture with 90% percentage accuracy. If we add this D net to a GAN there is a 10% probability it will classify a image wrong. If we train a GAN with this D net then will it also have the same 10% error in classifying an image? If yes, then why do GANs show promising results?</p>

<p>And even another awesome article for the interested user in context of deep reinforcement learning (easy and a must read for beginners): <a href=<dic>http://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow noreferrer<dic>>Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>I was thrilled by these results and immediately wanted to try them in some simple <dic>board/card game scenarios<dic>, i.e. writing AI for some simple games in order to learn more about <dic>deep learning<dic>. Of course, thinking that I can apply the techniques above easily in my scenarios was stupid. All examples above are based on convolutional nets (image recognition) and some other assumptions, which might not be applicable in my scenarios.</p>

<p>Can you give me hints or futher articles, which deal with my questions below? As a beginner, I do not have an overview, yet. Preferably, your suggestions should also be connected to the following areas already: deep learning, reinforcement learning (, multiagent systems)</p>

<hr>

<p>(1)</p>

<p>If you have a card game and the AI shall play a card from its hand, you could think about the cards (amongst other stuff) as the current game state. You can easily define some sort of neural net and feed it with the card data. In a trivial case the cards are just numbered. I do not know the net type, which would be suitable, but I guess deep reinforcment learning strategies could be applied easily then.</p>

<p>However, I can only imagine this, if there is a constant number of hand cards. In the examples above, the number of pixels is also constant, for example. What if a player can have a different numbers of cards? What to do, if a player can have an infinite number of cards? Of course, this is just a theoretical question as no game has an infinite number of cards.</p>

<hr>

<p>(2)</p>

<p>In the initial examples, the action space is constant. What can you do, if the action space is not? This more or less follows from my previous problem. If you have 3 cards, you can play card 1, 2 or 3. If you have 5 cards, you can play card 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, etc. It is also common in card games, that it is not allowed to play a card. Could this be tackled with negative reward?</p>

<hr>

<p>So, which <dic>tricks<dic> can be used, e.g. always assume a constant number of cards with <dic>filling values<dic>, which is only applicable in the non-infinite case (anyways unrealistic and even humans could not play well with that)?
Are there articles, which examine such things already?</p>

<p>The “Discounted sum of future rewards” using
discount factor γ” is</p>

<pre><code>γ (reward in 1 time step) +
γ ^ 2 (reward in 2 time steps) +
γ ^ 3 (reward in 3 time steps) + ...
</code></pre>

<p>I am confused as what constitutes a time-step. Say I take a action now, so I will get a reward in 1 time-step. Then, I will take an action again in timestep 2 to get a second reward in time-step 3
But the equation says something else. How does one define a time-step? Can we take action as well receive a reward in a single step? Examples are most helpful.</p>

<p>There is this claim around that the brain's cognitive capabilities are tightly linked to the way it processes sensorimotor information and that, in this or a similar sense, our intelligence is <dic>embodied<dic>. Lets assume, for the sake of argument, that this claim is correct (you may think the claim is too vague to even qualify for being correct, that it's <dic>not even false<dic>. If so, I would love to hear your ways of fleshing out the claim in such a way that it's specific enough to be true or false). Then, since arguably at least chronologically in our evolution, most of our higher level cognitive capabilities come after our brain's way of processing sensorimotor information, this brings up the question what it is about the way that our brains function that make them particularly suitable for the processing of sensorimotor information? What makes our brains'  architecture particularly suitable for being an information processing unit inside a body? This is my first question. And what I'm hoping for are answers that go beyond the <em>a fortiori</em> reply <dic>Our brain is so powerful and dynamic, it's great for <em>any</em> task, and so also for processing sensorimotor information<dic></p>

<p>My second question is basically the same but instead of the human brain I want to ask for neural networks. What are the properties of neural networks that makes them <em>particularly</em> suitable for processing the kind of information that is produced by a body? Here are some of the reasons why people think neural networks are powerful:</p>

<ul>
<li>The universal approximation theorem (of FFNNs)</li>
<li>their ability to learn and self-organise</li>
<li>Robustness to local degrading of information</li>
<li>their ability to abstract/coarse-grain/convolute features, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I see how these are real advantages when it comes to evolution picking its favorite model for an embodied AI, none of them (or their combination) seems to be unique to neural networks. So they don't provide a satisfactory answer to my question. What makes a neural network a more suitable structure for embodied AI than, say, having a literal Turing machine sitting inside our head, or any other structure that is capable of universal computation? For instance, I really don't see how neural networks would be a particularly natural choice for dealing with geometric information. But geometric information is pretty vital when it comes to sensorimotor information, no?</p>

<ul>
<li>force</li>
<li>angle of striker</li>
<li>position of strike </li>
</ul>

<p>Since the state and action space both are continuous, I thought of discretizing the output such that I have 270 [ valid angles from -45 to 225 degrees ] outputs for the angle, 10 outputs for force [ranging from 0 to 1] and 20 outputs for the position [ranging from 0 to 1].</p>

<p>Thus I will have 300 output of my neural network, but this number seems a bit too high compared to normal neural networks in practice. </p>

<p>Based on fitting to historical data and extrapolation, when is it expected that the number of neurons in AI systems will equal those of the human brain?</p>

<p>I'm interested in a possible direct replication of the human brain, which will need equal numbers of neurons.</p>

<p>Of course, this assumes neurons which are equally capable as their biological counterparts, which development may happen at a faster or slower rate than the quantitative increase.</p>

<p>Background:
I've been interested in, and reading about, Neural Networks for several years, but I haven't gotten around to testing them out until recently. Both for fun and to increase my understanding, I tried to write a class library from scratch in .Net.
For tests, I've tried some simple functions, such as generating output identical to the input, working with the MNIST dataset, and a few binary functions (two input OR, AND and XOR, with two outputs: one for true, one for false).
Everything seemed fine when I used a sigmoid function as the activation function but, reading of the ReLUs I decided to switch over for speed.</p>

<p>My current problem is that, when I switch to using ReLUs, I found that I was unable to train a network of any complexity (tested from as few as 2 internal nodes up to a mesh of 100x100 nodes) to correctly function as an XOR gate. I see two possibilities here:</p>

<p>1) My implementation is faulty,
(This one is frustrating, as I've re-written the code multiple times in various ways, and I still get the same result),</p>

<p>2) Aside from being faster or slower to train, there are some problems that are impossible to solve given a specific activation function,
(Fascinating idea, but I've no idea if it's true or not)</p>

<p>My inclination is to think that 1) above is correct. However, given the amount of time I've invested, it would be nice if I could rule out 2) definitively before I spend even more time going over my implementation.</p>

<p>Edit for specifics:
For the XOR network, I have tried both using two inputs (0 for false, 1 for true), and using four inputs (each pair, one signals true and one false, per <dic>bit<dic> of input).
I have also tried using 1 output (with a 1 (realy, >0.9) corresponding to true and a 0 (or &lt;0.1) corresponding to false), as well as two outputs (one signaling true and the other false).</p>

<p>Each training epoch, I run against four sets of input: 00->0, 01->1, 10->1, 11->0.</p>

<p>I find that the first three converge towards correct answer, but the final input (11) converges towards 1, even though I train it with an expected value of 0.</p>

<p>After the explosion of fake news during the US election, and following the question about whether AIs can educate themselves via the internet, it is clear to me that any newly-launched AI will have a serious problem knowing what to believe (ie rely on as input for making predictions and decisions).</p>

<p>Let's say I have a string <dic>America<dic> and I want to convert it into a number to feed into a machine learning algorithm.

<p>I'm trying to understand Boltzmann machines. Tutorials explain it with two formulas.</p>

<p>Logistic function for the probability of single units:</p>

<pre><code> $p(unit=1)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\sum_{x}wx } }$
</code></pre>

<p>and, when the machine is running, every state of the machine goes to the probability:</p>

<pre><code>$ p(State= state\ with\ energy\ E_i )=\frac{e^{-E_i}}{\sum_i e^{-E_i}} $
</code></pre>

<p>so, the state depends on the units, and then if I understand correctly, the second formula is a consequence of the first; so, how can it be the proof that the distribution of $p(state)$ is a consequence of $p(unit)$?</p>

<p>I installed a local running instance of the <a href=<dic>http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow noreferrer<dic>>ConceptNet5</a> knowledgebase in an elasticsearch server. I used this data to implement the so-called <dic><a href=<dic>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogietechnik<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow noreferrer<dic>>Analogietechnik</a><dic> (a creativity technique to solve a problem from the perspective of another system) as an algorithm.</p>

<p>The technique works as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose a Feature of a System</li>
<li>Find Systems who have this feature also</li>
<li>Solve the problem from the perspective of these other systems</li>
<li>Apply the found solutions to the issue</li>
</ol>

<p>As an example is here the problem of marketing a shopping mall: A Shopping mall has many rooms and floors (1). A museum has also many rooms and floors (2). How are museums marketed? They present many pictures or sculptures (3). We could use our rooms and floors to decorate them with pictures and sculptures (4).</p>

<p>Of course the idea to implement that as an artifically intelligent algorithm was not far. However, I feel a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of methods that exist out there. Neural Networks, Bayesian Interference and so on... My current experience doesn't go further than simple machine learning like kMeans-Clustering for example. Do you think it would be very hard to find a solution for this problem? </p>

<p>I'm thinking of a console application, where you can enter a conceptualized problem like <dic>methods for creative writing<dic>, for example, and it uses the above method to find possible solutions of the issue. Of course no solution with extensive depth, more something like basic ideas derived from the knowledge database I have.</p>

<p>Lets take as an example a console application where someone asks <dic>how to write a novel<dic>:</p>

<ol>
<li>It should find out first that the system all is about is in the term <dic>novel<dic>. To find a feature of that system it just searches concepts containing that term: it finds out <dic>Novel is a story<dic> So thats a feature.</li>
<li>Which systems are also stories? A good concept it should find is e.g. <dic>Plot is a story<dic>. (Of course only when I am selecting the search results manually)--> <strong>How to find best concepts of a list when not knowing which fits best?</strong></li>
<li>It should then find out that a plot is written using a storyline: <dic>storyline is a plot<dic></li>
<li>One possible answer of the AI would in this case be: <dic>By writing a storyline<dic></li>
</ol>

<p>Do you know some helpful libraries, algorithms or other resources that might help me? I know this is not an easy thing to program, but you might agree that its highly interesting.</p>

<p>I am new to machine learning and I know how to implement simple neural networks using logistic regression as a cost function. But I want to know whether neural nets are used in reinforcement learning in general(and not just in special cases) ? If yes, then what cost function they use. As I already know neural nets with logistic regression are used in supervised learning and reinforcement learning is a part of unsupervised learning. There are many threads which are related to RL and neural nets but all of them are about a particular case or an algorithm and I want to know about RL in general.</p>

<p>I am researching <strong>Cellular Neural Network (CNN)</strong> and have already read <strong>Chua</strong>'s two article (<strong>1988</strong>).

In CNN, image processing is performed with only <strong>19 numbers</strong> (two 3x3 matrix called A and B and one bias value). </p>

<p>I wonder how can we call CNN as a <strong><em>neural network</em></strong>. Because there is no learning algorithm in CNN neither <strong>supervised</strong> nor <strong>unsupervised</strong>. </p>

<p>I am new to deep learning. </p>

<p>I have a dataset of images of varying dimensions of a certain object. A few images of the object are also in varying orientations. The objective is to learn the features of the object (using Autoencoders). </p>

<p>Is it possible to create a network with layers that account for varying dimensions and orientations of the input image, or should I strictly consider a dataset containing images of uniform dimensions? What is the necessary criteria of an eligible dataset to be used for training a Deep Network in general.</p>

<p>A single neuron is capable of forming a decision boundary between linearly seperable data. Is there any intuition as to how many, and in what configuration, would be necessary to correctly approximate a sinusoidal decision boundary?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I am using policy gradients in my reinforcement learning algorithm, and occasionally my environment provides a severe penalty when a wrong move is made. I'm using a neural network with stochastic gradient decent to learn the policy. To do this, my loss is essentially the cross-entropy loss of the action distribution multiplied by the discounted rewards, where most often the rewards are positive. </p>

<p>But how do I handle negative rewards? Since the loss will occasionally go negative, it will think these actions are very good, and will strengthen the weights in the direction of the penalties. Is this correct, and if so, what can I do about it?</p>

<p>Edit:
In thinking about this a little more, SGD doesn't necessarily directly weaken weights, it only strengthens weights in the direction of the gradient and as a side-effect, weights get diminished for other states outside the gradient, correct? So I can simply set reward=0 when the reward is negative, and those states will be ignored in the gradient update. It still seems unproductive to not account for states that are really bad, and it'd be nice to include them somehow. Unless I'm misunderstanding something fundamental here.</p>

<p>Cognitive Psychology is one of the basic sciences of artificial intelligence (AI). The founder of the psychology is <strong>Wilhelm W.(1832-1920)</strong>, who engaged in empirical methods,and was interested in the <strong><em>thinking processes</em></strong> during his scientific work.</p>

<p>According to his research,Psychology had two main leading subjects: </p>

<ol>
<li>Behaviourism.</li>
<li>Cognitivism.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Behaviourism:</strong> Refused the theory of the mental processes, and insisted to study the resulted action or the stimulus strictly objective. The representatives of this theory have been decreasing with time.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive psychology:</strong> defines that the brain is an information processing device.</p>

<p><strong>Human Computing Interaction:</strong>
We may come in a contact with Humana Computer Interaction every day, because this field includes the every day use of computer for example;tapping stack exchange app on smart-phone, the user interfaces and some other expert programs which may use cognitive psychology in order to manipulate or help people. But still such tasks have got a minimal  relevant connection.</p>

  <p>Exercise 1   Genetic algorithm to solve pattern finding problem. </p>
  
  <p>Your task is to design a simple genetic algorithm, with binary-coded chromosomes, in order  to solve pattern finding problem
  in 16-bit strings.  </p>
  
  <p>The objective function is given by the following
  formula:    </p>
  
  <p>F(x) = NoS(<dic>010<dic>) + 2NoS(<dic>0110<dic>) + 3NoS(<dic>01110<dic>) +

  <p>The algorithm should display each population on the screen in the form     And
  should save the history of it’s operation (average fitness in each
  population) in the text  file. At the end it should also display the
  best solution found.    </p>
  
  <p>You may use the following operators:  </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Reproduction.<br>
  You can use either one of the following reproduction
  types:  Proportional, Ranking, Tournament. They are described more in
  detail below:
  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...</p></li>
  <li><p>Crossing over.<br>
  In order to perform this operation the individuals must be grouped in
  pairs (randomly), and  with certain probability pcross information
  from their chromosomes must be exchanged. There  are many flavors of
  the crossing-over operator, but in our case (short, 16-bit
  chromosome),  simple, one-point crossover will be enough. It can be
  performed by selecting a random  number k from the range &lt;1;15> and
  cutting the chromosomes of both individuals on that  position. Each of
  the individuals copies bits  belonging to the other to it’s own 
  chromosome.  </p></li>
  <li><p>Mutation<br>
  This operator changes the value of each bit in the chromosome to the opposite one with a very  small probability pm
  (usually about 10-3).  If we denote chromosome as [b1, b2, ... , b16];
  then after the mutation each bit can be  described as:  Where k Î
  {1,2, ...,16}  flip(x) – result of a Bernoulli flip with a success 
  probability x.</p></li>

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p>

<p>In my main body of text there are some substrings that I want to extract.  Note that I don't want to construct or generate new strings, the characters I extract must be part of the main text. Normally I would use a regex to extract this substring when the text and substring are relatively simple. </p>

<p>For example, from the text:</p>

<pre><code>... some text ...
Today, Fake Acme Corp. changed its name to Really Not Fake Acme Corp.
... some more text ...
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to extract the names <code>Fake Acme Corp.</code> and <code>Really Not Fake Acme Corp.</code></p>

<p>Points to keep in mind (aka why regex won't work):</p>

<ul>
<li>The format of the sentence is not fixed, neither is its location in
the document. The 2 names could be in different sentences.</li>
<li>There is no guarantee that the new company name will be related to the old name.</li>
<li>There is no guarantee that only 2 company names will be mentioned in the document (so standard CRF approaches that detect the <code>ORG</code> class  viz. <code>CoreNLP</code>/<code>OpenNLP</code> won't be of much help).</li>
</ul>

Using a character encoding format as per <a href=<dic>https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow noreferrer<dic> title=<dic>this paper &#40;Character-level CNNs&#41;<dic>>this paper on character-level cnns</a> I constructed an LSTM network using <a href=<dic>https://keras.io/<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow noreferrer<dic>>Keras</a> which took as input each character encoded in a one-hot format. The output was also a one-hot vector.</p>

<p>Eg: The input text is <code>1024</code> characters, encoded in a one-hot vector with an alphabet of <code>73</code> (see paper linked above for more on this). The output is a one-hot encoded vector that is the substring I want.</p>

<p>Input shape: <code>1024 x 73</code>, Output shape: <code>1024 x 73</code> (in the output only the characters that match the substring are one-hot, the rest of the rows are all <code>0</code>)</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Use LSTMs when regex will become too powerful/complicated/unable to work.</p>

<p>If I have a dataset of images, and I extract all cnn feature vectors from them.
After that I generate the pca model of these features by doing:</p>

<pre><code>pca.fit(ALL_features)
</code></pre>

<p>IF I have a new image and I need to check the similarity between this image and the whole dataset, what I have to do?</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract cnn features from this image.</li>
<li>How to use the previous pca model?</li>
<li>How to check the similarity between the dataset features and the new image features?</li>
</ol>

<p>Is by doing this? or how?</p>

<pre><code>self.pca.transform(self.db_feats)
</code></pre>

<p>I am working on a project, wherein I take input from the user as free text and try to relate the text to what the user might mean. I have tried <strong>Stanford NLP</strong> which tokenizes the text into tokens, but I am not able to categorize the input. For example, the user might be greeting someone or sharing some problem he is facing. In case he is sharing some problem I need to categorize the problem as well.</p>

<p>Can someone help me with from where should I start?</p>

<p>Is it possible to train an agent to take and pass a multiple-choice exam based on a digital version of a textbook for some area of study or curriculum? What would be involved in implementing this and how long would it take, for someone familiar with deep learning?</p>

<p>I had already started in my graduation project process , It's about an application which will learn users new language by playing games , and it's based on AI , the concept is the user will start his level and play games and do quizzes , at the end of each level there will be a test to pass the level , I have to implement AI in this app to analysis its test grades and know what is the user weakness and power point to create a new level which suits the user's language level , that means if he is good in grammar but weak in vocabulary so the new level will create to strength the vocabulary , games and questions will be categorized into the database for this purpose , so the AI algorithms should analyse and decide which game or quiz should the user takes based on his level , then it will create the level .
I had searched before and reached for some techniques like (machine learning , planning systems , reinforcement learning and case-based-reasoning ).</p>

<p>One of the most crucial questions we as a species and as intelligent beings will have to address lies with the rights we plan to grant to AI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question is intended to see if a compromise can be found between <strong>conservative anthropocentrism</strong> and <strong>post-human fundamentalism</strong>: a response should take into account principles from both perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should AI be granted the same rights as humans or should such systems have different rights (if any at all) ?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Some Background</em></strong></p>

<p>This question applies both to human-brain based AI (from whole brain emulations to less exact replication) and AI from scratch.</p>

<p>Murray Shanahan, in his book The Technological Singularity, outlines a potential use of AI that could be considered immoral: <em>ruthless parallelization</em>: we could make identical parallel copies of AI to achieve tasks more effectively and even terminate less succesful copies.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should such use of AI be accepted or should certain limitations i.e. rights be created for AI?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no doubt as to the fact that AI would be replacing a lot of existing technologies, but is AI the ultimate technology which humankind can develop or is their something else which has the potential to replace artificial intelligence?</p>

<p>The cake example presented in the book <dic>artificial intelligence :a modern approach<dic> to illustrate a planning graph, doesn't show a mutex at action 'A1' between Eat(Cake) and the persistance of notHave(Cake), even though the precondition for the action Eat(Cake) and the result of the persistance of notHave(Cake) are opposite. So is there a special rule, or was it removed to just not clutter the graph? <a href=<dic>https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFAws.png<dic> rel=<dic>nofollow noreferrer<dic>><img src=<dic>https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFAws.png<dic> alt=<dic>enter image description here<dic>></a></p>

<p>Printing actionspace for Pong-v0 gives 'Discrete(6)' as output, i.e.0,1,2,3,4,5 are actions defined in environment as per documentation, but game needs only two controls. Why this discrepency? Further is that necessary to identify which number from 0 to 5 corresponds to which action in gym environment?</p>

<p>However, I would like to know if I could make it detect <dic>similar<dic> phrases instead of trying to come up with every possible phrase someone would type. How can I do this?</p>
