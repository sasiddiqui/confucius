There are &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too many to list, but here is a taste of what question are answered every day by music theory&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do I write a melody over this progression?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can I get from this passage to a completely different one?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do I make multiple melodies stand out?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;What harmony makes sense over this melody?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music theory in the simplest is the study of what works and what doesn&lt;sq&gt;t in music. So while there is a formal path for studying the subject, simple things like someone listening to a song and figuring out what they like and what they don&lt;sq&gt;t is also music theory. Typically, when one does this they are aligning with typical music theory whether it finding standard progressions or using typical chords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said since music is in the ears of the beholder and what you may find pleasing and what I may find pleasing  may be two different things, but studying music theory will give you all the tools you could ever want to understand what you like and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the intro music theory courses you&lt;sq&gt;ll typically study music theory from the classical common practice period as it is the base building block of today&lt;sq&gt;s music. In these classes you&lt;sq&gt;ll learn ways to  analyse, construct, and understand music in the context of the classical common practice period. and As you learn more and more, you&lt;sq&gt;ll start learning different ways and methods of looking a the same progressions and how to change the context that you look at them in. Some of them may clash with each other for example, if you are writing any thing that is atonal, you&lt;sq&gt;ll be at ends with the theories of the classical common practice period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who studies music theory to the point you mentioned will be trying to find new ways to analyse, construct, and understand music. Music theory is already used extensively to generate music and &lt;a href=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//tones.wolfram.com/generate/&lt;dq&gt; rel=&lt;dq&gt;nofollow&lt;dq&gt;&gt;Wolfram Alpha even has an algorithm to generate different kinds of music based on style.&lt;/a&gt;. Music theory is the basis of algorithms like this and will create more as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;What kind of questions does theory of music try to answer? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether there are formal theories of music which define axioms and rules of inference. There must be plenty possible small theories. For example, a (quite useless) theory for all diatonic pieces in any major key would prove that every note is from mode in some key or prove otherwise. A slightly more complex theory might add dominant cadences and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there formal, consistent theories that would would not reject successful music but reject almost all randomly generated notes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know there is some work in this field, take &lt;a href=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/Emily-howell.htm&lt;dq&gt;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; for example, a software that can generate music. If generated music is lacking or not interesting, I imagine that a simpler goal would be to not reject good music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">35945</str><long name="_version_">1561170600028798976</long><float name="score">10.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.8211914 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.8211914 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0 0.6931471805599453 10.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">0.5661583008561393</double></doc><doc><arr name="body"><str>{'answer': '&lt;p&gt;Your last attempt is almost good, you just need to use &lt;code&gt;$note&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;#note&lt;/code&gt;.  What&lt;sq&gt;s the difference?  &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; introduces a Scheme expression &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; as a music expression bypassing any change or interpretation.  Which in this case means that you have the &lt;em&gt;identical&lt;/em&gt; (not just the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt;) expression 7 times in a row, and if you transpose the expression, this identical expression in it will get transposed 7 times as well.  So you want a copy each time, and &lt;code&gt;$note&lt;/code&gt; will achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another note, you want to add a rhythm here.  That means that &lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt; cannot be a music expression (which already would have a duration) but only a pitch.  So you should replace the &lt;code&gt;ly&lt;colon&gt;music?&lt;/code&gt; predicate with &lt;code&gt;ly&lt;colon&gt;pitch?&lt;/code&gt; in order to have &lt;code&gt;$note&lt;/code&gt; just be a single pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the final complication is that if you use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\\relative {&lt;br&gt;   \\pattern_one c&lt;sq&gt;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;you don&lt;sq&gt;t want to have this turn into&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\\relative {&lt;br&gt;    c&lt;sq&gt;8 c&lt;sq&gt;4 c&lt;sq&gt; c&lt;sq&gt; c&lt;sq&gt; c&lt;sq&gt; c&lt;sq&gt; c&lt;sq&gt;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;since the octaves will go through the roof, because the &lt;code&gt;&lt;sq&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is applied to each consecutive note.  You want any modifiers to apply only to the first occurrence.  There is a trick macro for that purpose called &lt;code&gt;make-relative&lt;/code&gt;.  Putting all of this together, you get&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pattern_one = #(define-music-function&lt;br&gt;     (parser location note)&lt;br&gt;     (ly&lt;colon&gt;pitch?)&lt;br&gt;     (make-relative (note) note&lt;br&gt;     #{&lt;br&gt;       $note 4 $note 8 $note 8 $note 8 $note 8 $note 8 $note 8&lt;br&gt;     #}))&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if you are taking a somewhat recent development version of LilyPond, rhythms can stand on their own so you only actually need a single &lt;code&gt;$note&lt;/code&gt; and can save yourself the &lt;code&gt;make-relative&lt;/code&gt; trouble.  Also argument lists are simpler, so you can write&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pattern_one = #(define-music-function (note) (ly&lt;colon&gt;pitch?)&lt;br&gt;     #{&lt;br&gt;       $note 4 8 8 8 8 8 8&lt;br&gt;     #})&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the legibility and conciseness of that expression, the question is whether the music function is even worth writing in the first place.  For more complex rhythms, possibly also involving articulations, it might.  For this amount of complexity, it seems a bit of overkill.  Also the function will require a lot more work to deal with chords while the written-out version will just work fine with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;I&lt;sq&gt;m working on a song with a repetitive rhythm that changes pitch. As this would normally involve a large amount of repeated typing, I would like to define a Lily pond function to do this for me. I&lt;sq&gt;m completely lost on how to change the note duration (I figured out the argument for a pitch, but have yet to figure out how to add the duration in the function body, considering that &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; seems to register as invalid syntax, and plain numbers are interpreted as part of the variable name), and I can only get it to return one note at a time. Repeating the note variable in the function body as shown below does nothing (this is expected, as Scheme seems to implicitly return only the last value in the function)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to get a function like this to work? Alternativly, is there a way to multiply notes in the same way as measure-long rests are multiplied (&lt;code&gt;R1*n&lt;/code&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;My attempts&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to return multiple values (tried without commas first)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pattern_one = #(define-music-function&lt;br&gt;         (parser location note)&lt;br&gt;         (ly&lt;colon&gt;music?)&lt;br&gt;           note, note, note, note, note, note)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to return list&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pattern_one = #(define-music-function&lt;br&gt;         (parser location note)&lt;br&gt;         (ly&lt;colon&gt;music?)&lt;br&gt;           (note, note, note, note, note, note))&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Lilypond syntax (this worked, but transposed the entire group of notes up one octave per call to &lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt;, and still leaves the problem of duration)&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pattern_one = #(define-music-function&lt;br&gt;         (parser location note)&lt;br&gt;         (ly&lt;colon&gt;music?)&lt;br&gt;         #{&lt;br&gt;           #note #note #note #note #note #note #note&lt;br&gt;         #})&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I want to happen&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Input = d, output = d8 d8 d8 d8 d8 d8 or (preferably) d4 d8 d8 d8 d8 d8 d8&lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">50191</str><long name="_version_">1561170662066749440</long><float name="score">9.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.8866267 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.8866267 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1 0.4054651081081644 9.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">0.5252978324227999</double></doc><doc><arr name="body"><str>{'answer': '&lt;p&gt;It is not necessary to double the root when converting guitar chords to piano chords but it could be done if fits better with the music.  But there are &lt;strong&gt;important distinctions between the guitar and piano that come into play when considering how to notate chords on sheet music.&lt;/strong&gt;  These distinctions center around (and are affected by) the way chords are played on the two instruments.  Allow me to explain further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A basic major or minor chord consists of three notes.  On piano these three notes are often played in root position and depending on if they are played with left hand or right hand, they could be noted on the bass or treble staff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it is not uncommon for a composer to choose to notate an inversion of any given chord (&lt;strong&gt;or add a parallel octave&lt;/strong&gt;) on piano music - depending on the musical effect and what is going on between left and right hand and how the harmony is working in conjunction with the melody. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guitar is laid out entirely differently than a piano and therefore the practicality of playing various chord voicings is a limiting factor in terms of what can physically be played on guitar.  Instead of 88 keys a guitar has 6 strings.  And instead of each string (or set of strings) being a different length (as on piano) - on guitar each string is the same length.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On guitar it is easier to play a chord by strumming all six strings&lt;/strong&gt; rather than attempting to isolate three string while missing the other three - especially since each string is less than 1/4 inch apart.  &lt;strong&gt;So it is very common on guitar to include a parallel octave&lt;/strong&gt; or sometimes three octaves.  And this happenstance has more to do with &lt;strong&gt;the logistics of playing the instrument&lt;/strong&gt; than anything else.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the logistics of instrument design and tuning, guitar chords are usually voiced an octave lower than what is shown on the musical staff. If you play basic guitar chords in their most common open or 1st position (using some open strings and played near the headstock where the fret spacing is more generous), the pitch class of the notes would correspond to one octave lower than what is written in standard notation for piano.  The reason for this is that if you tried to note the corresponding pitches in the corresponding octave for the way a basic open guitar chord is played the same way you would notate those same notes on piano, many of the notes would end up between the Bass and Treble staff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example a common way to play a G major chord on guitar is&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//i.stack.imgur.com/UoRM2.jpg&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;img src=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//i.stack.imgur.com/UoRM2.jpg&lt;dq&gt; alt=&lt;dq&gt;G Chord Chart&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To play this chord you would strum all six strings and the notes played would be G B D G B G, low to high starting from the G an octave and a half below middle C.  Note that in this chord &lt;strong&gt;the root (G) is played 3 times in 3 different octaves.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written on standard music notation it would look like this&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//i.stack.imgur.com/9bAhM.jpg&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;img src=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//i.stack.imgur.com/9bAhM.jpg&lt;dq&gt; alt=&lt;dq&gt;G guitar on music staff&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be highly unorthodox to write a chord this way to be played on piano.  In most sheet music for guitar the chords are noted with 6 line tablature, or just the chord name or the chord chart above the music staves.  Or sometimes the guitar chord may be abbreviated on the treble staff but the guitarist would normally play the basic open chord which would sound an octave lower than what was written. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons - it is not common to attempt a literal direct translation between the exact pitch class notes played on guitar to piano.  The best approach is to &lt;strong&gt;choose a voicing for piano based on what fits with the rest of what is going on musically and what best serves the harmonic purpose and what sounds best in the context.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, do what works for each respective instrument within the musical context of the piece.  What works best on guitar will usually not be what works best for piano or keyboard.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;If you take guitar chords and put them into sheet music for piano, should you double the root (CEGC) or not (CEG)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you do is it wrong because you&lt;sq&gt;d have parallel octaves? I mean I know parallel octaves are wrong to use in music theory classes, but do parallel octaves even matter when it comes to things like this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">44464</str><long name="_version_">1561170639870492673</long><float name="score">8.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.5323308 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.5323308 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2 0.2876820724517809 8.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">0.39351143886917617</double></doc><doc><arr name="body"><str>{'answer': '&lt;p&gt;Harry, I think I understand what you&lt;sq&gt;re saying and what you&lt;sq&gt;re trying to achieve when you say &lt;dq&gt;trying a bit,&lt;dq&gt; &lt;dq&gt;musical direction,&lt;dq&gt; and &lt;dq&gt;forward push,&lt;dq&gt; but I think the answer may be the opposite of what you may think it is. Musical direction and meaning doesn&lt;sq&gt;t come from individual notes, but from the relationship of one note to another, one phrase to another, and how they all fit into the story that you&lt;sq&gt;re telling. Think of a movie. Not every ounce of emotion and meaning is put into each scene, and many scenes are actually without much action or meaning on their own, but when paced properly and connected effectively with the surrounding scenes, it&lt;sq&gt;s the whole movie that tells the story. The scenes, however, must move the story forward, not by trying express so much in each scene, but by doing its part to maintain and move the thread of the story all the way through to the end of the movie. When done well, you forget that you&lt;sq&gt;re watching a movie, and you&lt;sq&gt;re just experiencing the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To translate this into your trumpet playing, your &lt;dq&gt;music direction&lt;dq&gt; (as opposed to &lt;dq&gt;context&lt;dq&gt;) reference probably shouldn&lt;sq&gt;t be applied to each note, but to the thought about how each note fits in to the phrase and piece as a whole. In other words, make sure that you mean each note and that you are clear on exactly how that note should sound in order for that phrase to express what you&lt;sq&gt;re trying to say. From a technical perspective, it could be something as simple as the ending of phrases, when you run out of breath, pinch the note off, or intonation goes haywire. In order for the next phrase to sound as if it logically follows the previous phrase, you have to end the previous phrase with that knowledge in mind. Many beginners play &lt;dq&gt;vertically&lt;dq&gt; – one note at a time, one bar at a time, or one phrase at a time –\xa0without enough thought about what happened in the previous phrase, or about what is about to happen in the next phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use a trumpet example, think of the first phrase of the Haydn concerto. Following the contours of the rising notes, it&lt;sq&gt;s obvious how that phrase should be shaped. So, as you play it, don&lt;sq&gt;t let anything get in the way of the logical build-up to that high point. I think of it as three mini-waves, each one ebbing and flowing, but each one cresting a little higher than the last, and each one building on the last. One phrase doesn&lt;sq&gt;t have much meaning without the phrases surrounding it&lt;colon&gt; Daaa daaa da, da da-da-da-da &lt;em&gt;daaa&lt;/em&gt;, da &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;da-da-da-da&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; daaa ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, what you&lt;sq&gt;re trying to achieve is more mental than physical. Once you have a clear idea of what you&lt;sq&gt;re trying to say, the mechanics of how you will say it will be clearer, and the individual notes will more naturally have the meaning and sense of direction you&lt;sq&gt;re looking for. The rest is just trumpet playing, the mechanics, not music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;(After listening to the Balsom clip that you referenced, I wonder if you&lt;sq&gt;re referring more to the sound and how each note is so vivid and alive, and how they inevitably flow to the next note. Both Balsom and the singer do this very well. If this is what you&lt;sq&gt;re talking about, then it starts by having excellent technique – perfect intonation, each note slotted dead center, and good air support. When each note is slotted like that, with a nice, relaxed core sound, it naturally gives the sense of inevitability, or &lt;dq&gt;moving forward,&lt;dq&gt; you would say it. It&lt;sq&gt;s dynamic and effortless. When it&lt;sq&gt;s out of tune, or you&lt;sq&gt;re not centered in the slot of each note, or too tight, the sound is static and pondering. The former is timeless, while the latter is &lt;dq&gt;stuck&lt;dq&gt; in time. It&lt;sq&gt;s like the difference between trying to put a jigsaw puzzle together when you don&lt;sq&gt;t know how the pieces fit, vs. when you already know the picture, and layout of the pieces is logical. Hard to put into words. Of course, I could also have this all wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;To create a sense of &lt;dq&gt;musical direction&lt;dq&gt;, I personally think what we need is to create a sense of music &lt;dq&gt;going somewhere&lt;dq&gt;, giving the music a &lt;dq&gt;forward push&lt;dq&gt;, if you like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, though, someone on this website (sorry, I forgot who! &lt;colon&gt;-() said that this means we should play every notes as if we are &lt;dq&gt;trying a bit&lt;dq&gt;. This recommendation I found to be absolutely fantastic, especially for singing in creating the sense not only of forward motion, but for colouring the note (n.b. although if we want to know &lt;dq&gt;where&lt;dq&gt; and &lt;dq&gt;when&lt;dq&gt; a note should be coloured &lt;dq&gt;how&lt;dq&gt;, we need to think harder on &lt;dq&gt;musical phrasing&lt;dq&gt; aspect of musicality, i.e. how a note is to be connected with other notes in a phrase and meta-phrase). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, for my main obsession, trumpet playing, I am slightly at a loss as to how best to translate this sense of &lt;dq&gt;trying a bit&lt;dq&gt; to my playing. If anyone at all therefore has any idea how, IN PRACTICAL TERMS (e.g. breathing (out) technique, embouchure formation/dynamics), I could accommodate this sense of &lt;dq&gt;trying a bit&lt;dq&gt; to my trumpet playing, then I would be eternally grateful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks! &lt;colon&gt;-))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">44815</str><long name="_version_">1561170641558700032</long><float name="score">7.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.5557455 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.5557455 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3 0.22314355131420976 7.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">0.39187168902041397</double></doc><doc><arr name="body"><str>{'answer': '&lt;p&gt;From the way you worded your question, it sounds like you might not be completely clear on the concept of dotted notes vs. tied notes.  A dot after a note means the rhythmic value of the note is increased by 1/2 of the value of the note.  For example, a dotted half note lasts for 3 beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tie between two notes means that they are played as one note with the value of the two notes added together.  For example, a half note tied to a quarter note lasts 3 beats, the same as a dotted half note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tied notes don&lt;sq&gt;t always have a dotted note equivalent, because they are used when a note crosses a bar line or when using it makes the notation more clearly reflect the meter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally the choice of whether to use a dotted note vs. two tied notes is based on what makes the notation easiest to follow.  It&lt;sq&gt;s hard to explain this in words, but to see it, try writing in the beats in each version of the music (i.e. write 1 - 2 -3 -4 to indicate where the beats fall in the measure.  I think you will see that it is a lot easier to do that in the 2nd version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to learn sheet music once again by re-teaching myself by reading pieces of music. Basically I&lt;sq&gt;m using a digital audio work station to place the notes into a piano roll and checking the score to see if they match up with the sheet music, I feel it is an excellent way for learning sheet music. Now the piece of music makes uses of dotted notes, 1/8th dotted especially, this is my problem, when I draw the notes into the piano roll and check the score the notes show up as being tied notes instead of dotted notes, a 1/8th dotted note is simply 3 × 1/16 notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please take a look at the picture below of the sheet music&lt;colon&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//i.stack.imgur.com/kThB8.png&lt;dq&gt; alt=&lt;dq&gt;&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, first we have an 8th note, a 16th note and a dotted eighth note, and then an eighth, afterwards we have 3 16th notes and then a dotted eighth before a final eighth. &lt;em&gt;Please correct me if I&lt;sq&gt;m wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well this is how my score is turning out to look like&lt;colon&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//i.stack.imgur.com/IvG5b.png&lt;dq&gt; alt=&lt;dq&gt;enter image description here&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are there 11 notes in my score, when there are only 9 notes? I only have 9 notes drawn out and it perfectly fits 1 bar. Also you can see that instead of showing the note as being dotted it&lt;sq&gt;s tied? I&lt;sq&gt;m really confused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">33886</str><long name="_version_">1561170594826813440</long><float name="score">6.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.5495503 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.5495503 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 4 0.18232155679395462 6.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">0.3906961327351054</double></doc><doc><arr name="body"><str>{'answer': '&lt;p&gt;It really depends on your specific personal goals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&lt;sq&gt;s only a bad habit if you have a &lt;strong&gt;compelling need to be able to sight read and play a piece note by note.&lt;/strong&gt;  If you were going to be in a position where you would be expected to instantly play any piece that was put in front of you without rehearsal, then you would want to overcome that tendency and learn to play note for note by looking at the note and playing the music as you read it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you are playing for your own personal enjoyment, or &lt;strong&gt;will only be required to perform pieces that you have plenty of advance time to prepare&lt;/strong&gt;, then there is no need for you to make an effort to re-program your ingrained method of learning to play a piece.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my case, after I painstakingly work out the piece by reading the music and listening to a recording of what it is supposed to sound like, I memorize how to play it and then don&lt;sq&gt;t even use the music. But I only play for my own entertainment and enjoyment and occasionally share with a few friends.  I personally have other things that I would prefer to devote my time and brainpower to than learning to sight read music note by note.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I can see that having the music would make it easier to remember what I was remembering.  In other words, I would not have to remember every place there was a key change or a fast ascending run or a pause or turnaround - because I could follow along with the sheet music and at least tell where those parts were. But since I play most of my music on guitar and only a few things on piano, I will probably do fine just memorizing the entire piece and maybe use the sheet music to brush up on a piece I have not played in some time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;If what you are doing works for you and what you want to accomplish with your music, then there is no need to worry about changing your methods. Your time and energy may be better spent learning more songs.

Develop your own style based upon what you already know, and incorporate any new knowledge, further developing it. 4) Yes, there are plenty of instrumental covers of rap music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long &lt;sq&gt;answers&lt;sq&gt; - I hope no one takes any offense, OP included&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;sq&gt;ll assume you aren&lt;sq&gt;t trolling and you truly have these questions...  You seem to be seeking definitive answers to questions that have no definitive answers.  Leaving textbook or dictionary definitions out of it, the concept of music is one that is defined by individual perception and interpretation.  What is music to one person may not be to another, and neither person is right nor wrong.  Your subsequent questions rely on a definitive answer to the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, casting that aside for now, the main issue is differentiating between rap, rap music, and hip hop music.  I&lt;sq&gt;ll leave hip hop as a culture out of this.  Again, this is all open to interpretation, especially considering that a lexicon is based on usage and is both regional and cultural.  So, this is all from my perspective as a non-hip hop musician in the southern US.  Rap is, as has already been pointed out, a vocal technique - or more specifically it is rhythmically improvising or reciting rhymes or verses.  Rap music, which is generally what people seem to refer to when they use the term &lt;sq&gt;rap&lt;sq&gt;, is essentially rapping to music. Hip hop music is a broader genre that generally encompasses rap music.  Making it more confusing, genres have a tendency to blur over time and the music industry loves crossover appeal in order for a song to reach wider audiences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you need to learn &lt;sq&gt;conventional music&lt;sq&gt; for learning rap music?  No, but that really depends on what you&lt;sq&gt;re trying to do and what you personally consider to be rap music.  I am a classically trained musician, but I know many songwriters, producers (amateur counts right?) and even musicians that have no formal knowledge of music theory, and I consider them better than myself in what they try to achieve.  Listening to a lot of music tends to give one an innate understanding, whether they know what musical terms different concepts are called or not.  It can definitely help though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naming resources isn&lt;sq&gt;t useful without knowing what your goal is.  If your goal is to sell your music through any of the currently generally available avenues, you&lt;sq&gt;re on a hard road of discovery and learning no matter where your talents lie.  If your goal is to make music, then pick up a pencil, tap it on the table, and make up some rhymes to the beat. &lt;colon&gt;)  If you&lt;sq&gt;re really serious about it, I&lt;sq&gt;d recommend downloading a trial of a DAW like FL Studio and playing around with it.  Try creating basic renditions of your favorite songs.  Learn how to make basic beats and/or melodies.  Download other people&lt;sq&gt;s projects and see how they fit together. Then play around with your own ideas.  I&lt;sq&gt;m sure there is a multitude of much simpler music creation software, but I am not familiar with any of them.  There&lt;sq&gt;s probably an app for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as whether you can play rap on an instrument, I&lt;sq&gt;ll start with the assumption that you&lt;sq&gt;re discounting vocals as an instrument.  If you consider Linkin Park rap then check out Eklipse - In the End.  The problem is whether you consider their version rap.  Probably not.  If you play a rap song on a classical instrument (again, discounting vocals), then is it rap at that point?  I&lt;sq&gt;d say no, since I consider rap music to be rapping to music.  But can you have instrumental hip hop music, or instrumental versions of hip hop music?  Absolutely.  Just search for a hip hop song (or just &lt;sq&gt;hip hop&lt;sq&gt;) adding the word instrumental.  Some will be a hip hop song without lyrics.  Some will be a completely different genre version of a hip hop song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;First let me tell that I don&lt;sq&gt;t have any kind of prior knowledge of music. What I have done upto now is, I have listened every album of Eminem and Linkin Park. Nowadays I&lt;sq&gt;m listening 50cent and Yellawolf. I tried to listen old rap of NAS, 2-pac etc but I didn&lt;sq&gt;t find it as good as Eminem&lt;sq&gt;s music is. In this question I will only ask about hip-hop music(Rap). The basic question is, how should I start learning rap music. But I&lt;sq&gt;ll make the question a little branched. I have already searched online for how to learn rap but could not find something satisfactory. The problem is that internet suggest that I do not need any musical knowledge for learning rap. It says just listen to some rappers, take a beat, try your own rap! E.g. &lt;a href=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//www.wikihow.com/Start-Rapping&lt;dq&gt;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; suggest something along these lines. So the questions,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is Rap music?  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question may sound strange, but this question pops up everyday in my mind. Most of the online sources suggest something like, rap is not music or at least not conventional music. Whenever I watch some youtube video people would comment, oh this is not music, they are just talking or looping which is cheating, they stolen a beat and a chorus and made a song. At least wikipedea says that rap is a specific genre of music. So I think rap &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; music.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol start=&lt;dq&gt;2&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do I need to learn conventional music for learning hip-hop music(rap)?   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I searched on internet, how the popular rappers learned rap. What I found is that most of the artists learned it by directly listening the rap music, they understand what the rapper does in the song, recognize their techniques, and finally developed their own techniques, flow and style. I wonder how they make melodic rap then. Do I need to learn conventional music for making melodic rap e.g. just like Eminem&lt;sq&gt;s songs are, like 50 cent&lt;sq&gt;s choruses.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol start=&lt;dq&gt;3&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which books, videos or other resources should I follow?    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another curious and strange question I&lt;sq&gt;d ask is,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol start=&lt;dq&gt;4&lt;dq&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can Rap be played on a musical instrument?  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only need yes/no type answer. A concise explanation would also be fine. The reason I&lt;sq&gt;m asking this strange question is because I want to make sure that what I am going to learn is at least music. If something can be played on a piano or a harmonium then for sure it is music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">29472</str><long name="_version_">1561170572636848128</long><float name="score">4.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.9188504 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.9188504 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6666667 6 0.13353139262452263 4.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">0.1722608037415192</double></doc><doc><arr name="body"><str>{'answer': '&lt;p&gt;The best answers to questions like these are economic in nature, and not confined to any particular musical definitions, because &lt;dq&gt;pop&lt;dq&gt; is always evolving and changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any given point in time, in any given location or culture, &lt;dq&gt;pop&lt;dq&gt; music is the newest emerging style of music that is being commercialized, marketed and sold on a large scale. What you define as &lt;dq&gt;pop&lt;dq&gt; in the USA in 2014 is going to be very different from what is defined as &lt;dq&gt;pop&lt;dq&gt; in the USA in ten or twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another word for &lt;dq&gt;pop music&lt;dq&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;commercial music.&lt;/strong&gt; It is entirely a creation of the 20th century, and it did not exist before the rise of radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;dq&gt;Pop&lt;dq&gt; has meant very different things in every nation in the world where there was commercial broadcast radio. Pop music in Kenya in 1975 was very different than that in Mexico in 1935 or in Italy in 1995. But all forms of pop music have this in common&lt;colon&gt; they are created to earn money in a larger music industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pop music is a music industry phenomenon that began in the early 1900s when commercial radio stations began broadcasting pre-recorded music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then professional music publishing companies began commissioning the composing of specific kinds of music which would be produced and recorded by professional music labels in certain styles. These pieces of music would be specifically tailored to be the kinds of music that particular radio stations would be eager to broadcast to appeal to a certain audience of listeners. This was in turn driven by the kinds of advertisements (commercials) that various manufacturing companies would create and pay the radio stations to broadcast between the playing of pieces of pre-recorded music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened in parallel in different nations and cultures all around the world. In every nation where there was broadcast radio and an economy that would support selling mass-produced recordings, completely different kinds of &lt;dq&gt;pop&lt;dq&gt; would arise and develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, each radio station would play all kinds of music, but as time went on, certain radio stations would specialize in just one genre of music, in order to appeal to a certain narrowly-defined demographic of the listening public, again to attract paid advertisement from certain companies wishing to sell certain specific categories of goods to the public, in order to create a tightly-managed profitable business for the radio station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some nations, radio stations paid royalties to the publishing companies and the record labels whenever a particular piece of pre-recorded music was broadcast. At any rate, the record companies would mass-produce recorded discs (singles and albums) and later cassettes, CDs or other kinds of media, and make them available for sale in local music stores in the areas where a particular radio station broadcast to the public. This was carefully synchronized to marketing campaigns to get those certain pieces of music played on certain radio stations within a certain time frame, to enhance the potential for sales. It was all carefully organized with investments and business and marketing plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the degree that radio stations would specialize in playing a certain style of music that appealed to a certain narrow demographic of listeners, the record labels and publishing companies would oblige by deliberately seeking out and financing musicians who could create music tailored to the desires of those specific radio stations. &lt;strong&gt;Thus the various sub-genres of pop music, everywhere in the world, were created in a kind of feedback loop between broadcast radio and the record labels.&lt;/strong&gt; Styles and genres of pop music always changed and evolved, but always in response to the market pressures of selling recordings and making money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This still goes on today, even though there are many more outlets for marketing and selling music than traditional broadcast radio stations and traditional music stores that sold discs and tapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only two other economic categories of music besides pop music&lt;colon&gt; &lt;strong&gt;folk music&lt;/strong&gt;, which is music that amateurs make for their own enjoyment and which they don&lt;sq&gt;t expect to make much money from, and &lt;strong&gt;classical music&lt;/strong&gt;, which is intellectually sophisticated music that is expensive to create and perform but is paid for by &lt;strong&gt;patronage&lt;/strong&gt;, which is to say the direct infusion of money from wealthy noblemen, governments, churches, corporations and the like. Classical music does not earn a profit overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where did the styles of pop music originate? The earliest pop music in each culture usually was adapted from existing folk music and in some sense, classical music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also always been the case that folk musicians and classical musicians have gotten themselves involved in the commercial music industry, record labels, and broadcast radio, television, and motion pictures. To the extent that they do so, they tend to transform their music from folk or classical into pop, according to the pressures put upon them by the publishing companies and record companies and the music industry, in the hope of profits. It&lt;sq&gt;s all about the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;Today, not all popular music is labeled as pop. To me it seems that pop has become a genre that can be defined by its musical patterns, techniques, and styles. Similar to rock, jazz, and classical music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which are the patterns, techniques, and styles that define pop music as a genre? What makes a pop song what it is? Which are the characteristics of the genre?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems that popularity is no longer a factor, or at least not the most important one, defining Pop music. Which are those musical characteristics that separate Pop from other genres? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clarity, let&lt;sq&gt;s make a distinction between popular music and Pop music, &lt;a href=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm&lt;dq&gt; rel=&lt;dq&gt;nofollow&lt;dq&gt;&gt;using this source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is tempting to confuse pop music with popular music. The New Grove Dictionary Of Music and Musicians, the musicologist&lt;sq&gt;s ultimate reference resource, identifies popular music as the music since industrialization in the 1800&lt;sq&gt;s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class. This would include an extremely wide range of music from vaudeville and minstrel shows to heavy metal. Pop music, on the other hand, has primarily come into usage to describe music that evolved out of the rock &lt;sq&gt;n roll revolution of the mid-1950&lt;sq&gt;s and continues in a definable path to today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question is about Pop music, not popular music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">20506</str><long name="_version_">1561170539012161536</long><float name="score">3.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.701031 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.701031 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6666667 7 0.11778303565638346 3.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">0.003918087595572517</double></doc><doc><arr name="body"><str>{'answer': '&lt;p&gt;I&lt;sq&gt;m not sure where you got spaghetti westerns from, but the examples you&lt;sq&gt;ve given in your question are generally considered to be on the pop side of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dichotomy of &lt;dq&gt;pop vs. classical&lt;dq&gt; or &lt;dq&gt;art music vs. pop music&lt;dq&gt; and the question of what defines those things is truly a complicated one in my mind; in that nearly any definition you can come up with is going to cause disagreement, and many hold that the dichotomy is a false one to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are some distinct and undeniable cultural strokes out there, and the terms continue to be useful despite some artists trying their absolute hardest to obliterate the dividing line, or at least what it means to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;User filzilla has &lt;a href=&lt;dq&gt;http&lt;colon&gt;//music.stackexchange.com/a/16879/133&lt;dq&gt;&gt;already posted&lt;/a&gt; an excellent overview of some of the most important music written in the past few decades, so rather than rehash or add to that, I&lt;sq&gt;m going to try to speak to the definition side of the question in some more concrete terms and attempt to provide some backstory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are aware that a tradition exists of &lt;dq&gt;classical&lt;dq&gt; music; the instrumentalists and singers who go to conservatory to study and build their skills so they can sing at the opera or play in an orchestra all of the well-worn chestnuts by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and the rest of them. What fewer people are aware of, however, is that there is a stylistic lineage in this tradition that has stretched unbroken across time from these household-name composers of old to the present day. Now, this lineage was a fairly tightly-wound braid up until the middle of the 20th century, when some key styles started to diverge from one another before everything shattered into a thousand pieces in the 1970s (the &lt;dq&gt;stellar nursery&lt;dq&gt; mentioned in filzilla&lt;sq&gt;s answer). In other words, it used to be relatively easy to track what the style of present-day music was and where it was headed, but these days no composer really feels beholden to follow in the stylistic footsteps of their teacher, as was previously the norm. The lineage, though now fragmented, it still there; but now new influences are being integrated faster and in more places than we can really keep track of for art music on the whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of this, here are some of the (hopefully) least contentious &lt;dq&gt;traditions&lt;dq&gt; that still serve to differentiate &lt;dq&gt;art music&lt;dq&gt; from &lt;dq&gt;pop music&lt;dq&gt;, understanding that there are always exceptions&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Art music is written so that a &lt;em&gt;piece&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; makes an artistic statement and is seen as the artistic product, not the &lt;em&gt;album&lt;/em&gt;, as tends to be the case with pop music. There are no &lt;dq&gt;singles&lt;dq&gt; in art music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Art music tends to have a division of labor present between the composer and performer. As such, performers must be trained to the highest possible level of musicianship and technique so they are capable of playing whatever is thrown at them. Composer-performers exist, certainly, both in the past and present, but do tend to have the same kind of training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also in the division of labor vein, composers tend to be supported monetarily by commissions, royalties, grants, and sale or rental of performance materials (sheet music), while performers tend to be supported by recording album contracts and the performances themselves. Contrast with pop music, where one artist (often aided by a producer) writes, performs, records, and tours all at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&lt;sq&gt;re at the Grammys or something else that calls itself the &lt;dq&gt;music industry&lt;dq&gt;, it&lt;sq&gt;s probably pop music. If the MacArthur Foundation or someone else is giving you &lt;em&gt;free money&lt;/em&gt; just so you can keep making music (without taking a cut of your royalties), it&lt;sq&gt;s probably art music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;With the obvious exception of opera, a performance of art music is generally focused almost entirely upon the music itself. There is no mood lighting, the stage is bare without distractions, the performers are dressed simply and/or elegantly (&lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; to provide no distractions). Pop music tends to be focused upon five-sensory spectacular impact. Music videos! Costumes! Props! A dress made of meat! Synchronized hip gyration!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, immediately upon coming up with some potential criteria, one starts thinking of exceptions, and I truly mean that for all of the items above. The lines are continually being blurred between concert music, opera, and performance art, people are making pop music that&lt;sq&gt;s artistically fascinating and art music that sounds like pop music, and it&lt;sq&gt;s impossible to pose any definition without someone writing a very long blog post about why your definition is wrong!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently spent an entire semester in a class, the aim of which was to pose this very question; and while much excellent discussion was had, we never really came up with a truly reliable answer (and that was the point). At the end of the day, the musicians and composers and audience members that create and appreciate music out there tend to classify themselves and who they musically associate with on their own, and those who appreciate &lt;dq&gt;both&lt;dq&gt; kinds of music either create their own definitions, classify on a case-by-case basis, or refuse the dichotomy outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course, the term &lt;dq&gt;contemporary art music&lt;dq&gt; still has enough meaning that the people on this site immediately know exactly what you&lt;sq&gt;re talking about, so there must be something, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;...not contemporary pop music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;sq&gt;m doing a brief write up on contemporary art music that&lt;sq&gt;s been written within the last 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the very vague definition my assignment gives is &lt;dq&gt;music written in the last 25 years, that isn&lt;sq&gt;t necessarily well know, but has a lasting effect, and what it can speak to future generations about us and music today&lt;dq&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;sq&gt;m nervous on what constitutes &lt;dq&gt;art music&lt;dq&gt; and not &lt;dq&gt;pop music&lt;dq&gt; as it&lt;sq&gt;s important to my assignment. I&lt;sq&gt;ve been looking at&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck - &lt;dq&gt;Paper Tiger&lt;dq&gt; (Sea Change 2002)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&gt; Great song with lots of traditional instrumentals, but it&lt;sq&gt;s a directly inspired from the song &lt;dq&gt;Melody&lt;dq&gt; by Serge Gainsbourg (Histoire de Melody Nelson 1971). So it&lt;sq&gt;s not exactly an original composition within the last 25 years. And again, could be considered pop music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danger Mouse &amp;amp; Daniele Luppi - &lt;dq&gt;Black&lt;dq&gt;, &lt;dq&gt;The Gambling Priest&lt;dq&gt;, &lt;dq&gt;Her Hollow Ways&lt;dq&gt;, &lt;dq&gt;Roman Blue&lt;dq&gt; (Rome 2011)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&gt; This album is very striking and complex, and more in line what I think my professor is looking for. But is it contemporary art music? A quick search says it&lt;sq&gt;s based on Italian spaghetti westerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate some suggestions on current contemporary art composers and music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">16880</str><long name="_version_">1561170530702196736</long><float name="score">2.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.6618512 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.6618512 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6666667 8 0.1053605156578263 2.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">3.5265832760967967E-4</double></doc><doc><arr name="body"><str>{'answer': '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; People don&lt;sq&gt;t like it because they don&lt;sq&gt;t actually know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been and will always be a stigma against music theory and studying it. Some of the reasons I&lt;sq&gt;ve heard on this very site are&lt;colon&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Music is artistic and no theory can explain art.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;It makes you think rather than play.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;X musician doesn&lt;sq&gt;t know theory so I don&lt;sq&gt;t have to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many more arguments and while I could counter each and every one, it outlines a problem that needs to be addressed. The biggest problem is &lt;strong&gt;people don&lt;sq&gt;t understand what music theory is.&lt;/strong&gt; People take or see an intro music theory where your hand is being held to learn and compose a certiant style and it scares most people away without them seeing a bigger picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music Theory in the simplest is the study of what works and what doesn&lt;sq&gt;t in music. So while there is a formal path for studying the subject, simple things like someone listening to a song and figuring out what you like and what you don&lt;sq&gt;t is also music theory. Every musician I know does this even the ones that speak out against theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people only equate music theory to an intro class that focuses on the classical era which most modern types of western music are rooted in, but there is so much more. There are pop, jazz, blues, and rock music theory classes and books that focus much more on modern songs and deconstructing them so people can learn what works and what doesn&lt;sq&gt;t. People who study music theory in depth eventually tailor their ideas towards what they find works and what doesn&lt;sq&gt;t using what they learned as a foundation for this and utilizes this in what they compose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This to my knowledge is the only subject that has this problem. Even in other artistic fields like film and art the study is extremely important and no one complains about that affecting the artistic value or creativity of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;', 'question': '&lt;p&gt;Music theory is cool. However, I&lt;sq&gt;ve noticed that a few genres of music tend to discourage it. I just read that learning music theory &lt;dq&gt;seems like the antithesis&lt;dq&gt; of being able to improvise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, having the equivalent of a doctorate in music can actually be a disadvantage if you want to get hired as a conductor, because they think you&lt;sq&gt;re too theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anything about learning music theory well that slows down your musical capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'}</str></arr><str name="id">50717</str><long name="_version_">1561170665138028544</long><float name="score">1.0</float><str name="featureVector">1.6500175 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.6500175 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6666667 9 0.09531017980432487 1.0</str><double name="ranker.confidence">0.0</double></doc></result>
