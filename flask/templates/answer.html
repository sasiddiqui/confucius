I\'m also pretty sure Sirius B would be in the night sky (not just in the daytime sky), so it would count.</p><p>I\'d like to poke around a bit more before declaring this answer complete. I think I can show that any point where the Sun is brighter than Sirius must be less than 4.3 light years (and probably much less) away from our solar system, so, unless we discover an star system MUCH closer than Proxima Centauri, there are no exoplanets where our Sun is the brightest star.</p>', question': <p>The brightest star on the night sky is Sirius, here in the Earth. But are there any exoplanets, where the brightest star on the night sky is our sun?</p><br>
