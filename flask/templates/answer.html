<p>What you<sq>re describing is basically the <dq>collapsed star<dq> (Eng) or <dq>frozen star<dq> (Rus) interpretation of black holes that was common prior to the late mid-1960s. It was a mistake.</p><br><br><p>Suppose you are distant and stationary relative to the black hole. You will observe infalling matter asymptotically approaching the horizon, growing ever fainter as it redshifts. Does it mean that matter <dq>clumps<dq> around the horizon? To find out, suppose you throw yourself towards the black hole to try to catch the matter that you see. What you will find is that it fell into the black hole long ago.</p><br><br><p>In other words, the most sensible way to answer whether or not infalling matter clumps on the horizon is to look at the situation from the frame of that infalling matter. And there, it is clear<colon> no, it does not clump, as it crosses the horizon in finite proper time. (As an aside, for a Schwarzschild black hole, falling from rest is exactly Newtonian in Schwarzschild radial coordinate and proper time.)</p><br><br><p>The <dq>comoving viewpoint<dq> was recognized by Oppenheimer and Snyder in 1939, but it was not until the 1960s, with the work of Zel<sq>dovich, Novikov, et al., that it was generally recognized as truly significant in the community. In 1965, Penrose introduced conformal diagrams based on the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (1924/1958) that showed quite clearly that the stellar collapse is not slowed, but instead continues to a singularity. For an overview of the history of this change of viewpoint, cf. Kip Thorne, et al., <em>The Memberane Paradigm</em> (1986). These topics are commonly covered in many relativity textbooks.</p><br><br><p>Ok, but since it still takes an infinite amount time in the frame adapted to a stationary distant observer, does that mean that the horizon never forms in that frame? It does form<colon> the underlying assumption in the argument that it does not would be either that the infalling matter needs to reach the center for the horizon to form or cross a pre-existing horizon to make it expand. But that assumption is simply not true.</p><br><br><p>An event horizon is defined in terms of future lightlike infinity, roughly speaking in terms of whether or not light rays escape if one waits an infinite amount of time. That means the location of the horizon at any time depends on not just what has happened, but also what <em>will</em> happen in the future. In the frame of the distant stationary observer, as matter falls towards the event horizon, it does slow down to asymptotically approach... but the horizon also expands to meet it. Similarly, the initial collapsing matter does not need to collapse all the way to the center for the event horizon to form.</p><br><br><hr><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>How can the finite life-time of the Black hole due to Hawking radiation be made consistant with the infinite amount of time (future) needed for the expansion of the event horizon (in the outer time-frame)? </p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>There<sq>s no need to<colon> [edit]that a particular time coordinate doesn<sq>t cover the full manifold is a fault of the coordinate chart, not of spacetime[/edit].

Would this also mean matter is accumulating just outside its event horizon?  As I understand it, this would be the perspective from outside the black hole.
