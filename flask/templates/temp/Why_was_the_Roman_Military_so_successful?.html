There\'s also specific portion in the text where Vegetius says that sick soldiers should be brought back to health with proper feeding under the care of doctors.However, it\'s important to note that *De Re Militari* is that it is mostly a prescriptive treatise by Vegetius articulating the manner in which the legion *ought* to be run, rather than a record dedicated to documenting how things were *actually* run at the time Vegetius was around to observe them.  In fact, according to the introduction of the 1940 reprint of Lieutenant John Clarke, *De Re Militari* "was little used by the Romans for whom it was written."To provide context for Vegetius\' work, *De Re Militari* alludes to events that took place in 383 (the death of the Emperor Gratian), meaning it was written and published some time after, and this was a time at which the decline of the Roman Empire was already on the horizon, in the form of the civil war that led to Gratian\'s death, as well as invasions throughout the late 4th century (e.g. Germanic invasions in the 370\'s).  The first book of *Re De Militari* is essentially a call for military reform, meaning the things that Vegetius called for (access to clean drinking water for soldiers, proper medical care from doctors) were shouted amidst the death knells of the Roman Empire.  The document was intended to eulogize the Roman legion opining about its better years, but Vegetius can\'t be considered a primary source on the "glory years" of the Roman Empire during the first century more than 300 years before his treatise was published.To also provide appropriate context for the author himself, *De Re Militari* is one of the few military "manuals" from the Roman Empire to have survived to the present day, but its value is questionable according to some historians; according to G.R. Watson in "The Roman Soldier," Vegetius was "neither a historian nor a soldier: his work is a compilation carelessly constructed from material of all ages, a congeries of inconsistencies," so there remains the question of how much of *Re De Militari* actually describes the Roman legion as it once functioned, as opposed to Vegetius\' idealized image of it.</<br/><p>Rank data:</p><br/><p>The Romans were very good in copying tactics and equipment from other peoples.<br>They learned the Phalanx from the Etruscans. The phalanx works like a wall: difficult to get through, but also almost impossible to maneuver. When the Romans met their new enemies the Samnites, a people from the mountains, they saw that the Samnites were armed with long shields and javelins. The short round roman shield gave little protection against the projectiles. Moreover the Samnites operated in much smaller unites than the inflexible phalanx. The first battles against the Samnites weren't a success for the Romans, but the Romans adapted and in the end  (after 3 wars) the Romans subdued the Samnites. <br>The Greek author Polybius gives in his Histories 18.28 a nice comparison between the two different tactics Look here: <a href="http://www.the-romans.eu/books/Polybius-histories-18.php#28">http://www.the-romans.eu/books/Polybius-histories-18.php#28</a>.<br>The gladius the famous Spanish short sword was later adopted.
