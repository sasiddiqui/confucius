But I will give a short answer to a wide topic.</p><br><br><p>The roman legions was well trained and had discipline, they were paid professionals with weathered veterans teaching the younger ones. Comparing that to the other general armies of the time which were often ill trained, not as well equipped and in many cases fought against their will it is not hard to imagine the outcome of battle.  </p><br><br><p>Other armies were much more so individualists, where the roman legion was a unit of well composed hardened soldiers. Also remember, back then the premises of battle was different, much more chaotic and not as good "widespread" communication. If one army's front line would be breached it could cause their whole army to collapse, causing panic and turn in to a mass flight. With the strong moral in the roman legions (and the hard punishments upon failing the commander) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimation_(Roman_army)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimation_(Roman_army)</a>) this made the roman legions a successful army for a long time.</p><br><br><p>(another link discussing a bit of what I've said <a href="http://www.ancientmilitary.com/roman-military.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ancientmilitary.com/roman-military.htm</a>)</p><br></div><h4>Retrieve Data: </h4><div style="width:100%;height:250px;line-height:3em;overflow:scroll;padding:5px;background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#B0A2AA;scrollbar-base-color:#EFEFEF;"><p>The question is illogical because there was no such thing as a viking in the days of the undivided Roman Empire or of the Western Roman Empire.</p><br><br><p>A viking is defined as a Scandinavian pirate or sea raider during the period of about 795 to 1100 AD at the widest.  It is always incorrect to capitalize viking and use it as an ethnic word instead of an occupational word. Thus it is impossible for western Romans before 476 AD to ever encounter vikings since no Scandinavians ever went on viking raids to Roman territories until after the western Roman Empire fell.</p><br><br><p>But Roman citizens and subjects and Scandinavians did meet sometimes.</p><br><br><ol><br><li><p>For example, Roman artifacts have been unearthed from Scandinavian Roman era sites.  Each artifact was either transported to Scandinavia in stages, passing from one trader to another, or else was transported to Scandinavia in one long trip.  In the latter case, either Scandinavians acquired Roman artifacts in Roman territory, thus meeting Roman citizens and subjects, or else Roman traders and/or diplomats transported them to Scandinavia, thus meeting Scandinavians.</p></li><br><li><p>And there were Saxon sea raiders who raided the "Saxon Shore" of Roman Britain and Gaul during the late empire.  In those days the Romans used the word "Saxon" to refer to not only Saxons, but other northern Germanic peoples who raided Roman lands by sea.  Thus it is possible that some of those "Saxons" were Angles, Jutes, and other Scandinavians.  If there were any Scandinavians among those "Saxons" making proto-viking type raids on Roman lands, they might have used the word "viking" to describe their occupation.<br/><br>Of course modern historians would not approve of using the word "viking" to describe such raiders centuries before the age of vikings.</p></li><br><li><p>And as written in andejons' answer, the Roman battles with the Cimbrians may have been with migrants from Scandinavia.</p></li><br><li><p>There were a lot of Germanic mercenaries in the Roman army, and <strong>SOME</strong> of them <strong>MIGHT</strong> have been Scandinavians.</p></li><br><li><p>Radagaisus, a Gothic King, led a horde of barbarians in an invasion of Italy in 405-406 before being defeated by Flavius Stilicho.  The invaders included Alans, Sueves, and Vandals.  I have read that some of the barbarians came from far north, and thus it is <strong>POSSIBLE</strong> that <strong>SOME</strong> of them were born in Scandinavia.</p></li><br><li><p>And considering that there were contacts between Romans and Indians and Chinese, there could have been some unrecorded contacts of various types between Romans and Scandinavians.</p></li><br></ol><br><br><p>So the answer is vikings no, Scandinavians yes.</p><br></div>
