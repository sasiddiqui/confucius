<p>I agree with moscafj<sq>s general answer: there is no pan-Italian "rule" like this in Italian cuisine.  It<sq>s common to mix the two in many Italian regions, and it<sq>s certainly common in other world cuisines.  </p><br><br><p>On the other hand, I wouldn<sq>t dismiss this story out-of-hand or as some quirk of one crazy roommate.</p><br><br><p>I grew up near an old Italian neighbor, daughter of Italian immigrants.  Her mother-in-law also lived with her, a direct Italian immigrant born around 1900 (immigrated sometime before mid-century).  It was an <strong>absolute rule</strong> in their house that onion and garlic should <em>never</em> be combined in the same dish.  And yes, they associated this with "the Old Country."</p><br><br><p>Alas, I don<sq>t know what region they were from, and they both died long ago.  And I wouldn<sq>t pass on this anecdote here except I did a few quick internet searches and discovered that a few people have asked similar things on various internet forums concerning Italian cuisine.  And both <a href="http://www.mamalisa.com/blog/do-italians-from-italy-cook-onions-and-garlic-together-in-the-same-pot/">Mark Bittman</a> and <a href="http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1806672">Gino D<sq>Acampo</a> have apparently passed on tales that Italian cooks have told them the same thing.  (I didn<sq>t track down links to the original sources, but I have no reason to doubt these forum posts are simply making this stuff up.)</p><br><br><p>I<sq>ve eaten food in Italy that clearly contained both.  I know Italians who like cooking, and I<sq>ve never heard them talk about this.  On the other hand, I<sq>ve heard this particular "rule" a couple times, and it seems <em>only</em>  associated with Italian cuisine.  I<sq>m not really interested in trying to track down more information on it, but it sounds to me like it<sq>s at least part of cooking "lore" for <em>some</em> Italians, perhaps from a particular region or something.</p><br><br><hr><br><br><p>EDIT: Just for one Italian source which seems to reference the issue, <a href="http://www.lacucinaitaliana.it/news/in-primo-piano/quando-aglio-e-quando-cipolla/">see here</a>.  After a discussion of separate uses for onion and garlic, the question of whether to use them together comes up: </p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>Il dubbio, a questo punto, viene: Ã¨ possibile utilizzare aglio e<br>  cipolla insieme? La questione divide da sempre gli appassionati di<br>  cucina.</p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>Basically, this passage strongly implies that there are passionate cooks out there who argue about whether it<sq>s even possible to combine the two.  (The link goes on to argue that it is possible, but nevertheless it references this question as if it were a common dispute.)  The opening paragraph also implies there are traditional fixed rules that dictate the specific occasions when they could be properly combined.</p><br><p>I had an Italian flatmate once who was on the brink of lynching me when he saw I used garlic and onion in one dish. He said that - at least in Italian cuisine - thats an absolute no-no. You can use both, but never together. </p><br><br><p>Especially with something like Spinach, I think that combination is quite nice though. Is this an Italian kitchen "rule", a general thing, or was he just misinformed?</p><br>
