                "answer": "<p>Great question. You are correct that the song is in A and that E is the V chord. That being said, try not to think of the Eb diminished chord as a substitution chord, because it actually isn<sq>t one. And second of all, from a theory perspective, I would encourage you to view this chord as a D# diminished chord and not an Eb diminished chord. I am aware that both of the chords have the exact same notes in them, but this particular chord functions as a D# chord and here is why... The overall cadence [or return to the I chord] here is IV V I, or D, E, A. The D# chord is placed between the IV [or pre-dominant] chord and the V [dominant] chord and provides better voice leading into the V chord. It creates a lot of tension that wants to resolve to notes in the V chord. This is why, in Jazz, diminished chords are often used for a short amount of time... they are very unstable and your ear wants to hear them resolve quickly. You will seldom hear a full bar of a diminished chord for that very reason. The tensions and resolutions of this D# diminished chord at hand are as follows... The D#, which is played in the bass, resolves a half step up to the E [which is the root of the V chord, beautiful!].  The A resolves a half step down to the G#. And the C resolves a half step down the the B natural. Notice how there are three movements of only a half step when moving to the V chord.  Because of this phenomenon, there was a time in music when this <dq>D# chord<dq> wouldn<sq>t have even been called a chord, but just voice leading. Since the chants of olden days, we have since distilled such harmonic movement into things called chords but originally they were simply voice leading that made for smoother transitions between harmonies. That is why in this particular instance the D# chord wouldn<sq>t be seen as a substitution, because it isn<sq>t substituting for anything... it is transitioning between two block sounds. I hope this helps! <br></p>",

People also tend to play vinyl much louder and systems set up for vinyl tend to have independent (as well as analog) mixing systems in the rack. Hearing is like a bell curve - it is exactly true to say that louder music sounds clearer to the human ear. Listening to a record is also something usually done all the way through and very often bands will list their tracks on an album in an order that compliments each other well which also contributes to the overall experience. Vinyl (ultimately recorded on tape) is also purely an analog system - analog meaning at its most base form of the word <dq>one thing taking the place of another<dq> - there is no signal reprocessing or re-interpretation outside of what the user does to the original track which is an <dq>analog<dq> - a direct physical representation - of the original sound waves produced when recording as apposed to a digital emulative representation of that sound. This is not to imply that analog music is not mixed - far to the contrary - but the data being manipulated is a physical representation of a vibration at a point in time (ultimately transferred to the vinyl) and not simply a reproduced copy of that vibration by a device which must interpret a digital signal as would be true with digital music.<br><br>Drawbacks of vinyl include;<br><br>No exact track selection when desired<br><br>Records are easily scratched or damaged often by the very equipment used to play them<br><br>Turntables are extremely sensitive to vibration and movement - jumping on a wooden floor will likely skip one from halfway across the room<br><br>Not all records are compatible with all players though players exist which can play almost any size or speed record<br><br>Vinyl is a plastic which means that any record has a built-in lifetime from the time it is pressed.

So stretching that metaphor<colon> its like if for the time being we decided that the ace of spades always stays in the same place but shuffled the rest of the deck.  When we get tired of that we will move onto the 2 of spades.</p>",

There are only so many instruments and combinations of instruments. In the last century we had recording technology to advance music and now we have digital effects to explore. I just described thousands of years of musical evolution, but my point is that each new way music evolves becomes less related to the actual pitch content and more about the timbre (sound color). <br><br>Returning to the deck of cards metaphor, 10 shuffled decks of cards may have 10 different sequences, but they are all perceived the same by us -- 4 suits of the same card values put in slightly different orders. To counter this in music, we kept adding more suits to the deck, but the fundamental structure of 12 pitches is underlying and completely explored territory at this  point. <br><br>I<sq>m not sure that I believe my own argument,  but I gave it a try.</p>",

That<sq>s the rhythmic <dq>math<dq> side. It<sq>s like really free form jazz with a rock base (and bass lol). The melodic side of math core can be pretty excruciating to people who enjoy western melody. But it<sq>s similar to the mindset of building and progressing in the way classical music did. There would be an initial idea and a final destination and it may not matter what-the-fuck-all happens in between so long as it maintains some concept of the initial idea (by repeating something similar in any way) and incorporating it as a supporting characteristic in the final sections of the piece. However, now, we do it with screaming guitarists from Scandinavia and a double kick pedal. And thrashing vocals that may or may not allow a singer to work in the industry for more than 3 years safely. It<sq>s very much an exercise in patience, to learn those songs. There is a place in music for kids who still have to read the lyrics to ever learn them. This is just where that culture has ended up. Common occurrences are odd time signatures, reaching tonal expressions (not always in key), and seemingly random rhythmic gestures inside otherwise normal progressions. A lot of stuff that calls itself math rock may be a reach. But to a non-musician, the range of melody can often be misleading.

They<sq>re the exact same set of notes on the piano. But, when you<sq>re playing music and there<sq>s a key change, it<sq>s easier to write and make the transition when you you use the same sets of accidentals. For example, if you<sq>re in F# major (6 sharps), it<sq>s easier to transition to C# Major instead of Db Major. Switching from flats to sharps feels weird and is a little awkward to the performer.<br><br>The other part is more abstract and theory based. There<sq>s usually a reason for a key change, in that the new key functions in a way that is related to the old key. So that relationship is better preserved and made obvious maintaining the same usage of sharps or flats. Like in the previous example, going from F# to C# is a perfect 5th and C# is found in the key of F#, but a Db is foreign to the key of F#. <br><br>Back to function (and this gets more theoretical) C# supports the F# because it is 5th degree of the scale. The 5th of the scale is really important and is called the <dq>dominant.<dq> So when the key changes from F# to C# for a while, that <dq>dominant<dq> relationship is better preserved visually by using C#s instead of Dbs.<br><br>Edit<colon>  this is all based on our European system of music where the term <dq>octave<dq> implies that there are only 7 notes in a scale/key, and the 8th note (the octave), is where they start repeating again. So, to make the music easy to read, you want to use one of each note of the scale in each key.

It<sq>s the same with tuning - no matter how you tune an instrument, certain intervals will always be a little off. The keys have the same spacing between them on a piano because pianos are tuned in equal temperament, so each semitone is the same distance apart. However, that means that the thirds and sixths are never quite in tune. String instruments are tuned using just temperament, so their fifths are in tune with one another, but the greater the distance between two octaves, the less in tune they will be on open strings. There are tons of these little tuning quagmires, and tons of partial solutions - just like all the different map projections of the globe.<br><br>Because of these tuning obstacles, and the fact that some keys sit better on certain instruments, composers have been inclined, for example, to write sad music in D minor just because it worked, until it became a cultural norm. [Here](http<colon>//www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/courses/keys.html) are some descriptions of norms for more keys.</p>",

Make note though that also in this example the 9 is not an extension but an inner voice. If you want this sound go to the piano and voice the resolution like this... Play an E in the base with the left hand. In the right hand play an E an octave above the E in the left hand, an F# a whole step above the E, a G a half step above the F#, and then a B a third above the G.

Play things like quarter note quarter note quarter note 8th note 8th note. Etc. you want to really emphasize what each note division sounds like with the metronome.<br><br>What also helps is putting on a simple 8 bar loop drum part. Logic<sq>s drummer feature is great for this. Put on a drum beat you like, start slow and at first just play a note and match the rhythm. Having a drum beat makes it a little easier to hear the position of the 8 bars. Once that seems easier, make slight variations. This could be emphasizing a note on certain hits or adding another note. Again play super simple riffs and try improvising. If you have a DAW, play while watching the play head as it goes along the 8 bars. This will force you to know where you are. If you<sq>re playing simple enough, you won<sq>t need to focus on your instrument.<br><br>This will get repetitive but just slowly start improvising little bits in. <br><br>Once you kind of feel the rhythm, come up with a simple riff you can play on the first, third, fifth, and 7th bar. <br><br>Once that gets simple and repetitive, improvise bits in between your riff. Maybe a quarter note here, maybe a few 8th notes there but make sure you land on your riff perfectly.<br><br>It sounds boring and it can be but what<sq>s going to help make it more interesting is that you<sq>ll notice that you<sq>ll get better at doing it. <br><br>That<sq>s the goal.

The producer might also be automating an amp simulator of some kind so when the lower harmonic comes in, it also gets distorted in natural ways, beyond just a plugin glitch. A lot of the sounds you hear in modern electronic music are side effects of a plug-in designed to perform another function, but our ears are used to the distortion and producers/editors can employ these glitches at will for creative purposes.</p>",

First, the sound reproduction depends on both the equipment playing the audio and the source of the audio.<br><br>I<sq>ll start with the source first. Generally, the more data you have to work with, the better. This means analog recordings, .wav files, and lossless compressed files like FLAC or .m4a files. These retain all of the perceptible audio that is in the recording. Both CDs and Vinyl are this type of source. Lossy files, such as .mp3 files are the types you want to avoid if you<sq>re looking for good quality, because they have perceptible differences in the audio. A computer generally compresses an imported CD with the .mp3 format. If you<sq>re wary of the file types, downloaded music is just as good as analog.<br><br>That being said, if you<sq>re playing the files or vinyl through a system that introduces noise or alters the sound in a bad way, then the file types won<sq>t matter much. Check out r/audiophile or r/vinyl for more info.<br><br>Edit<colon> Also, electronic music isn<sq>t recorded on analog equipment so vinyl and CD quality will always be identical, except for the cracks and pops of dust in the record grooves.

Popular music is often very hard to transcribe to sheet music as it has some idiosyncrasies that appear in performance BEFORE everything i transcribed.  Therefor variation is allowed but IMHO usually the attempt is made to mimick the original performance so... its kind of a moot point.    In more improvisational forms like jazz or blues you have a framework with considerably more variables.   In a classical environment the issue is often what is provided and what isnt.  This depends on the composer.  Some composers are meticulous about what dynamics/articulation/phrasing etc.. they want.. some more lax.  This also can be influenced by publishers editions which can come long after the composer is dead who can add standardized interpretations. (a great example of this is i once performed a version of the Halleluiah Chorus starting very quiet... which is abnormal.. but being as Handel didnt write dynamics... interpretation is allowed. ) Source<colon> I<sq>m an opera singer.   </p>",
