                "answer": "<p>I am not totally familiar with Jovian physics, so I can only give an answer from a broad planetary perspective.<br><br>Currently, there are three main theories on the formation of giant planets. First and most highly regarded is core accretion. In this model, the genesis of giant planets begins the same as the well-known formation of the terrestrial planets, in which rocky grains continuously coagulate to produce a large body. This continues until the object reaches a critical mass (~10 Earth masses), at which point it begins to experience runaway accretion of gases. This continues until the protoplanetary disk becomes depleted around the orbit of the nascent planet, by which point it has gained perhaps at least 100 Earth masses of gases but not much more solid material.<br><br>The other two theories are quite similar. First is disk instability, where the gas mass of the protoplanetary disk is massive enough to fragment and collapse into a gaseous planet on its own, without much need for accretion. The second I am not aware of a particular name for, but the mechanism is that the planet forms in the same way that a star would, by collapse of bubbles of gas in the protostellar nebula (this is best compared to the formation of binary stars).<br><br>The three models produce planets that are similar on the outside (massive, mostly composed of light gases, often Hydrogen), but differ most in that core accretion planets have fairly large metallic cores - solid, though highly pressurised - while the others are expected to have no significant metallic cores.<br><br>The relative importance of these methods is crucial for understanding many things about planetary systems, but it is very difficult to determine what lies at the centre of a giant planet indirectly because they contribute only a small fraction of the total mass of the planet. Currently the solar system planets are the only ones that it is possible to directly determine core masses for with good precision. They are *expected* to have cores because core accretion does the best job at explaining most features associated with giant planets in general as well as the solar system planets, but actual observation is sorely needed.<br><br>>That seems like a lot of rocks.<br><br>You would be surprised. For one, little of that mass is actually accreted, because Jupiter is more effective at scattering bodies than accreting them. A good example of this is in modern comets; changes in cometary orbits due to Jupiter are a regular occurrence, but a very small number of those orbit shifts result in impacts on the planet. Second, the amount of mass that has been accreted by Jupiter for its entire life after its formation is calculated to be miniscule-to-negligible compared to its 318 Earth masses. For that reason it is not expected that a coreless giant planet can <dq>create<dq> a core of the caliber that results from core accretion, because post-formation mass accretion is much too ineffective.</p>",

Over time, this material began to collide and stick together, forming larger clumps that could collide with other larger clumps and gradually gather more and more matter. All of the planets in our Solar System began to form this way, but close to the Sun the temperature was too high for volatiles (gases like water and methane) to condense, so only the materials with a higher melting point (and higher density) were able to form at this point. The gas giants on the other hand, formed far enough away from the Sun that the temperature was cool enough for these volatile gases to condense, and form these huge, less dense planets.<br><br>[Source](https<colon>//www.spaceanswers.com/solar-system/why-are-planets-closer-to-the-sun-more-dense/)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m not an astronaut, but I am ex-NASA and currently with an astronomical observatory.  I<sq>ll give a shot at some of these...<br><br>1. While there is no sound in space (because there are too few molecules to let sound travel) the sun indeed makes sound. To quote the wiki <dq>The entire Sun vibrates from a complex pattern of acoustical waves, much like a bell.<dq>  [Here is a youtube video](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=9URQW_hZ-vo) where scientists converted the vibrations into an audio signal. How loud is it?  Very loud.  The sun is VERY big (you can fit 1 million earths in the sun) - big sun, big sound. But again, that sound does not travel very far due to few molecules in space. BTW, technically the sun does not <sq>burn<sq>.  It is a self-contained fusion reaction - which is not the same thing as fire (which requires an external, combustible, fuel source).<br><br>2. Astronauts are normal people just like you and me.  So yes, they have families, houses, pets, etc. The only way they are not like you and me, is that they get to go to space for their job (I just get to peer at space for mine).<br><br>3. It is important that when in space - you have lots of things to occupy your time.  On the ISS this is mostly spent doing a variety of scientific, behavioral, and environmental experiments.  Additionally there is repair and ongoing maintenance of the ISS. There, of course, is also the routine cleaning, food, sleeping, exercise, etc that we all need.<br><br>4.  No, comets have tails because of solar wind. Far out from the sun, a comet has little to no tail - because it is cold and everything is frozen.  As it approaches the sun, it begins to warm up and ice turns to vapor.  The vapor is then driven by the solar wind, producing a tail. (Hint... if it were gravity producing the tail - the tail would point towards the sun... but in reality, the tail points away from the sun due to the solar wind being produced by the sun. [See more here](http<colon>//spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-solar-system/comet-power.html))<br><br>5. This is a good question because the answer is not fully known.  Obviously, you can<sq>t stand on a gas giant as the gravity is too high (it would crush you).  But, let<sq>s pretend anyway.  Is a gas giant gas - all the way through?  Probably not.  Why?  Two reasons - the further toward the center of the planet you go, the larger the pressure - at some point that pressure will solidify the gasses.  The second reason, gas giants are constantly bombarded by asteroids, etc.  These are rocky/metallic - what happens?  While they may be largely vaporized and turn into gas - some components may survive to create a rocky core.  However, the overall answer to your question is No - as any core (if there is one) is small and at the highly pressurized center.<br><br>6. Considering the diversity of life on earth - they could look like just about anything.<br><br>7.  Well, Voyager 1 looks way different from other spacecraft we have created - so the answer would be No.  Even our own spacecraft look different from each other.  (Another point here is we have yet to discover alien life.) <br><br>Hope this helps!  (BTW... all REALLY great questions!

They were only noticed because astronomers were attempting to match up visible objects with sources that were strong emitters of radio waves (the radio telescope was a relatively new invention). A lot of the radio sources turned out to look like normal stars, but nothing else was like what you would expect from a star. The name quasar comes from the term <dq>Quasi Stellar Object<dq>. Spectrograms of these objects were obviously not stellar in nature but it took some years before telescopes were able to confirm that quasars were embedded in distant galaxies. For many years there was a major controversy over whether quasars were within the Milky Way or not (there is an episode of the original series of Star Trek where they come across a quasar) and astronomer Halton Arp maintained until his death that their redshift was not caused by their distance. Now we know that a quasar is one of a class of objects that we call Active Galactic Nuclei. It seems that some of the different classes of AGN<sq>s may evolve over time into one another in some cases. In some cases it is a matter of it living in a different environment. In other cases the difference is a matter of perspective. Quasars emit narrow jets of material and radiation along an axis. If we happen to be looking directly into a jet we see what is called a Blazar when from any other position in the universe it would just look like a normal quasar. The existence of Black Holes was not taken very seriously until they became necessary to explain what is going on in a quasar.</p>",

The courses are rigorous, the professors expect your very best effort. It will be more or less assumed that you intend to do research with your degree, which will mean 4 years of grad school more than likely.<br><br>Why is there so much teaching amongst astronomy graduates? Well, a lot of time teaching goes hand-in-hand with research. You have some research you want to do. A university is willing to hire you and let you do your research, but you also have to teach. If you don<sq>t want to do research, and didn<sq>t go to grad school, teaching is still a good option, especially if you don<sq>t want to go to grad school, but another option may be telescope operating. If you want to get in to that, Arizona would be a REALLY good option, because you will have the chance to operate on multiple research grade telescopes in your undergraduate career. I mean, you barely have to try.<br><br>You can also combine the astronomy major with something else, say, journalism. We need great science journalists. Or maybe you could stick with your major, and minor in astronomy. Maybe there<sq>s a place for someone with that background.<br><br>Me, personally, I<sq>m into outreach. I have actually switched majors to general studies. I cannot recommend this, as I<sq>m pretty terrified myself of what people will think. It<sq>s sort of a cheat degree.

I have a lot of insight as a student, and a student who<sq>s worked for NOAO and Steward Observatory. I<sq>d love to chat about it. Feel free to pm me if you have *any questions*.

Radio communication is viable over interstellar distances given enough power and suitable antennas, but it takes a long time for light to travel through interstellar space, and without direct contact, it is difficult to know which frequencies people are transmitting on and the encoding scheme of their signals.  <br><br>And it may be that interstellar travel is simply so expensive and energy-intensive that technological civilizations simply never bother with it.  Certainly just the raw energy requirements to get a spaceship going fast enough to permit traveling across interstellar space within a (ship-frame) human lifetime is pretty staggering, and fueling such a ship may simply never be practical.  For example, if you want a human-crewed ship to travel 100 ly, you should probably be thinking about a ship-frame journey of ~10 yr, barring suspended animation.  This means that our time dilation factor, or <dq>gamma<dq>, needs to be about 10.  The kinetic energy of such a highly relativistic ship is roughly gamma * m * c^2 .  For the Space Shuttle, m ~ 2,000 tonnes.  This corresponds to a kinetic energy of ~1.7E24 J, or as much energy as the Sun puts out in about 1/100 of a second.  It<sq>s also equivalent to the explosive energy contained in roughly 1/3 of a petaton of TNT.  But of course you also need fuel, and you need to accelerate that fuel, and there are inefficiency losses, etc.  The whole thing just snowballs for any energy source we know of.<br><br>But then again, maybe there is some unknown energy source we can tap into (unlikely), or some way of circumventing the light speed barrier (unliklier still), with all the time travel baggage that implies.  Or something else that makes interstellar travel much more practical, or at least doable as more than a theoretical exercise.  Nobody knows.  So, the only answer I can truthfully give to your question is a shrug, but I would lean towards the second option.</p>",

I suggest you look into some programming and statistics courses, even if only as electives, as these are valuable tools in any research career. <br><br>From personal experience, I can say talk to your advisor. Like weekly. Annoy them with your presence. I saw my general advisor like four times, they had no idea what I needed, and neither did I. I wasted time in creative writing, archaeology and others because they were <dq>interesting<dq> to me. Everything I learned in those classes could have been learned from a few books off Amazon, and not blown a semester and thousands of dollars better spent on maths and reaching my goals. <br><br>As a career, there is research, teaching (often a payment to the piper for funding), all depending on how you chose your specialty, be it observational or theoretical. Be prepared to wrestle every funding cent that is available from hands that would rather spend it on practical applications. Astronomy projects are usually not cheap if they rely on new instruments, and materials science and chemistry (which provide income via patents) are seen as better investments by the powers that be. This is from a professor I had, though they might have just been bitter about their career state. <br><br>But like I said, I strongly encourage you to talk to your advisor, and find a mentor in the field you want to work in, make sure you aren<sq>t wasting time on electives you don<sq>t need, and be good at math.

                "answer": "<p>Since you<sq>re in high school, it<sq>s important to focus on getting good at math and physics as much as you can now, and letting your teachers know it. Here<sq>s what an ideal path would look like<colon><br><br>- **Step 1**, high school<colon> Get good high school grades, especially in math and science. If it all possible, try to take AP Calculus and AP Physics your senior year, and do well. Get to know your math and science teachers, let them know your aspirations, talk with them after class so you stand out and they<sq>ll later write you good recommendations for undergrad.<br><br>- **Step 2**, undergrad<colon> Get into a good undergrad university, particularly one well known for its physics program. Continue taking lots of math and science courses and excelling at them. Get to know your professors, go to their office hours, find a professor whose physics (or maybe astronomy) research interests you and ask if they need any undergrad research assistants. By your junior year, start taking notice of which grad schools have astronomers that are very well known for research that fascinates you. If possible, try to get one paper published during undergrad. Get a major in physics. For your minor, go for something related that will help you later, such as astronomy, math, computer science (if you<sq>re more into theory), statistics (if you<sq>re more into observation), optics or electrical engineering (if you<sq>re more into instrumentation).<br><br>- **Step 3**, applying to grad school<colon> Apply to grad schools that specialize in your chosen research topic. Have your undergrad professors write you great recommendations, especially those that you<sq>ve done research for. Try to do well on the Physics GRE Subject test - it<sq>s your combination of undergrad research experience, great recommendations, good grades, and GRE scores that will let you get in to top grad schools.<br><br>- **Step 4**, grad school<colon> When in grad school, focus on research as early as possible. Grad-level classes are important for learning the basics, but ultimately your research will matter much more in the long-run. You may end up switching research topics while in grad school, which is perfectly fine, but ultimately try to end up in a research field that is new and at the cutting edge of astronomy. Go to as many conferences as possible presenting your research. Very importantly, try to network with as many astronomers at other schools in your research field as possible, since those will be the folks who hire you later. Publish as many papers as you can. Try to get your own grant funded while in grad school. Expect to spend at least 5 - 7 years getting a PhD. If you<sq>ve done your networking well, you should already have a postdoctoral position lined up before handing in your thesis. Get used to eating ramen noodles, because you<sq>re not going to be paid much during grad school.<br><br>- **Step 5**, postdoc<colon> Do at least one 3-year postdoc (though you<sq>ll probably need to do at least two) working with another leader in your research field at a different university. Be open to moving every few years to wherever the leaders in your field are. Publish as much as you possibly can during this period, continuing to get your name out there both in journals and at conferences. Get your own funding from a grant you<sq>ve written. Serve on as many NASA panels as you can, both for networking, and so you know what kind of grant proposals get funded.<br><br>- **Step 6**, applying to faculty positions<colon> Hope that somewhere, some university is looking for a tenure-track faculty member that specializes in your field - if you<sq>ve chosen a very new, cutting-edge field of research, there should at least be a couple opportunities. That said, the faculty application process is brutally competitive...it<sq>s not uncommon to have at least 200 applicants to a single faculty position. Make sure that you<sq>re one of the leaders in your field so that you are the obvious hire.<br><br>- **Step 7**, faculty<colon> Now that you<sq>re new faculty, try to take on as much responsibility as possible. Continue publishing like crazy, getting multiple grants, start mentoring grad and undergrad students, teach lots of intro to astronomy classes, do lots of astronomy outreach, take on administrative duties in your department. With any luck, the combination of excelling at all those things will help you get tenure when you evaluation comes due.<br><br>Source<colon> Astronomy PhD who got to Step 6.</p>",

Space keeps going on and on; the farther you travel from where you started, the more space you discover. Time, however, is more bounded. There may be an infinite amount of space in our universe, but as we understand it, there has been a determinate amount of time since the big bang, therefore a finite amount of time for events to occur in that space.<br><br>Then there<sq>s the matter of space itself. Given an infinite expanse of both space *and* time (or, more accurately, either spacetime, matter/energy or both), everything that can happen, does. And our current understanding does suggest that there is an infinite amount of space, however, there is no evidence to suggest that our universe contains an infinite amount of matter. In contrast, we believe that when spacetime was created in the big bang it was populated with a fixed amount of energy and matter. As space itself expands, the density of that matter and energy decreases.<br><br>So, to answer your question, in a theoretical universe with infinite time and/or an infinite amount of matter and/or energy (not just space, but matter/energy with which to fill that space), yes, everything that can happen, does.

Well, the answer is the same color it is, because the reason it is emitting is because it is behaving roughly like a [blackbody](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) at some temperature.

I will post it here too<colon><br><br>> Let<sq>s actually calculate how big a telescope would need to be to do what you ask. Let<sq>s say we need a telescope that can resolve a continent on an Earth-like planet orbiting our nearest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri. Let<sq>s say the continent is about the size of the United States<colon> about 3000 miles or about 4800 kilometers. If this Earth-like planet is orbiting Proxima Centauri, then it is about 4.2 light years away, or about 4e13 km. So, on an angular scale, that continent subtends an angle of 4800/4e13 ~ 1.2e-12 radians or about 6.9e-9 degrees.<br>> <br>> Physics tells us that to resolve something at a wavelength lambda that subtends an angle of theta radians, you need a telescope of at least a diameter D where<br>> <br>> theta = 1.22 lambda / D<br>> <br>> Rearranging that, we get<br>> <br>> D = 1.22 lambda / theta<br>> <br>> So, assuming we wanted to look at this planet in optical light (lambda ~ 550 nanometers) and resolve a continent that subtends an angle theta = 1.2e-12 radians, we would need a telescope with a diameter D = 560,000 meters. That is gigantic!<br>> <br>> There are other hurdles that one would need to overcome, but just needing a telescope this big is the largest problem.<br>> <br>> There are some advances to solving this problem using a technique called interferometry where you can use multiple, smaller telescopes spread out and achieve the same angular resolution as a larger telescope without actually building a telescope that big. This is done all the time with radio light, but the technology still isn<sq>t reliable enough for a large-scale optical interferometer.</p>",

These clumps collide and merge as the cloud collapses, and each new clump has the average velocity of the clumps that formed it. In this way, the random motions of the original cloud become more orderly as the cloud collapses, changing the cloud from its original lumpy shape into a rotating, flattened disk with nearly circular orbits. This process does indeed conserve angular momentum, for the rotating disk still has the same total angular momentum as the original cloud. <br></p>",

Once in orbit, a systems check is generally perfomed, then a second burn is performed to put you into a solar orbit that intersects the path of the destination body (assuming more complicated maneuvers such as gravity assists are not required).

However, not for the reason you think.  Remember that distance translates to time.  The farther you look, the farther in the past you are seeing.  We can not see, with optical telescopes, past 380,000 years after the Big Bang because light could not persist until then.  However, the first stars did not form until hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang.  Thus indeed, it is possible for us to *see* before galaxies were born (by studying the CMB) - however, it is not possible for us to see back to the big bang using optical techniques.<br><br>Edit 2<colon> Let me take another stab at showing the concept of an infinite structure with no center.<br><br>To do this you will need<colon><br><br>* A thread, about 2 feet long<br>* Masking tape (or similar)<br><br>Join and tape the ends of the thread such that you now have a ring of thread.<br><br>Here are the rules<colon><br><br>* The thread ring **is** the universe.

The thing to keep in mind though is that a lot of us are worried about this possibility, and are working to spread humanity beyond Earth as a result. Zubrin/Wagner/Clarke shared the story of arctic exploration in [**The Case for Mars**](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_for_Mars). The idea isn<sq>t that we<sq>ll make some huge jump to Andromeda or wherever with current technologies. Instead, we<sq>ll form colonies centered near Earth (Mars, skies of Venus), and then to expand the concept, go past the sun (Proxima Centauri b, Epsilon Eridani, etc.). Then those become the new centers we expand from in a similar fashion. Tau Ceti, for instance, is an easier jump from Epsilon Eridani than it is from Earth.<br><br>I<sq>d hope we have these done in the next 200 years, so if one of the calamities does strike, homo sapiens sapiens will at least have a disaster recovery plan in place. The problem though is that we<sq>ll probably top out around 10ly per jump as even at the speed of light, that<sq>s still a massive jump. If we can<sq>t hit light speed instantaneously we have to spend time getting up to that speed, and THEN reverse the process so we and stop and settle the place. So a 10ly trip could be 20 year trip, one way, by the time that is done. A 30 year old on a round trip and could retire when they get back!</p>",

After the supernova faded, the identification was definitely confirmed by Sanduleak -69\u00b0 202 having disappeared. This was an unexpected identification, because at the time blue supergiants were not considered susceptible to a supernova event in existing models of high mass stellar evolution. Many models of the progenitor have attributed the color to its chemical composition, particularly the low levels of heavy elements, among other factors. There was some speculation that the star might have merged with a companion star prior to the supernova. However, it is now widely understood that blue supergiants are natural progenitors of supernovae, although there is still speculation that the evolution of such stars requires mass loss involving a binary companion. It is of note that the supernova of the blue giant Sanduleak -69\u00b0 202 was about one-tenth as luminous as the average observed type II supernova, which is associated with the denser makeup of the star. Because blue supergiant supernovae are not as bright as those generated by red supergiants, we cannot see them in as large a volume. We would thus not expect to see as many of them, and so they might not be as rare or unusual as previously thought.<br><br>https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A</p>",

                "answer": "<p>You don<sq>t need a supernova to trigger star formation. Really, the ISM is unstable to cooling & collapse, and its own turbulence is enough to cause star formation. Supernovae can contribute to turbulence, but the gravitational instabilities can drive turbulence too. Besides, if you needed supernovae to form stars, where do the first stars come from?<br><br>What happens is that in the ISM, the cooling rate increases with increasing density. The cooling comes from particles smashing into each other and converting their kinetic energy into radiation, which is fired out of the galaxy. A denser gas has more collisions, so it cools faster.<br><br>This is an unstable situation. If you have a patch of gas that just happens to get a little bit denser than the gas around it, then it will start to cool a bit faster than the gas around it. The cooler gas has less pressure, which means it<sq>s less supported against its own gravity, which makes it collapse further. Then makes it denser, which makes it cool faster, which makes it collapse faster, and so on.<br><br>The result is that any patch of gas will just collapse and fragment until it forms stars. This is only slowed down by processes that heat the gas, or stir it up so that denser bits get swept away before they have a chance to cool and collapse. Heating from stellar radiation, and stirring by supernovae & winds helps to stop all the gas from suddenly turning into stars. This is called <dq>feedback<dq>. And this is actually the main role of stars in star formation - they *slow down* the formation of stars by heating & stirring up the gas before it can collapse. There is a bit of a double edged sword there, in that turbulence can both create *and* destroy the dense regions that collapse into stars. But supernovae seem to play a bigger role in preventing star formation than triggering it.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>No, the strong force prevents the proton from being ripped apart. Although the strong force is often described as the force that binds the nucleus of an atom together in spite of its positive charge repelling its constituent protons, that<sq>s just a residual effect of the strong force. The strong force itself binds quarks together, and can never be broken (except in cases where you give so much energy to the system that it just creates new quarks, but these quarks are also bound into particle states). To understand why, let<sq>s consider charge.<br><br>Like the electromagnetic force, which has charges (+ and -), the strong force also has charges. But it<sq>s a little more complicated, because there are three (or six depending on how you look at it). For example, in EM you have a + charge. The opposite of a + charge isn<sq>t an anti+ charge it<sq>s a - charge. Well, in the strong force, you have three charges and their anti-charges. The quarks that make up a proton have to be one of each charge or one of each anti-charge. For intuition, it<sq>s called the colour charge. So your uud state can be rgb. Or gbr or bgr etc. Or anti red, anti green, anti blue. But together they must be <sq>colourless<sq>. Or you can think <sq>white<sq>. RGB makes white. Or anti-R anti-G anti-B makes white.<br><br>There are a number of rules when it comes to forces, and for particles one of the rules is that **no coloured objects can exist**. So if you<sq>re made of quarks, your quark colours sum to white (or colourless, whichever term you like better). If you<sq>re not made of quarks, like electrons, you<sq>re already colourless. If you try and pull quarks apart so that you<sq>ve isolated a coloured quark, you run into problems. Unlike the EM and gravitational forces, the strong force does not get weaker with distance. In fact, it *increases strength* with distance. So you encounter more resistance as you try and separate this quark. To overcome that, you invest more energy into pulling it apart. You pull it farther, reach more resistance, put in more energy, and *snap*. Before you can isolate the quark from the particle, you<sq>ve put in so much energy that thanks to E=mc^2 , that energy has become matter - new quarks. Now the quark you were pulling on can move away from its original particle, because it<sq>s got other quarks associated with it in a new particle, and you<sq>re just pulling on that particle!<br><br>So the geometry of spacetime around the black hole can appear to stretch the proton, and it will experience some tidal force (though not much due to its size) across its diameter, but it is physically impossible for any tidal force of any size, or any force anywhere, to pull some of the quarks out of the proton and leave behind the remaining quarks.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>To add to what /u/CyberPlatypus said<colon><br><br>1) Yes, moons orbiting at a smaller radius (closer to the planet) will travel faster.<br><br>2) Bigger moons will have more influence, other things being equal, but [tidal forces](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Forces) drop off as the cube of distance, so it<sq>s possible/likely that a small moon close to the planet can have more tidal influence than a big one farther away.<br><br>3/4) Yes, unless you get some weird arrangement where a moon<sq>s position is also locked with respect to the sun, but I don<sq>t think that happens and it doesn<sq>t sound stable.<br><br>5) On Earth, the phenomenon where the moon almost exactly covers up the sun is actually an incredible coincidence. The moon is about 400 times smaller than the sun, but also 400 times closer, so they appear the same size in the sky, but there<sq>s no reason this has to be. The odds are also helped on Earth because the moon<sq>s orbit is close to being in the same plane as the Earth<sq>s orbit around the sun. This makes alignments more likely/frequent. With many moons, eclipses might happen, but some might look more like a small object passing in front of the sun without covering all of it, or a big thing covering more than the entire disk of the sun. Also, you didn<sq>t ask, but the word for this alignment is [<dq>syzygy<dq>](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_\\(astronomy\\)), which is also a great play in Scrabble.<br><br>6) There<sq>s a limit to how close a moon could orbit to a planet (or planet to a star) without breaking up, called the [Roche Limit](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit).  For the Earth/moon system this is ~9500 km, which is much closer than where the moon actually is. If the moon were the same physical size, but moved to a 9500 km orbit, it would cover about 20 degrees in the sky, or about a quarter of the way from the horizon to the zenith. That kind of looks like your picture, but I<sq>m not sure you could pack several moons so close like that.<br><br>7) This is a complicated question, and something that people think about especially with exoplanets. They<sq>ve discovered a bunch of systems where, unlike our solar system, the planets don<sq>t orbit in the same plane, or the orbits don<sq>t match up with the spin of the star. So having moons on crazy inclined or eccentric orbits isn<sq>t impossible, but if you saw that you would conclude that some weird dynamical thing probably happened sometime recently (in geological time) like a big collision or a close pass with another planet or something else to get the moons all stirred up. Over time the tides that the moons exert on each other will tend to make them more regular, and they actually will get into resonances where one moon will made 2 orbits for every 1 on another. This is the case for the[ inner 3 moons of Jupiter](https<colon>//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Galilean_moon_Laplace_resonance_animation.gif), which are in a 1<colon>2<colon>4 resonance.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>A lot of this is just general orbital mechanics, and can apply not just to moons, but also artificial satellites / spaceships / solar systems. Also, moons aren<sq>t just *huuuge*, planet-sized rocks, but also more modest, country-sized ones, or even just a neat little mountain-sized one. I mention this because they usually get overlooked, and the answer to a couple of your question is actually <dq>yes, like it happends with these little rocks in our solar system<dq><br><br>> 1) If a planet has multiple moons, would they all move at the same speed or at different speeds?<br><br>An orbit of an object, and the speed at which it is orbiting, are intrinsically linked. The international space station orbits earth once every 2.5 hours, 400 km above the surface. Geostationary satellites take one day for an orbit, at ~35 thousand km. The moon, around 400 thousand km away, takes about a month. So the further away something is, the slower it is. This has to be that way, because if you<sq>re in a stable orbit, and you accelerate, you will end up in a different orbit. So the *size* of and *speed* in an orbit are just two sides of the same coin.<br><br>This is true for everything, so you can see [the same thing with planets](http<colon>//a.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/z2cmsbk/large) orbiting the sun. Wiki also [a nice graph for artificial earth satellites](https<colon>//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Comparison_satellite_navigation_orbits.svg/2000px-Comparison_satellite_navigation_orbits.svg.png) that<sq>s a bit harder to read. Also notice how the axis showing distance (horizontal) are linear, and the time/speed (vertical) is exponential. So if you plot this on a graph like the one with the planets, you get the same kind of curve.<br><br>Now, there are some freaky <dq>exceptions<dq>, like two of saturns moons that are basically in the same orbit (the differences is only 50 km, which is nothing compared to the distance to Saturn itelf, ~150 thousand km). They can [switch places from time to time](https<colon>//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/File-Epimetheus-Janus_Orbit.png). Such a configuration is highly unlikely, but it<sq>s *possible*. There are many possible freaky configurations like this, any single one of which is very unlikely, but unlikely things happen all the time. <br><br>> 2) If the moons are different sizes, would bigger moons have a bigger influence on the tides? <br><br>Yes, but what<sq>s just as / even more important is how *close* they are. Any effects will be the result of a combination of all those factors.<br><br>> 3) Sometimes we see the moon during the day here on earth. If there are multiple moons, would it be possible to see multiple moons during the day? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>> 4) At night, could there be multiple moons visible in the sky in different moon-phases? <br><br>Yes, but only if they are far enough apart as seen from the surface of the planet. So if you have two moons in the sky which are close together, they would have a very similar looking phase. For moons with orbits roughly on the equator of the planet, you could see a moon in the east and one in the west in almost opposite phases, while a third one above your head is in a full phase. So yes to different phases, but they have to be far enough apart for it to be noticably different.<br><br>> 5) Would there be more solar eclipses if there are multiple moons?<br><br>Yes and no. The position of the moon has to line up with the orbital plain of the planet around the sun to make an eclipse possible. And the moons have to be quite big in the sky to make the eclipse visible. So in general, yes, more eclipses, but there is still *huuge* variability which depends on the exact properties of the orbits. For example, earth could have an eclipse *every single month* if the orbital plain of the moon would line up with the plain of earths orbit around the sun. But because it doesn<sq>t, it can only happen tow or three times a year.<br><br>> 6) Could moons be as big as the picture indicates? <br><br>Probably not. There is this thing called the Roche Limit which describles the minimum distance of two objects depending on their mass/size/density. In short, if a moon gets to close, the tidal forces will [*rip it apart*](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/aiKv1MR.jpg). You can think of it along the lines of orbital speeds discussed earlier. The side that is closer to the planet would need to go faster to stay in the same orbit, but because it can<sq>t it<sq>s pulled towards the planet, while the far side of the moon would need to slow down to not escape. This is negligable when an object is very small, or when it<sq>s far away, but put a big moon too close to a planet, and it<sq>s own gravity won<sq>t be strong enough to counter the forces tearing it apart.<br><br>> ... or would they all appear roughly the same size as our earth-moon? <br><br>This can varay widely. How big a moon appears is, again, both dependant on it<sq>s own size *and* the distance. Earths moon is actually pretty big. There could be moons that appear larger; If the planet your standing on isn<sq>t Earth, but a much less massive one like Mars, the moons could be even bigger (because the Roche Limit is lower). But *generally speaking*, earths moon is pretty big and close, so most moons would appear smaller than it. Freaky configurations with large objects in the sky are possible, but might callange your perception of <dq>the planet vs. it<sq>s moons<dq>, or you might be the one standing on a moon, etc.<br><br>> 7) This is the last and most difficult question to explain, so bear with me. I could see multiple moons spinning around a planet, but would they all move in the same direction? I don<sq>t mean clock-wise or anti clock-wise, but, looking at the planet, would some spin top to bottom to top and others left to right to left? or maybe a diagonal? <br><br>This goes into the formation history. In principle, anything is possible here, but things need to settle into some kind of stable configuration which can exists for a few billion years. So a lot of stuff is highly unlikely. The rough guidlines look something like this<colon><br><br>- Regular Satellites. They are intrinsically linked to the formation history of their own planet, and their orbits are typically almost exactly on it<sq>s equator, just like the planets of the solar system are all roughly on the same orbital plain which corresponds to the suns equator. <br>- Irregular Satellites. They somehow got captured, and they can end up orbiting the system in pretty much any way.<br>- Large objects have a lot of infuence on all the other objects in the system. They can<sq>t be too close together, or they need to be somehow in sync with each other.<br>- Small objects can only exists where things aren<sq>t to wild, or they themselfs have the wildest of orbits, riding on a rollercoaster set up by the big masses.<br>- Deep time gets rid of everything that isn<sq>t in a *very* stable configuration.<br><br>All of this together gives you someting like our solar system. Earth has a moon that is way to big, probably from a collision with a mars sized object. Now we have one cool moon, and nothing else. The gas giants have huge regular moons, [some of which are in a peculiar configuration](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File<colon>Galilean_moon_Laplace_resonance_animation.gif), but there is also a lot of small irregular stuff floating around. The exception is Neptune, who only has a few small, closeby regular moons left, probably the result of capturing a big, irregular, pluto-sized moon which messed everything up that was there before.<br><br>The general theme here is that freaky stuff can happen, but they become more and more unlikely the bigger the objects involved become. <br><br>**TL;DR**<colon> ***Yes!*** When it comes to orbital mechanics, most answers to <dq>can [X] happen<dq> are either <dq>it happends all the time, there are a dozend examples in our solar system<dq> or <dq>this is unlikely, *and I wan<sq>t to stress how extremely freaky the circumstances must be for such an arrangement to manifest itelf*, but it probably happend somewhere in the universe<dq><br><br>Edit<colon> I took so long that the thread already filled up with answers.

                "answer": "<p>Well, it<sq>s a little but of both. Kind of. The most abundant element in the universe, by far, is hydrogen, and because of that, the active regions of space that form stars will always be comprised of great masses of H, with a little bit of He and trace other elements thrown in from previous stellar events. As mass collects through gravitational forces, it falls into a rotating disk (the most stable form) with a proto star at the center. When/if this star has enough mass to start fusion for the elements it is mainly comprised of (again, always hydrogen), the gravitational pressure will be enough to kickstart the fusion process and ignite the stellar core.<br><br>But let<sq>s say we<sq>ve got a decently rare (impossible) star where the nebula it formed from was entirely comprised of iron. This iron, like before, would collect into a disk and gravitationally compress into a proto star. However, iron is a very unique and very interesting element- it is extremely stable, and cannot effectively undergo fusion for a net gain of energy. In fact, all elements beyond iron share this trait, which is why elements heavier than iron are so rare in the universe. So, our iron mass would instead compress into itself until it reached it<sq>s limit, known as degenerate pressure. Electrons cannot occupy the same space as other electrons, and so when gravitational pressure is extremely intense, the individual elements and electrons are forced into the last possible space they can occupy- this is degenerate pressure.<br><br>But let<sq>s say we<sq>ve got a lot of iron. And I mean a lot. A solar masses worth, all pressing down in a ball tight enough to choke the individual subatomic particles into their tightest possible positions. Well, guess what? Gravity wins, and the electrons and protons across the star suddenly collapse into one another in a matter of seconds- this creates a neutron star. This mass is so compact, that were a small piece of this mass to collide with the earth. It would fly into the ground like liquid and shoot straight past the core before slowing and eventually stopping at rest in the Earth<sq>s core. Nevermind any other effects that could have. At this point, our neutron star is about the size of Manhattan. Once again, it holds against gravity via degenerate pressure, but this time with neutrons. This is getting pretty tense.<br><br>But, let<sq>s now go even further beyond. Say we have 100 solar masses of iron, and it just collapsed into a neutron star because of the intense gravitational pressure. The degeneracy pressure of the neutrons isn<sq>t powerful enough this time, and gravity wins- for the last time. The mass never stops collapsing- this is what we call a black hole. Everything becomes a single point in space, with effectively infinite density- don<sq>t touch. In fact, don<sq>t even get close, because you won<sq>t ever be able to escape, not after you pass the event horizon. This is generally what we refer to when discussing the size of a black hole, since the event horizon is the surface at which we can no longer observe what happens inside the black hole.

A nebula<sq>s density is generally somewhere around 100-10,000 particles per cubic centimeter. Let<sq>s ignore our oxygen requirement for the moment, as it is probably much less dense than our *water* requirement. <br><br>The adult human needs somewhere between 2-3 liters of water, per day. The esophagus varies in width, but maximum is about 50mm. Its not quite round, but lets estimate the area of a cross section of that esophagus by assuming it is, so pi*(50mm / 2) ^2 ~= 2000mm^2. Now we can calculate the volume per day for a given flow rate.<br><br>Let<sq>s say you<sq>re going fast. Very fast. Very, *very* fast. As fast as any man-made object has ever gone. 17 km/s fast. If you<sq>re going that fast, which is the speed of Voyager I, by the way, and your mouth was wide open, and there was an unimpeded flow directly into your esophagus, you could <dq>swallow<dq> 34 cubic meters per second. Which is quite a lot, really. 2.938 x 10^6 cubic meters per day, even. <br><br>So if you spent the whole day with your mouth wide open, sucking up space stuff, and you were flying through a particularly dense part of the nebula, you could consume 2.938 x 10^12 molecules!  Damn, that<sq>s a lot of molecules! <br><br>Or, well, erm.. Not really. Its actually less than 1 mol. What<sq>s a mol? Well, its 6.022 x 10^23 molecules. It doesn<sq>t matter what kind of molecule, if you<sq>ve got a mol of it there are 6.022 x 10^23 molecules.<br><br>So, assuming all of these molecules you were consuming were water molecules, you<sq>d have swallowed 4.9 x 10^-8 mol of water, or 0.88 nanoliters. You wouldn<sq>t have consumed even a millionth of the amount of water you need. <br><br>While a very cool idea, if you want to soar amongst the molecular clouds  please bring a supply of food, air,. and water.<br><br>Edit<colon> As an excercise, lets figure out how fast you *would* need to be going to swallow enough water. Working backwards, we know we need 2L of water per day, or 111 mol/day or 6.68 \u00d7 10^25 molecules/day, or 6.68 \u00d7 10^15 cubic meters/day of especially dense nebular gas. To consume that much, you<sq>d need to be travelling 3.87 x 10^10 km/s! Whoa there, cowboy, you<sq>re travelling 130,000 times the speed of light! You<sq>re now no longer part of the Baryonic universe and probably not dependent on water at all. </p>",

You say you have a ku band dish, so I assume you have a ku band LNB in order for the reception system to work. If you don<sq>t a PLL controlled one costs about $5 on ebay. <br><br>You can take the intermediate frequency (IF) output from the satellite LNB and connect it with RG6 coxial cable directly to a $10 rtlsdr radio receiver that covers the entire 24-1700 MHz range (R820T/RTL2832U). This is good enough to capture 2.8 MHz of the IF from the satellite LNB. But in order to power the satellite dish LNB you need a coaxial power injector ($10) and a decent ~2amp ~16-18v power supply. Hooked all together it looks something like<colon> http<colon>//erewhon.superkuh.com/powerinjection.jpg<br><br>Then make a cross on your satellite dish with aluminum tape. Use the reflections from this cross to point your dish at the sun so that the reflected <dq>X<dq> is centered on the satellite dish LNB; see<colon> http<colon>//erewhon.superkuh.com/light-cross-feed.jpg . Now hook up the rtlsdr via USB to your computer and observe the thermal radio emission from the sun.<br><br>See /r/rtlsdr for more information on the cheap USB receivers. Because these receivers work for software defined radio all your signal processing can be done for free. The usual tools are found within GNU Radio but you can get by if you<sq>re just fooling around by using less complex software like SDR#.<br><br>So, to review, you additionally need<colon><br><br>1. Low noise downconversion block (LNB). This is the thing stuck at the focal point of the dish. (~$0-$10)<br>2. RG6 coaxial cable, coaxial cable F connectors and tools (maybe) (~$10)<br>3. A coaxial power injector and an 18v power supply hooked up to RG6 coaxial cable. (~$20)<br>3. rtlsdr radio receiver usb dongle ($10)<br>4. A computer with GNU Radio or similar rtlsdr supporting programs installed on it. ($?)<br><br>After you<sq>ve accomplished this you can use the same cheap hardware with other antenna, and potentially filters, to observe weaker and more interesting targets. And unlike the SETI League<sq>s Little-Bitty Telescope these rtlsdr receivers allow you do do spectroscopy as fine as a few Hz in addition to total power. <br><br>Unfortunately the sun at 10 GHz is not exactly an interesting spectral target. It is almost entirely dominated by thermal emission instead of coherent emission. So looking at the spectrum will not be very interesting. Instead though if you chart the total power over days it is very likely you<sq>ll be able to see increases due to flaring or other events.<br><br>But... if your group ever gets another similar dish you can try something like the MIT Haystack [Very Small Radio Telescope](http<colon>//www.haystack.edu/edu/undergrad/VSRT/index.html) interferometer.

Even within observational astronomy there<sq>s a wide variety of possible tracks-- most people by default think of observational astronomy as being optical astronomy, but radio astronomy is also a large field, and then there<sq>s high-energy (Gamma and X-rays, and to some extent UV) and the whole range of infrared/submillimeter. Naturally, all of these have their unique advantages and features and challenges.<br><br>The life of an academic observational astronomer working in the optical regime involves a lot of trips to observatories for a night or often multiple nights of observing, and then months of reducing and analyzing the data. You certainly get to work with telescopes, though of course the majority of time is spent in your office working on the data.<br><br>If you want to pursue this course, then of course take any astronomy classes you can get your hands on at college, and **make a serious effort to familiarize yourself with observing**. This can take many forms-- TA<sq>ing or proctoring lower-level observational classes, volunteering at public nights at your school<sq>s observatory, and doing your own observing with a backyard telescope. That last one will actually teach you a very great deal about observing and how telescopes work. If you can get yourself a decent camera, try some astrophotography, it will help to introduce you to a lot of aspects of observing. Your area probably has an amateur astronomy group, meet up with them and get some advice.<br><br>Planetary astronomy is certainly a thing-- do you mean working on Solar System objects or on extrasolar planets? Both tend to emphasize the optical and infrared. Solar System planetary astronomy tends to include a lot of more general planetary science-- geophysics, climatology, and chemistry. If you<sq>re looking to study Solar System objects, then having some background in those fields will be helpful.<br><br>I don<sq>t know where you<sq>re going to undergrad, but for grad schools, some of the places in the US that emphasize observational astronomy are the following (this is by no means a complete list, just the stuff that jumps to mind)<colon><br><br>* University of Arizona -- home of the Steward Obsevatory, which includes many large telescopes<br><br>* University of Hawaii -- Access to most of the amazing telescopes up on Mauna Kea, strong observational program<br><br>* Ohio State -- Renowned as a high-quality and very cohesive department with strengths in optical and infrared observational astronomy<br><br>* University of California system -- Prestigious schools with considerable access to large telescope facilities<br><br>* University of Virginia -- located next door to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, this is the best place to go if you want to do observational radio astronomy. <br><br>* University of Colorado at Boulder -- one of the premier places to study planetary astronomy<br><br>and of course the usual suspects like Columbia and Harvard. </p>",

Earth is made up of the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. The important part is that the crust rest on top the mantle. The mantle is made up of liquid magma. This makes it so that the crust on top can move over -- or to give imaginary-- float on top of it. So, as we know, the earths crust is split up into different movable sections that float on top of the mantle. This is (in the most basic of terms) what causes plate tectonics on earth.<br><br>Now for Mars. Mars has it<sq>s crust, and it<sq>s mantle as well. However, on mars the mantle has solidified.

                "answer": "<p>Hello, and welcome to the life of an astronomer! I<sq>m going to give you a broad overview of your scope and what you can expect to do with it, as well as some other tips. I<sq>ll try and **bold** anything you ought to check wikipedia etc for more information when you have the opportunity.<br><br>For starters, congrats on your **Maksutov-Cassegrain** on a single fork **altitude-azimuth** mount. Fork mounts are common with **catadiaoptric** **GOTO** telescopes as they are quick and easy to set up, and leave the brunt of the tracking to the onboard computer. To set it up, the telescope<sq>s onboard computer will lead you through an alignment process wherein it will ask you to align the telescope to a few stars in order to help it determine the telescope<sq>s orientation. You<sq>ll then be able to tell the scope what you want to see, and it will track it for you. If you want better, more precise tracking, use a *wedge* to shift the telescope into **equatorial** mode. <br><br>As you can observe if you ever look at **star trails**, all stars revolve around Polaris in the sky. An equatorial telescope allows you to track along these arcs. Once you set the telescope in the right arc (**declination**), and move it to the right position along that arc (**right ascension**), all you have to do is move the telescope along the arc at the same rate as the stars, keeping what ever object you<sq>re looking at in view. <br><br>Of course, you<sq>re probably curious to know what you can look at. For starters, lets assess your equipment. You<sq>ve got a 102 mm **aperture**, with a 1325mm **focal length**. Aperture is the diameter of your telescope<sq>s *primary mirror* and affects how much light the telescope gathers. The focal length is useful for determining magnification. You should have a 25mm eyepiece. To find the magnification yielded by each divide the focal length of the telescope by the focal length of the eyepiece. 1325/25 = 53x. I would consider investing in either a **Barlow lens** to double your magnification, or a 10mm eyepiece, but not both. A 10mm would give you 133x, and with a Barlow you<sq>d also get 106x and 266x magnifications but the 266x exceeds the practical limiting magnification of your telescope. In fact, I would not consider going much beyond 200x, which could be accomplished with a 7mm eyepiece, or a 15mm eyepiece with a 2x Barlow. Without the Barlow the 15mm would also yield a 88x magnification. <br><br>With that in mind, you should be able to see the rings of Saturn, the bands of Jupiter (albeit very small), the **Gallilean moons**, and the surface of the Moon. Bright Messier objects like the **Pleiades** and the **Orion Nebula** should also be visible. How many **Deep Space Objects** are available to you largely depends on your viewing location. A general rule of thumb I exercise with scopes of this size is if you can<sq>t see our own galaxy (the **Milky Way**), don<sq>t expect to see many others. Still, if you can find a good dark site to observe from, the **Messier Catalog** is a great place to start, and will really refine your **starhopping** skills.<br><br><br><br>If you<sq>re looking for a sky map program, I highly recommend **Stellarium**. There are some other, paid, solutions which offer a few extra features, like **Starry Night**, but I find Stellarium good enough for most purposes. <br><br>Also, there are two excellent publications, **Sky & Telescope** and **Astronomy Magazine** which both provide very useful information, give a summary of upcoming astronomical events, tips and tricks, etc. and are well worth a subscription to. <br><br>Redditor /u/eyesontheskydotcom provides a good weekly overview of the night sky at his website, http<colon>//eyesonthesky.com</p>",

                "answer": "<p>It totally depends on the strength of the aurora and the light pollution in your area. If you live in or around LA you will probably never see the lights; it<sq>s far south, and there<sq>s just too much light pollution. That being said, there have been extreme solar flares in the past that have created auroras that were visible in Hawaii and Cuba. To get away from light pollution you typically have to go about 100km (60mi) away from civilization. If you meet this criteria you could probably see the aurora in some of the northern states or possibly as far south as northern California if it is a particularly active aurora. <br><br>Where I live, in Edmonton (53\u00b0N) I can see the northern lights from my bedroom window basically any time they are occurring. I do live on the edge of the city though. If they are strong, they can still be seen faintly from downtown. The northern lights can be seen here even in the summer if it is an active solar year, although it is tricky because it doesnt get dark until around 11pm, and even after that it never gets totally dark on the north side of the horizon. <br><br>Typically they don<sq>t look like much and they are easy to mistake for clouds, but if you are looking for them you can tell the difference. They usually look like thin, whispy clouds, but if you look closely you can see them moving and flickering, they actually move surprisingly fast. If you go outside away from streetlights, you can see the color in them. Usually though they are not that bright and the only color you see is green. The vivid pictures you see are deceptive, because it<sq>s easy to make them look way cooler with a good camera. All you have to do is take a picture with a long exposure, anywhere from 2-16 seconds, and the camera will pick up colors that you can<sq>t even see with your own eyes. I have taken many good pictures of the lights when most of the time I could barely see them with my own eyes. I will post some below. <br><br>If you want to really see good lights, you have to take a trip to Canada<sq>s north...or go to Alaska if you don<sq>t like Canada. Plan a trip during a solar maximum, the next one will probably be around 2024/2025, now is not a great time to see them and we are heading towards the solar minimum. If you do come to Canada to see the aurora, I would recommend going to Yellowknife or Whitehorse (60-63\u00b0N). Both those cities are just below the Arctic circle and are pretty much the northernmost point of civilization, but they are still big enough that you can still expect mostly the same accomodations you would see at home. <br><br>There are still a few small towns and villages farther north, from which you could see pretty impressive northern lights, but the weather can be pretty brutal there, too cold even for most Canadians, hence why there are only 3 cities in Canada<sq>s territories with a combined population of less than 60,000. Also the languages and culture are mostly native/Inuit, so it would probably be a fairly challenging adventure, especially if you aren<sq>t experienced with the cold. I used to live in the north. I was born there, and it<sq>s beautiful, but holy crap the weather sucks. <br><br>Here<sq>s some of my aurora pictures. Most of these were visible, but not so bright that you would notice it right away.

In number 8, the grass shows how long the exposure was and how much light the camera had to collect.

Storms certainly existed prior to that time, but there<sq>s plenty of confusion about how long the storm we know has been around. Early on, perhaps due to the quality of telescopes at the time, observations of a large spot on Jupiter were, well... spotty. Ok, they were sporadic. [A large spot would be tracked for a year or two, then disappear for five years, appear, and disappear again.](http<colon>//articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/MNRAS/0059//0000575.000.html) Then starting after 1713, there<sq>s over 100 years of nobody mentioning this amazingly large spot on Jupiter. As telescopes improved, one might think records of Jupiter<sq>s spots, especially a Great one, would become more consistent, but instead, nobody recorded much of anything about them for over a century- observations are nearly continuous only since the current Great Red Spot was seen in 1831. So there<sq>s a chance a long-lived storm was observed in the 1600s, it faded in the early 1700s, and a new storm formed in the 1800s, with the latter surviving until today. Unless some trove of 200-year-old astronomical observations are uncovered, we<sq>re left without a clear answer for just how old the storm we know might be. <br><br>Storms come and go on other gas giants over various timescales, so it<sq>s reasonable to expect it to happen on Jupiter too. The Great Dark Spot on Neptune, for example, existed for an unknown length of time before Voyager 2 visited in 1989, then faded from view and was succeeded by a large storm in the northern hemisphere at some point before Hubble was pointed that direction in 1995. That would be quite a coincidence, so it may simply suggest that Neptune<sq>s storms are pretty short-lived. On Saturn, [storms flare up every 30 Earth years or so](http<colon>//www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassini20130903.html). This just happens to equal 1 Saturnian year, so there are some seasonal factors at play there. We only know that last piece of information because the Cassini spacecraft has been orbiting Saturn for over a decade- we need long periods of up-close study to really uncover what drives changes on giant planets.</p>",

Just like most objects in the solar system are roughly on the same plane as the suns equator, most moons and rings of the gas giants are on the equator of their respective planets. This comes from their formation history; the major moons are believed to have formed together with the planets, similar to how the planets have formed together alongside the sun itself. If the moon orbits are to their planets equator what the planet orbits are to the suns equator, you<sq>re right that all those planes *should* roughly correspond to each other. But only <dq>by accident<dq>, because what is more important is that the moons and rings are on the equatorial plane of it<sq>s planet, and the sun doesn<sq>t really have a direct infuence on that.<br><br>So, when you actually look at all the moons, you find that many of them won<sq>t be close to the ecliptic, and even if they are (like Jupiters moons), they<sq>re still closer to the planets equator. You could say that the moons *should* be roughly on the ecliptic, but because of all the exceptions, it just doesn<sq>t really happen.<br><br>The most basic exceptions are the [irregular moons](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_moon), of which there are a lot. Most of them are very small, and are believed to be captured objects, instead of objects that formed in the orbit of a planet. They can enter the system from all directions, so it<sq>s extremely unlikely that they just happend to end up on a nice, almost circular orbit that lies on the planets equatorial plane, like the regular satellites. Some <dq>true<dq> moons might have irregular orbits because something went wrong since their formation, like large objects entering the system and messing things up.<br><br>A more complicated one is the long term gravitational interaction between all the big objects in the solar system. I don<sq>t know the details on this, and this is a hot issue in the field right now. But afai can tell the most plausable model of the formation of the solar system right now involves the gas giants forming closer to the sun, but the system wasn<sq>t stable in the long term, and the gravitational interactions of everything [kind of blasted things apart](https<colon>//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Lhborbits.png), pushing the gas giants much further out. This could also have thrown Uranus off from the ecliptic, but slowly, it got dragged back in line by the other planets. But this process also altered the axis of the whole Uranus system and putting it on it<sq>s side, including the regular satelites which still orbit on it<sq>s equator. There are lot<sq>s of possibilities here, solar system formation is still not really understood. But the point is, it<sq>s possible to change the tilt of the gas giants through long term gravitational interactions in the entire solar system if things are somehow not, let<sq>s call it, <dq>well balanced<dq>. And the same mechanisms act on their moons, keeping them on the respective equatorial plane.<br><br>Another major exception is Earths moon. Unlike most major satellites, it is closer to the ecliptic than to it<sq>s panets equator. Like you said, this discrepancy can be explained with a collision early in earths history.<br><br>I guess it<sq>s best to adhere to the hierarchy and just think of all objects in relation to their parent object, eg the thing they are gravitationally bound to. There are yet more complicated things like trojan asteroids, which have to do with the gravity of a planet and the sun at the same time, but for moons it usually doesn<sq>t make sense to think of them in terms of their relation to the sun/ecliptic. They are either regular satellites, in which case they have a relation to their planets axis/equator, or they are irregular, and thus have no real relation to either the equator or the ecliptic. </p>",

Back when radio transmission technology was becoming popular, most transmissions were sent via long-wave radio which, when powerful enough, could make it out of the Earth<sq>s ionosphere and out in to space. Although not much power escaped, an advanced civilization could have, in principle, heard us. Today, we<sq>ve realized how wasteful that is, so we<sq>ve become better at directionalizing our transmissions - we point our satellites at specific locations, we hardly broadcast any long-wave transmissions in to space, etc. I haven<sq>t done the calculations, but I predict that we<sq>re only a little more <dq>radio-loud<dq>, or perhaps we<sq>re even quieter, than we were say 50 years ago.<br><br>Another problem is that actually sending signals in to space with the purpose of being heard by ET is hard to do. Firstly, it<sq>s expensive. The transmitter on the [Arecibo Telescope](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory), for example, which has been used by SETI for transmitting signals for ET to hear, has a maximum output power of about 150 kW. That<sq>s about the same as 25 or 50 households (according to wolframalpha) of power. Energy isn<sq>t free, unfortunately. Secondly, it<sq>s hard to reserve a telescope to actually do the transmitting. Think about it, if you were in charge of allocating telescope time, would you want to give money to the people who could make potentially world-changing astronomical discoveries or to the people who just want to turn the telescope on for a few hours. (Of course, I would say that finding ET would be more world-changing than any other astronomical discovery, but it<sq>s hard to convince that to the people in charge of $$$). Finally, it<sq>s easier to listen than it is to yell. SETI knows this which is why most of their money goes in to listening for ET instead of transmitting. The downside to this, though, is what if all of the other civilizations in the Galaxy are doing the same? If everyone is listening but no one is yelling, then what is there to listen for?<br><br>Those are my thoughts on the situation.<br><br>Source<colon> I<sq>m a radio astronomer, I<sq>ve worked on some SETI projects at Arecibo, and I just taught a lecture on this topic today <colon>)</p>",

Quoting from Wikipedia<colon> <dq>Kepler<sq>s laws of planetary motion allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun<dq>. Basically, using the math which Kepler set forth, and defining the distance between the Earth and the Sun as <dq>1 AU<dq>, you could calculate the relative distances between the other planets and the Sun in terms of AU. You just didn<sq>t know what 1 AU was.<br><br>Scottish mathematician [James Gregory](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gregory_\\(mathematician\\)) described in 1663 [a method for using the transit of Venus to determine through parallax the value of 1 AU](http<colon>//www.exploratorium.edu/venus/question4.html). This is often credited to [Edmond Halley](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley), of Halley<sq>s Comet fame, in 1716; but as near as I can tell, Halley was advocating Gregory<sq>s approach. Basically, you<sq>d have two observers separated by some distance record the times of certain critical events during the transit. The differences in their measurements could be used to geometrically determine the value of 1 AU, and thus allowing the translation of the relative distances which had been established via Kepler into other units (e.g. miles).<br><br>It should be noted that this technique also works with transits of Mercury. If I had to guess why Venus got all the attention, I<sq>d say that it<sq>s because Venus is bigger and closer, and you might not need as precise equipment to make measurements of its transit. There is quite a lot I<sq>m skipping over there, so I encourage you to read up on the [Transit of Venus](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus) for more detail.<br><br>So, if 1 AU is the distance between the Earth and the Sun, that gives us a baseline for parallax observations. If you take measurements 6 months apart, when the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun, your virtual triangle has a base of 2 AU. From there, the effectiveness of [stellar parallax](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax) as a means of distance calculation depends in large part on the sensitivity and accuracy of the equipment used. The first star whose distance was determined through this method was [61 Cygni](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_Cygni). There are also ways of [using the Sun<sq>s motion over the years or decades](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax#Other_baselines) as a much longer baseline for parallax measurements. The unit <dq>parsec<dq> is defined as a <dq>*par*allax of one arc *sec*ond<dq>, and is equivalent to 3.26 light years. This method only works for relatively nearby objects, being within ~1000 parsecs. That<sq>s nowhere near enough to measure distance to another galaxy<colon> even the [Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major_Dwarf_Galaxy), our closest galactic neighbor as far as I<sq>m aware, is around 13,000 parsecs away.  It *is*, however, enough to directly measure the distance to the Orion Nebula, at only ~450 parsecs.  Interesting (I think) side note<colon> If the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is 13,000 parsecs away, and the [Milky Way](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) is 80,000 parsecs wide, then there are parts of another galaxy which are closer to us than parts of our own galaxy.<br><br>This is not the only way we have of determining interstellar distances. Certain types of variable stars provide a second means, though I<sq>m only going to talk about [Cepheid variables](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable_stars). Variable stars in general pulse at regular or irregular intervals. The Sun is a variable star. In Cepheid variables, [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt) discovered a relationship between their luminosity and the period of their pulse. If we measure the time from peak brightness to peak brightness on a Cepheid, we know how luminous it is and from that we can work out its distance. Knowing the luminosity means we know whether the Cepheid is dim and close, or bright and far away. It was a [Cepheid variable](http<colon>//www.space.com/11761-historic-star-variable-hubble-telescope-photo-aas218.html) which allowed [Edwin Hubble](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble) to determine that the [Andromeda Galaxy](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) was a separate entity outside of the Milky Way, and not a nebula within it.<br><br>[Type Ia supernovae](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova) are a third means. This sort of supernova happens when a degenerate progenitor, such as a white dwarf, siphons off enough matter from a companion to exceed the [Chandrasekhar limit](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit) of 1.44 solar masses. In a normal star, the inward force of gravity is countered by the outward force of thermal pressure; however, in a white dwarf, the star is kept from collapse not by thermal pressure but by the force of electrons maintaining their orbits. Once a white dwarf hits the Chandrasekhar limit, gravity overcomes that force and the star undergoes a runaway reaction. The resulting light curve, which is a plot of the luminosity of the supernova over time, has a very characteristic shape and can be adjusted through some simple math to be a <dq>[standard candle](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_candle#Standard_candles)<dq>. As with Cepheids, once you<sq>ve standardized your Type Ia supernova, you know whether it<sq>s dim and close, or bright and far away.<br><br>A fourth means is through [redshift](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift). When you asked about using the <dq>color<dq> of a star to determine its distance, this is most likely what you<sq>re talking about. We point a [spectrometer](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometer) at the object in question and take a look at the light coming from it. Certain elements emit light at certain wavelengths, such as [the Balmer series of spectral emission lines for hydrogen](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_series). We can take a look at where those lines are, versus where they would be for a nearby stationary source, such as a hydrogen lamp in a lab. This actually tells us how fast the object in question is moving, either toward (blueshift) or away (redshift) from us, but for objects the size of galaxies, it relates to how far away the object is. The farther the galaxy is from us, the faster it is moving away from us. That doesn<sq>t imply that we<sq>re at the center of the universe, though<colon> it would be true no matter where in the universe we were.<br><br>There are a number of other methods, which you can learn about through to the [Cosmic Distance Ladder](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder) page on Wikipedia.<br><br>Note<colon> I copied parts of this post from [a previous post of mine](http<colon>//redd.it/229jug), where I copied parts from [a previous post of mine](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/askastronomy/comments/1m3006/very_simple_and_basic_question_how_do_astronomers/cc5ezyx).</p>",

So in an imaginary top-view map of our Milkyway, we know which areas we should not expect to see doppler shift.<br><br><br>The more interesting case of course is the directions where we do expect to see the frequency of the Hydrogen signal change due to doppler. If for instance we look <sq>forward<sq> but also a bit <sq>outward<sq> compared to our own direction of movement in the Milkyway, we will see hydrogen that is on the outside track compared to us, and therefore moving slower. So we<sq>re catching up on it, going faster, and will see it as blueshifted. I<sq>ve created a little model of such a Milky Way a while ago to show this effect<colon> [Rotation Model](http<colon>//epboven.home.xs4all.nl/HI-doppler-model.png). The yellow dot is the aproximate position of our sun, which is in orbit (clockwise) around the center of the Milkyway. The black areas seem to match the predicted zones without doppler shift.<br><br><br>So imagine you are at the yellow dot, and looking in a particular direction, in a straight line of course. In some directions, you will only see blue shifted hydrogen at varying higher frequencies, in others you will only see red shifted. There are also looking directions where you will first encounter matter that moves towards us, but at a larger distance, it<sq>s actually moving away from us, all due to the rotation of our Galaxy. It is the amount of doppler shift in the various directions that gives us a measure of how fast the different parts of our Milkyway rotate, and from that, how fast our rotation is.<br><br>I<sq>ve been lucky enough to actually get to measure this Hydrogen signal, using a fairly large radio telescope<colon> [Milky Way Scan](http<colon>//www.camras.nl/images/stories/RadioAstronomie/DT-HI-map-2009-01-02.png). The resulting image shows an intensity map of viewing direction versus frequency of the hydrogen signal. You can see that in a direction of 180 degrees (straight away from the center), indeed everything collapses to a single frequency of nearly 1420.4 MHz. You can also see that up to about 60 degrees away from the center, we see both red and blue shift, and beyond that, you will only see either positive or negative speeds, but not both at the same time - this too matches what you could predict from looking at the model. <br><br><br>I hope this somewhat anwsers your question and is low enough on maths. But this stuff is even more fun when you get to plug actual numbers into it, and really work out this speed, for instance.<br><br><br>TL;DR<colon> doppler effect, hydrogen line, radio astronomy.</p>",

They will be able to help you more immediately than some random dude on the Internet.  They will also have telescopes of their own, as well as people who own the kit you<sq>re looking at buying and can a)  show it to you, and b) know the pitfalls/quirks/down- and upsides.<br><br>2.  Are you willing to haul 75 lbs. of fairly bulky gear out with you every time you set up?  Do you have a permanent location you can set this up in?  The best telescope for you is the one that will get used the most.<br><br>3.  You say this is your first telescope.  Do you have any prior experience with astronomy, the sky, or other telescopes you may have looked through?  If not, my advice is to take a step back, visit your local astronomy club, buy a nice pair of binoculars and spend some time learning the sky.  That way, if you decide the hobby is not for you, you haven<sq>t spent so much money (you can find a good pair of binoculars, a nice learner<sq>s book like *The Stars*, *Turn Left at Orion*, or *Nightwatch*, and a planisphere for $150 or less).<br><br>If you *do* have this experience already under your belt, full speed ahead!<br><br>As for your specific choices, the OTA is good.  I have no experience with iOptron mounts, but I would be leery of putting a 20 lb. OTA on a mount with a 27 lb. capacity, especially since you need to put the finder on, then the focuser, eyepieces, etc., and all of a sudden you<sq>re at the mount<sq>s limit and it<sq>s totally shaky.  The eyepiece/filter set is fine, but I doubt you<sq>ll use most of them.  Color filters provide a marginal improvement at best for certain contrast features on planets, and are useless elsewhere.  You don<sq>t need polarizers *and* a neutral denstiy filter.  The Barlow is cheap and certainly functional, but the eyepieces included obviate the need for one, since you<sq>ll just duplicate focal lengths you already have.  Also, since the focal length on the SCT is so long, you<sq>ll want longer focal length eyepieces so you can get reasonable powers for most objects.  So forget what I said, the eyepiece kit is not fine paired with the SCT!  You<sq>d be better off getting a couple of 20-30mm eyepieces, with a 10-12.5mm class for higher power viewing of planets and the Moon to start, as well as a cheap neutral density filter.  You could find all that for less than/around $100, espeically if you look on the [Cloudy Nights classifieds](http<colon>//www.cloudynights.com/classifieds/).<br><br>~~One more~~ several more questions<colon>  is there any particular reason you want the equatorial mount?  Do you really want the GoTo functionality?  Are you particularly attached to the Cassegrain?  If you aren<sq>t, you can save a lot of money by getting one of Orion<sq>s GoTo Dobs (like, ~$1,000 kind of money).  Or ditch the GoTo and save even *more* money by getting a non-computerized Dob (you can get an 8<dq> Dob for $500 or less, easily).<br><br>And if you still want the GoTo, the tracking, and the Cassegrain (car<sq>s too small, tiny apartment, etc.), you can get a fork-mounted model from Meade or Celestron for less money, to the tune of several hundred dollars, than the GEM-mounted version.  Celestron<sq>s CPC version is even [on sale](http<colon>//www.celestron.com/astronomy/series/cpc-series-computerized-telescopes/?cat=4).  You can also give up an inch and a quarter of aperture and get the 8-inch model, saving you a lot of money and weight, while not sacrificing too much in terms of viewable objects or lost detail.<br><br>Oh, and one last question, perhaps the most important one<colon>  what do you want to do with the telescope?</p>",

                "answer": "<p>TL, DR<colon> it has to be massive enough (more than 6 times the mass of the sun). <br><br>What happens in star is that it is in hydrostatic equilibrium- the gravitational force that is trying to collapse the star is balanced by the star<sq>s own internal heat. This heat source is fusion. First, a star will combine hydrogen into helium. The net outcome of this fusion process is heat. Once the star burns hydrogen into helium, it will burn up most of the hydrogen in its core and it will shut down. (Hydrogen burning still does occur in outer envelopes, btw) since there isn<sq>t any more heat source, the core cools down and collapses. This collapsing causes it to heat up due to friction. The core then gets hella hot- hot enough to then burn helium into carbon (I believe). Some smaller stars just stop here. But larger stars, like our big mamma jamma 6 solar mass dude, is big enough to go through various types of fusion all the way up until it has a nice stockpile of iron in its core. Unfortunately for our dude, it takes more energy to fuse iron than it creates from the fusion process. So, the core shuts off and starts to collapse and actually bounces off of itself - the result is a supernova. Kaboom. The remnant of the stars core becomes either a neutron star or a black hole depending on its mass. If it is more than 3-4 solar masses, then the stars mass is so large that its escape velocity is more than the speed of light, so even light doesn<sq>t escape.

                "answer": "<p>There are two primary kinds of [supernova](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova), with different triggers to set them off.  Supernovae are primarily categorized via the [Minkowski-Zwicky supernova classification scheme](http<colon>//adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993Ap<percent>26SS.202..215D) by their spectral signature.  Type I have no hydrogen present, where Type II do.<br><br>Type I supernovae are thought to result from a runaway thermal process.  The best-known subtype of Type I is called <dq>[Type Ia](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova)<dq>, and it is one of the standard(izable) candles on the [Cosmic Distance Ladder](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder).<br><br>A Type Ia supernova involves a binary pair of stars.  The first is a [white dwarf](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) more massive than the Sun, which has burned through all its hydrogen and shed its outer layers, and is now composed of carbon and oxygen.  White dwarf stars are a different from other stars, in that they aren<sq>t undergoing fusion anymore.  A normal star doesn<sq>t collapse because the outward pressure of energy released by fusion is sufficient to overcome the inward force of gravity trying to make its mass more compact.  However, the main thing which keeps a white dwarf from collapsing is [electron degeneracy pressure](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure) - that is, the outward pressure of the electrons trying to maintain their orbits / energy levels.  Electron degeneracy pressure is a form of the more general [quantum degeneracy pressure](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_degeneracy), which is most easily understood as why solid matter is solid.  Basically, white dwarf stars are still hot, but not hot enough to fuse the carbon or oxygen at their cores.  Left to their own devices, they would shed heat over billions of years until they at last ran out of heat entirely and became a black dwarf.  But this white dwarf star has a companion...<br><br>The companion may be of any size, but is close enough that the gravity of the white dwarf is able to overcome the companion<sq>s own gravity, and the white dwarf siphons matter from the companion<sq>s surface to itself.  Once the white dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar mass (1.38 solar masses), it reignites and may supernova.  Once the white dwarf hits the [Chandrasekhar limit](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit) (1.44 solar masses), the inward pressure of gravity overcomes the outward pressure of electron degeneracy, and it necessarily will supernova, dominantly producing iron.  It<sq>s worth noting that [Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar) figured this out at the age of 19, while he was traveling from India to Britain to begin his graduate studies.<br><br>[Type II supernovae](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova) are thought to result from the collapse of the core of a very massive star.  As a star fuses, it will tend to differentiate and stratify - that is, the heavier elements will settle toward the center, pushing the lighter elements out, forming layers primarily composed of like material.  If a star is massive enough, it will have layers of hydrogen, helium, carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon, and iron.  This last one is a problem, as it is not possible for a star to reach temperatures and pressures sufficient to fuse iron.  When a star has burned through enough fuel that its iron core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, electron degeneracy pressure is no longer sufficient to withstand the inward force of gravity, and the core collapses.  The collapse is halted by neutron degeneracy pressure, and matter falling in on the core suddenly rebounds, producing a shock wave that expands outwards into a supernova.  Depending on the initial mass of the progenitor star, the supernova may produce a neutron star or a black hole - or, for especially massive progenitor stars, they may skip the supernova altogether and simply collapse directly into a black hole.</p>",

It essentially defines how close two stars can be in (angular separation, not physical) and still be able to resolve them as distinct objects.  To see the flag on the moon, you would need a telescope 200 meters in diameter.  While this is not doable currently, there is a work around.  You could use an array of smaller telescopes spaced 200 meters apart and through some optical magic combine the images from each to create an image that has the effective resolution of a single telescope of the same size.  This is called optical interferometry.  It is very difficult to achieve.  The VLT telescope in Chile is the largest optical interferometer and consists of four 8.2m telescopes.  In this configuration, it could resolve a 2m sized object on the moon, at least mathematically.  There is also the problem of the Earth<sq>s atmospheric turbulence which limits the theoretical resolution of a telescope along with how transparent the air is from night to night.  This is not something that the average amateur astronomer could do even with 8<dq> telescopes unless you had a lot of money to burn.</p>",

I was a shit student for most of my life. When I got serious about school and went back for polisci/astro, I became a top performer. I come from a middle class background where immediate job and money wasn<sq>t an issue, and tuition wasn<sq>t an issue. So my advice is based partially on the experience I<sq>ve had, and might not translate.<br><br>Let<sq>s start with job prospects. There are absolutely more jobs with a CS degree than an astro (physics) degree. An astro degree is basically a physics degree, plus a few specialised courses. The pay is also likely higher with a CS degree, although a CS friend of mine notes that entry level jobs are saturated and entry level pay isn<sq>t always exactly comfortable. But overall working your way into, and up, a CS job will be much easier than the same in astronomy.<br><br>That said, a professional astronomer can make upward of $100k/yr at a university with tenure, but that<sq>s a very difficult position to get. Patience will be required, and many postdocs. Also to be a professional astronomer you<sq>ll need to go all the way through a PhD, whereas CS jobs begin after undergrad (though you could certainly go to PhD there out of interest).<br><br>However if you decide partially down the astro route that you don<sq>t want to go all the way through, a physics degree is still good at the undergrad level because you are forced to learn some comp sci anyway, you learn most of the math that gets used in day jobs (making things like finance and accounting a much easier skill to pick up), and of course you become an excellent candidate for science outreach or similar jobs. So while the professional researcher may be difficult to attain, a good pay and a good job isn<sq>t with the degree; it<sq>s not all-or-nothing.<br><br>People will always tell you how hard it is to get a job in astro, people will always tell you how bad the job market is. In my experience, people are very quick to tell you reasons why you shouldn<sq>t take risks, and much quicker if they themselves tried and failed. I would take any and all of that advice with a grain of salt. I<sq>ve heard people who just didn<sq>t have the interest or passion for astro, who completed their degree and didn<sq>t get a job within 6 months, complain that it was not possible. They didn<sq>t advertise their lack of skill, their lack of accomplishments, or their unwillingness to learn and improve when advising others not to pursue their passion. Be careful that you<sq>re aware of the context in which advice is given. But ultimately whether the risk of not becoming a professional astronomer is worth it will be a personal choice you have to make. At the end of the day, whatever you<sq>re okay with will be the right choice, because if you try your best but are open to the possibility it may not happen, you won<sq>t ever regret trying. If you aren<sq>t open to that possibility and you don<sq>t try, you<sq>ll feel good about dodging that job market bullet. But if you<sq>re open to that possibility but get talked out of trying, it<sq>ll stay in the back of your mind for a long time. (Like I said, my advice is coloured by my experience. If I would starve without a job within ~6mo, I might be upset that I wasn<sq>t hired quickly too.)<br><br>Depending on your age and your situation, it<sq>s always worth pursuing your passion. When I started in astro, I started with a lot of interested people. Some had the interest, but not enough to carry them through the degree (it<sq>s pretty gruelling and definitely can feel like work at times). Others had enough interest to get through the degree and go work in other fields, and others still have gone on to work in astro research. But I don<sq>t know anyone from any of those groups who regret having tried. Again, depending on your personal context, it<sq>s a risk for which you<sq>ll have to decide for yourself.<br><br>It<sq>s also possible to switch around. If you<sq>re 2 years into astro and it really isn<sq>t what you thought it<sq>d be, and you<sq>re not so interested, you can switch to CS. You<sq>ll already have done some of the math requirements (calc, linear algebra) for CS, plus some general ed courses, so you won<sq>t even be starting from scratch! All it will cost is a year or two, and a year or two<sq>s tuition, but your program of entry puts you under no obligation to stay in that program. Who knows, maybe you<sq>ll even discover a different field that<sq>s neither of those two that you didn<sq>t know you cared about so much - it happens!<br><br>Finally, since you<sq>re linking U of T, I<sq>m going to rep my own undergrad institute and say if you<sq>re looking for Toronto schools don<sq>t discount York. They don<sq>t have much in the way of a science reputation, and I still don<sq>t know if that<sq>s because the school sucks at PR when the phys department does something (which it does), or if the department really did used to suck to the point where it wasn<sq>t worth talking about, but for astronomy in particular...fuck man, I lucked hard into that one. For the observatory there alone it<sq>s worth it, because you can start working in that place from day one and you learn *so much*. Research and outreach programs run every night and twice a week, respectively, the guy in charge is one of the top outreach people in astro in the country (and he<sq>ll be retiring in 5+ years so now<sq>s the chance), and there<sq>s quite a variety of research going on among the different profs. It<sq>s not a huge department, but it<sq>s very open, very friendly, and very encouraging for students who want more than the daily class routine. School reputation turns out not to be all that important unless your destination is an American Ivy League and your job will be somewhere that name recognition is more important than what<sq>s on your CV. I applied to several top schools here and in Europe for grad school, and nobody turned their nose up at me.<br><br>U of T is an excellent school, and I<sq>ve got friends who found it to be a very stimulating environment, I wouldn<sq>t try and talk you out of it and I wouldn<sq>t expect you to base that decision on something some Reddit dude says in a ranting post. But I<sq>ve seen campus observatories at like 6 schools in person, U of T included, and honestly if your goal is to really learn the science well, to become practised in it, and to be competitive when applying for grad school, you should know about York<sq>s observatory.<br><br>Ultimately as I<sq>ve said the risk of whether to go to astro is a personal choice nobody should make for you, and one you<sq>ll need to be okay with if you make, because you<sq>ll need to devote yourself 100<percent> to it if you want a chance at that coveted research job.<br><br>And finally, whether you<sq>ve already done university-level stuff, I gotta say that you get out of university what you put into it. 90<percent> of your experience will depend entirely on the level of effort, the willingness to meet new people in your new field, and the drive with which you push yourself. The exact same program running the exact same years will always graduate people who say the program is shit and people who say the program is amazing, because what the university provides for you is only the foundation for what your experience will be.

                "answer": "<p>It<sq>s due to a concept called <sq>conservation of angular momentum<sq>. The short explanation is that the Solar System began as a cloud of gas and dust, and as it collapsed to form our system, it had a spin to it. That spin was in the counterclockwise direction (as seen from above), and so the system<sq>s components inherited this spin.<br><br>An explanation like that may lead one to ask <dq>what about clouds that don<sq>t have spins?<dq> It turns out that conservation of angular momentum is going to impart a spin on any such collapsing cloud. <br><br>Think of angular momentum as some physical value which determines how a gas cloud will spin. It can be a large value, or a small value, but for now let<sq>s just assume it<sq>s never quite zero. This value is constant for that cloud. It depends on the cloud<sq>s size and rate of spin, but the rate of spin and size will change inversely to one another to keep this thing constant. So if the cloud gets smaller, as happens during collapse, the cloud must spin faster, or this value will no longer be constant.<br><br>So the initial cloud was actually spinning quite slowly, but the faster spin of the Sun (and other components) came as a result of the collapse. What<sq>s important here is that the value remain constant; the direction of spin isn<sq>t important to its value. So the cloud could easily have been spinning clockwise, but by random chance it just didn<sq>t happen to. After the cloud collapses, things are very definitely spinning in the cloud<sq>s initial direction, but much faster, so you need something catastrophic to occur to make any of the cloud<sq>s components (like planets, etc.) to rotate against this direction. Venus is a good example of this, as viewed from the top it appears to rotate clockwise. Possible reasons have been proposed, but none have been accepted.<br><br>Finally, as to why the value can never be zero. Whatever this value of angular momentum, physics doesn<sq>t care that we classify the cloud as a single object. As it moves through space, things can interact with it; adding mass, losing mass, being blown apart. The cloud is just a bunch of atoms and molecules. And these things have individual spins. And it turns out that their individual spins all add up to produce a net spin for the whole cloud. Some spin one way, some spin another way, but they never perfectly cancel each other out. Even if they did, just by interacting with each other they can alter the way they spin, preserving total momentum but imparting a spin direction to the entire cloud.<br><br>So the initial cloud *had* to have *some* angular momentum. This angular momentum was preserved as the cloud collapsed, and in order to preserve it, the spin speed of the cloud increased. By the time planets were forming, the Sun and the gaseous disk in the Solar System were all spinning in that same direction quite rapidly.</p>",

The red dwarf would no doubt influence the evolution of life on Earth. We might see new forms of plant life that evolved to absorb the types of light emitted from the red dwarf.

If you need a specialized device to detect the message, you are actively *hiding* the message, which is contrary to your goal of making your presence known.<br>- You want to make sure that your message *is* read. The universe is a big place, and there is a lot of noise everywhere. To monitor the whole sky in all possible frequencies, and then crunch all that data, is quite a big task.

                "answer": "<p>Particles never lose angular momentum - it must be conserved. Particles *can* lose energy through radiation though. But this requires collisions. Two particles collide *inelastically*, converting some of their kinetic energy into internal energy within the particles - one or both of the particles becomes <dq>excited<dq>. A particle can then radiate this energy away, settling down into its ground state. This photon will usually escape the system entirely. So kinetic energy can be lost from the system through collisions. For a gas, the kinetic energy is related to the *temperature* of the gas, so we call this <dq>radiative cooling<dq>. However, each collision must conserve momentum - both linear and angular momentum - and this is never lost.<br><br>So if you have particles that collide a lot, they can lose energy (while maintaining their angular momentum), and they collapse into a disc, which is the structure that has the least energy possible while still conserving angular momentum. But if your particles don<sq>t collide into each other, they can<sq>t lose energy, and they stay as a big puffy ball instead.<br><br>Note that I haven<sq>t needed to say what the particles *are* yet. This is because it doesn<sq>t matter<colon> all that matters is whether these particles collide with each other often. For a gas, particles collide fairly frequently, so it collapses into a thin disc of gas, which then forms stars, producing a disc of stars. But we can consider an entire star to be a particle too. Stars don<sq>t collide with each other very often at all, so if you have a big ball of stars, then it will remain as a big ball - that<sq>s why we can have elliptical galaxies. We only have discs because stars form from the gas that was in a disc.<br><br>So with dark matter, we again don<sq>t really need to know what it is to come to conclusions about it. For this particular problem, it doesn<sq>t matter if dark matter consists of a new type of exotic weakly interacting particle, or of something like a big population of asteroids too small to detect (although there are reasons we favour the exotic particle solution). Either way, the <dq>particles<dq> don<sq>t collide with each other often, and the dark matter halo maintains its shape as a big puffy spherical-ish blob.</p>",

Rocky planets and moons, after they formed, are essentially a blob of molten rock and iron (again, not an astronomer, don<sq>t take the details literally), because of all the energy of everything crashing into eachother. Skipping a lot of stuff, they eventually cool down, the crust is the first thing to solidify, radiating their heat away into space. But there<sq>s still a lot heat left over, and actually, all the radiactive material fissioning helps keeping the interiors of the planet molten. But small moons solidify completly relatively quickly regardless, while bigger objects like earth take longer, like billions of years.<br><br>Ok, let<sq>s take a step back<colon> crust recently solidified. What does the athmosphere look like? There<sq>s no water yet (we<sq>ll come back to that), free oxygen like in todays athmosphere get<sq>s eaten up by chemical processes pretty quickly (life is required to replenish it). The athmosphere comes from the planets interior! Vulcanism! And Volcanos spew out a lot of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide (and other stuff). So, it<sq>s toxic and deadly and hot. <br><br>Next, a little later, lots and lots and lots of water rich coments strikes the planets, giving them oceans. The water and weather help clean the athmosphere of toxic stuff. Also, the vulcanism is slowing down, it<sq>s not quite as hellish anymore, which means the replenishment of the gases is slowing down.<br><br>If the body cools out completly, vulcanism stops, which means repleishment of CO2 stops, techtonic activity stops, and the magnetic field dissapears.<br><br>Ok, getting to the point now<colon> Mars never look like earth today, and Earth never looked like Venus today. But there was a time when they all looked similar, *at the time*. Mars <dq>looked like Earth<dq> because it had lots of water on it (Venus too, but unproovable), and Earth <dq>looked like Venus<dq> because Venus is essentially stuck in a similar situation as shorty after it<sq>s formation<colon> lot<sq>s of vulcanism, toxic gases accumulating in the athmosphere, but it<sq>s much more extreme now than it was before.<br><br>There<sq>s a lot I skipped over, don<sq>t jump to conclusions based on what I said, instead, look up the formation history of the planets. As for your questions<colon><br><br>> Could we assume that the changes in these planets climate are directly correlated to our sun changing size?<br><br>The sun is getting *warmer*, ever so slightly, forever, until it dies, and this has and will affect the climate on the planets. Earth used to be completly frozen over a couple of times, only the accumulating CO2 (which isn<sq>t washed out if the rocky surface is frozen over) from from Vulcanism saved us. This probably couldn<sq>t happen anymore (the freezing), because the sun is to warm now. In the future, Earth might end up similar to Venus. The greenhouse effect is why Earth has been warm enough for liquid water for this long, but if it<sq>s warm enough *without* it, we might end up with the same runaway greenhouse effect like Venus (but this depends on a couple of factors).<br><br>> So eventually when the sun gets smaller (?) the Earth will look like Mars, and Venus will look like Earth and be able to support life?<br><br>The suns size hasn<sq>t significantly changed, and won<sq>t for a long while. Only at the very end, it will grow *huge* quite suddenly, eating up Mercury, Venus, and the Earth, and then collaps into a (earth sized) white dwarf. At that point, it<sq>s considered a stellar remnant; it<sq>s dead.<br><br>> Can a rocky planet like Mars ever turn into a gaseous planet like Jupiter (extending the chain)? <br><br>No, not after the solar system has finished forming. The star an the planets and everything else form simultaniously. The formation of solar systems is a hot subject with lots of uncertainties, but in any case, the gas giants need, well, *gas* to form. Once the Star ignites, all the leftover gas is blown out of the system, so even if Mars somehow got big enough to hold Hydrogen in it<sq>s athmosphere, there isn<sq>t any gas left to pick up.<br><br>Again, not an astronomer, besides the errors I probably made, I know a lot of the details are simplified to the point of beeing wrong.

But the other parameter that influences this is [metallicity](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity), where a lower metallicity induces a higher temperature for a certain mass (and vice versa). So for a mass of 0.95 * solar this makes sense if you induce Fe/H \u2248 -0.3 (metallicity is measured on a log scale, so that<sq>s 10^-0.3 \u2248 0.5 times solar).<br><br>Now, mass and effective temperature can be combined with age to interpolate radius and, hence, luminosity. I can<sq>t exactly do isochrones in my head, but I<sq>m going to estimate that for a mass of 0.95 * solar, an effective temperature of 5998 K and an age of 5.6 Gyr (you say 1 Gyr older than the Sun, but 9.5 Gyr after the big bang is 0.3 Gyr younger than Sol) that its radius would be ~0.97 * solar and a luminosity of ~1.00 * solar (which is a happy coincidence)<br><br>To wrap up, an effective temperature of 5998 K indicates a spectral type of G0, and it is on the main sequence, so it is G0V. Because its luminosity is solar (give or take a few percent), habitable zone calculations can use the Solar system as a proxy. Finally, Fe/H = -0.3 implies that the star likely does not have any giant planets (increasing metallicity implies an increasing giant planet abundance on a logarithmic scale, and vice versa, and for Fe/H = -0.3 planets more massive than ~0.1 * Jupiter = ~30 * Earth occur around approximately [2/100 stars](http<colon>//arxiv.org/pdf/1302.1851v1.pdf)) but does not particularly influence the occurrence of smaller planets (occurrence of planets below ~0.1 * Jupiter is discernably irrespective of metallicity and is increasing for decreasing mass, to the extent where planets with similar masses to earth have occurrences of ~\u22651 per star).<br><br>I like this idea you<sq>ve got going on, though the fancy literature goes over my head a bit. I could give a lot of input on the planetary system, though I<sq>m not experienced in anything of lower order than planetary physical parameters (exogeology is a weird concept!).

In order to fuse two protons together, the density has to be very high. It needs a lot of energy to get that close. However when the atoms fuse, the energy released is greater than what it took to get the two protons to fuse. This energy pushes the core out, while the mass of the sun is forcing it to contract via gravity. Therefore, the sun is in constant equilibrium and a small percentage of hydrogen is actually fusing.<br><br>Strictly speaking with hydrogen fusion, the less massive a star is, the longer it will burn because this equilibrium point is achieved at a lower temperature. These are red and brown dwarfs, moving up to main sequence stars.  The more massive a star gets, the hotter it burns. These are blue giants, blue supergiants, and blue hyper giants.<br><br>Edit<colon> our sun only fuses hydrogen at the moment. Once it<sq>s used up, the core contracts and the outer layers expand, forming a red giant. This is when other fusion begins, so helium will be next. After the helium is used up, the star will contract back down into a white dwarf. If it is massive enough, the star will repeat the core contracting/outer layer expanding process again and again, fusing heavier and heavier elements.</p>",

The sun generates about the same amount of heat as a compost heap - a million times the mass of the earth compost heap. Mammals like (most) redditors produce more heat per unit volume than the sun. The density in the core is up to 150 times the density of water -10 times the density of lead - and the temperature is 15,000,000 degrees kelvin but the rate of fusion is puny.

Booyah.<br><br>ALRIGHT so you<sq>re got two types of star cluster. You<sq>ve got your globular star clusters and your open star clusters. Globular star clusters are really tight packed balls of like 10,000 stars or so. They<sq>re called <dq>globular<dq> because they<sq>re shaped like globes. There<sq>s about a hundred or so of them in the Milky Way, and they<sq>re all really old. All of the big bright stars in them have burnt out, so what<sq>s left is just the small dim old stars. The cool thing about them is we don<sq>t really know where they come from. We understand the basic idea of star formation (gas collapses into stars, and if you have a lot of gas in one area you<sq>re going to end up with a bunch of stars), but we really haven<sq>t figured out exactly why the galaxy decided to make a hundred or so of these really tight globular star clusters really early on. So that<sq>s globular clusters.<br><br>Then there<sq>s open star clusters. An open star cluster is just a bunch of stars that formed in the same nebula. More precisely, these nebulae are <dq>molecular clouds<dq>, which means they<sq>re cold enough that hydrogen can form molecules (H2) instead of just say, hydrogen atoms floating around by themselves (or even protons and electrons floating around separately). These nebulae can be fairly large. It<sq>s a bit over a parsec to the closest star to the sun, and you can have molecular clouds that are over ten parsecs across. They also have a lot of mass, weighing in at thousands of times the mass of our sun. So these things are pretty big, and so instead of the molecular cloud collapsing into a single star, you get collapse happening all over the molecular cloud, and it ends up producing a hundred stars or so in about the same area - an open star cluster. These stars quickly heat up the rest of the molecular cloud and shove it back into the general galactic stew, and this is helped along by the fact that a bunch of the particularly enthusiastic stars will blow their load and go supernova fairly quickly. As a result, within about 10 million years, you go from a molecular cloud forming to it getting blasted away, and you get a nice open star cluster left behind. These open star clusters aren<sq>t nice and tightly bound together like a globular star cluster, so over time they tend to slowly break apart, and eventually the stars end up getting mixed in with all the other stars in the galaxy.</p>",

A star is a giant mass of mostly hydrogen gas (at the time of its creation) that has reached a homogeneous balance between the inward force of gravity and the outward force of the nuclear explosion taking place in the core.<br><br>Since massive stars have much more gravitational force, they also must be counter-balanced by a much stronger nuclear reaction occurring in the core. If you model these relationships, you will see that the strength of the gravitational pressure is not linear with the mass of the star, so rather than live the same length of time, massive stars undergo disproportionately violent nuclear reactions compared to smaller stars, leading them to consume their fuel more quickly. </p>",

However, for objects more distant than that, the effect becomes more pronounced, and can have a significant effect on distance measurements.<br><br>For example, consider the quasar PG 1634+706 in Draco. Astronomers have measured its redshift to be about *z* = 1.337, which means it<sq>s receding away from us at a very high speed. When you run through the calculations (which come from general relativity), you find that the light from the quasar took ~9.1 billion years to reach us. Thus, you could claim that the quasar is 9.1 billion light-years away (we call this the *light-travel distance*, *light-travel time*, or *lookback time* depending on the context). However, this doesn<sq>t take into account that the space between us and the quasar expanded significantly while the light was on its 9.1 billion year-long journey to Earth. When you factor this in to the equation, you find that the quasar is currently ~13.6 billion light-years away from us (we call this the *proper distance*). You can also run the clock backwards and find that when the light originally left the quasar, the quasar was much closer to us at a distance of ~5.8 billion light-years (this is called the *angular diameter distance*).<br><br>Clear skies!</p>",

It is very difficult for us to observe the galaxy in which we reside on the large scale that it takes to deduce the overall shape. This is due to the fact that our galaxy is full of gas and dust which blocks our view of all but the nearest parts. Using other wavelengths of light allows us to map areas that we cannot observe visually. Radio Astronomy in particular is very good at penetrating features that block visual wavelengths. I am relatively certain that you could probably still find a few astronomers that would argue the Milky Way was not a barred spiral. The evidence is very suggestive, but we are a long way from having definitively mapped our own galaxy. In many ways we know a lot more about the nearest external galaxies than we do about our own. I have been following astronomy since the 1960<sq>s, and I first came across the barred spiral hypothesis in the late 70<sq>s or early 80<sq>s. When I was a kid I always wished that the Milky Way could have been a barred spiral, so I was pretty excited when I heard about it.

Here<sq>s a few criticisms I have<colon><br><br>In order to create a working telescope surface, you need to control the location and orientation of each reflective panel to better than 1/10th of a wavelength. If you want to deal with 1m radio waves, that<sq>s only 10 cm, but most radio astronomy is done below the 1m band. If you want to work with 1cm wavelengths, you need to control your reflectors with at least 1mm precision. Do you really think your balloons can do this, cheaply?<br><br>Why use balloons at all? Why use a non-rigid material, that can flex, expand/contract under heat/cold, move in the wind? What does a balloon do that a cheap steel rod stuck in the ground can<sq>t do?<br><br>I<sq>m guessing your design include a lot of gaps between the reflectors, like in the picture of the solar power station in your document. This would be a huge problem, because these gaps would act as a scattering surface for radio waves (the equivalent of white paint, which scatters optical light in all directions), which would cause radio waves from random directions to reflect towards the receiver. The result is a very high level of background noise, which would eliminate the benefit of whatever large collecting area you have.<br><br>Also, if the receiver and the reflectors are fixed, then you have no directional control and can only look at one direction (although different parts of the sky will move in and out of view as the Earth rotates). The field of view (the amount of sky that can be seen at one time) changes as the inverse square of the telescope diameter, so if you want to make a telescope with 100x the collecting area of FAST, you need at a minimum 10x the diameter, so you<sq>ll see 100x less of the sky at any given time. Without any steering, the total area of the sky that can be seen (by waiting for the Earth to spin it over the telescope). A rough calculation suggests that you could see roughly 0.01<percent> of the whole sky with such a system. Such a telescope would be completely pointless.<br><br>So you need a steerable telescope. Aricebo and FAST do this by moving the receiver cabin around in the focal plane of the reflector. But now this is not something you can mount on a simple mast; it has to be able to move. The easiest way is to emulate the design of Aricebo and FAST by having multiple masts and suspending the receiver on ropes. But this becomes a much more massive engineering challenge, because you<sq>re dealing with more complicated forces<colon> rather than just holding something up, you have these ropes putting horizontal forces on the towers, which then require much more substantial reinforcement to survive that much torque and strain.<br><br>You also briefly describe putting in some sort of pneumatic or hydraulic system to control the balloons and the reflectors. Leaving aside the cost of construction, this adds enormously to the operating cost<colon> this adds a truly enormous number of moving parts and pressurized components, which will fail regularly and need repair and replacement.<br><br>I don<sq>t mean this to be discouraging; part of being a scientist is criticizing your own ideas and having others criticize your ideas without holding back.

You couldn<sq>t just add and subtract velocities (*= translating between inertial reference frames*) to get the right result. But they figured out how to translate between reference frames eventually, with [Lorentz Transformations](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation). Great stuff. But all these equations now also spew out a weird number, ~300<sq>000 km/s. It<sq>s a **c**onstant that just shows up in the equations of electromagnetism. Oh, and the centuries-old Galilean Relativity is broken. What<sq>s going on?<br><br>Einstein put the pieces together. He realized that the simple add and subtract of Galilean Relativity must be replaced with Lorentz Transformations not just for electromagnetism, but for All The Things,  and that distances and the passing of time itself depend on the reference frame you are in. And a bunch of [other subtilties about inertial reference frames](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance#Newton.27s_theory_versus_special_relativity). And in this new description of the universe, there must be a cosmic speed limit (c, the constant), or otherwise, everything would just happen in an instant. Nothing would happen after some other thing. There would be no cause and effect. The constant, that was staring in their faces for decades, was the speed of causality. Also, light is a massless particle that, like all other massless particles, travels with the speed of c and doesn<sq>t experience any time.  <br><br><br>For an entierly different view on how to interpret space time / speed of light / time dilation / etc, this is a fun read<colon> <br><br>https<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fjwkh/why_exactly_can_nothing_go_faster_than_the_speed/c1gh4x7<br><br>I hope this helps to shed some light on the matter.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>C is not infinite. C is a constant, a measure of the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a given time. That said, it is more a measure of the relationship between time and distance, as both of these are not constants. <br><br>Think about this for a second. If you move very fast, approaching the speed of light, you will experience a squished perspective of the universe. Say a train was heading into a tunnel which had doors on either end that could close for an instant. Assume the train is 1.5 times the length of the tunnel at normal speeds. If the train is going fast enough, to an outside observer it will be contracted by its motion, allowing it to fit inside the tunnel so both doors can close at once. <br><br>The interesting thing about this is a different perspective. From inside the train you will see the door at the end of the tunnel close and open, then the train move through until the back is in line with the first door, then the first door close and open. This is totally different to what the outside observer saw. <br><br>You can see in this experiment that both time and length are warped at high speed, but an interesting side effect is that continuity is also broken, meaning that we can disagree about the order of events as well as the size of objects depending on our frame of reference. <br><br>Ultimately, the speed of light is a constant, even in a non vacuum, because while it takes more time to pass through something like misted glass, the actual speed is the same, the distance is just longer because it is not a direct path. <br><br>C is a constant, everything else is slower, and as you increase your speed you are doing something else which is fascinating. <br><br>Imagine you have a ball in your hand. Now raise it up above your head. Is the ball the same weight as it was before you lifted it? <br><br>The answer is no, it took on gravitational potential energy, thus becoming slightly heavier. This is because mass and energy are not nearly as distinct as you may think. <br><br>In the same way, as you make something faster you are adding kinetic energy. This increases the mass of the object, making the next round of acceleration take more energy. When something gets massively fast, in the order of percentages of the speed of light, they gain massive amounts of mass (excuse the pun), becoming harder to accelerate. Once it reaches a comparable speed to light it takes so much energy to accelerate it, it is essentially impossible. <br><br>If you want a more detailed understanding, look into the Higgs Field and mass/energy equivalence. </p>",

Surface gravity goes like M/R^2 , so if you wanted R to be ~10x bigger than Earth, the mass would have to be 100 times more than Earth. That would lead to a density M/(4/3 pi R^3 ) of < 1 g/cm^3 , so lighter than water (i.e. gas giant, not rocky). What do exist are [Super Earths](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Earth) which could be several times bigger than Earth, still rocky, and with normal-ish gravity. For example, look at [Kepler-68b](http<colon>//exoplanets.org/detail/Kepler-68_b). It has a radius about 20<percent> of Jupiter, or about twice Earth, surface gravity about 10<percent> more than on Earth, and an average density of about 3 g/cm^3 which says it<sq>s most likely rocky/watery, possibly with a thick atmosphere.<br><br>As for dynamics, a binary pair of planets with a lot of moons might be difficult, since I would expect eventually you<sq>d get close encounters that end up ejecting moons from the system.

                "answer": "<p>To give a broad answer<colon><br><br>The orbit of the ISS is inclined by 51.65 degrees.  This means that, on every orbit around the Earth, it gets as far as 51.65\u00b0N, and when it gets to the other side of the planet, it drops to 51.65\u00b0S.  Because the north/south value of the orbit behaves as a sine wave, the station spends more time near the peaks of its orbit than you may expect, and less time around the equator.  [For example](http<colon>//www.scibuff.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/beta-angle.png), look at the amount of distance the station spends above 30\u00b0N, as compared to the time it spends between the equator and 30\u00b0N.<br><br>It<sq>s worth noting that this inclination was implemented so that construction and resupply launches from both the United States and from Russia can easily match the orbit of the station.  If the station orbited above the equator, launches would need to expend more fuel to match the station<sq>s trajectory.<br><br>Now, the station orbits the Earth about every 93 minutes.  That means that the station orbits the Earth 16 times per day, and that if it<sq>s above point (x,y) on the Earth, it will return to roughly the same point 16 orbits later.  (This isn<sq>t exactly true because the division isn<sq>t perfect, but it<sq>s approximate.)  What this means is that, on each orbit, the station will appear to <dq>shift<dq> a little bit further across the surface of the Earth.  On a flat map, this shift looks something like [this](http<colon>//astrobob.areavoices.com/files/2013/10/ISS_Path-400x199.jpg).  When you map it to a globe, the coverage pattern for a full day<sq>s worth of orbits would look more like [this](http<colon>//www.nlsa.com/images/gallery/large/gallery1.gif).<br><br>One final note, then, is that atmospheric drag on the station causes its orbit to degrade to the tune of roughly 2km/month.  So on every orbit, the station gets a little bit closer to Earth.  As it<sq>s orbit lowers, the station<sq>s speed increases slightly.  Every so often, the station gets boosted into a higher orbit, which yields an [altitude graph](http<colon>//media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/msnbc/Components/Art/TECH/070315/Space_station_altitude.gif) full of slow curves downward and sharp spikes upward.<br><br>So in summary, from the perspective of the station, it<sq>s always traveling in a straight line with a planet sliding beneath it, pulling that straight line into an orbital ellipse.  From the perspective of us standing on the surface, it sort of weaves back and forth across the surface, slowly trying to crash-land but is saved by some rocket boosters.</p>",

Keep in mind though, that my answers are specific to where I work - others may have other input.<br><br>1. To observe at our facility you need to submit a Viewing Proposal. This includes things like your target, date, instruments needed, etc.  The proposal is then reviewed to make sure it fits our capabilities, available viewing times, and ability to view the target.  If it fits, then you get the viewing time.  Once you have your data, you are guaranteed a time period (on the order of a couple of years) to pour over it and write up your papers.<br><br>2. Usually universities. Many observatories are collaborations between various universities.  Instruments used in observatories are also usually collaborations between universities.  Also involved are heavy-weights such as NASA, Smithsonian, etc.<br><br>3. We hire a huge number of various positions.  There are both day-time workers and night-time workers.  (We<sq>re optical/IR, not radio).  Since observing happens at night, there has to be night-crew, plane spotters (for our AO laser deployment) etc.  During the daytime there are day-crew, who does upkeep on the telescope, instrument designers and maintainers, etc.  Then there are the computer scientists, support scientists, astronomers, computer division, engineers, etc.  So basically an observatory runs 24/7, but with different crews at different times.</p>",

This is typically what happens for transient events such as supernova explosions.

Astronomers are either with a university, or with a dedicated orgranisation for astronomy such as ASTRON in the Netherlands or NRAO in the USA. The obseravories are often either co-owned by a group of universities, or built and operated by such a dedicated astronomy organisation (ASTRON runs WSRT and LOFAR, NRAO runs the VLBA and JVLA etc.)<br><br>3.

Oort, upon hearing of the first radio astronomy observations, asked his colleague van der Hulst to calculate if there might be any spectral lines in the radio frequencie spectrum, hoping that such radiation would pass through the dust unhindered. Van der Hulst went to work on this and famously predicted the 21cm (1420 MHz) spectral line of neutral atomic Hydrogen. After World War 2, serious efforts to detect this spectral line were started. In Holland, they used an old German radar station left behind after the occupation ended, but had many problems getting their receiver to work at such a high frequency. Meanwhile in the USA, Ewen and Purcell at Harvard managed to detect Hydrogen 21cm radiation for the first time. The Dutch were soon able to do this as well, and using their (formerly German) 7.5m diameter dish antenna (<sq>Wuerzburger<sq>), began mapping the Milkyway.<br><br>The HI line (H for hydrogen, then a subscript capital I, pronouced H-one) is very narrow, its frequency is precisely 1420.40575177 MHz. However, due to the rotations of our Milkyway, this signal is doppler-shifted up and down by about 2MHz. This doppler shift, together with an assumed model of the rotation of the Galaxy, gives an indication of the distance of the Hydrogen signal that is being measured. By mapping out the doppler shift and intensity versus the direction the telescope is pointing into the Milky Way, Oort could make the first map of our own Galaxy. This already showed its spiral structure.<br><br>From the Netherlands, parts of the Galaxy (including its core) never rise above the horizon. So the Dutch data was soon combined with data from Australia to make an overall map of the galaxy. This map was published in 1958<colon> <dq>Oort, J.H., Kerr, F.J., and Westerhout, G., 1958.

So in the linked gif, we<sq>re looking at an absolutely huge black hole, but like everything else, there is a distance from it at which you could safely orbit and navigate as if it were just a bunch of matter in some other configuration. <br><br>Second thing is that the physical <dq>size<dq> of the black hole is the size of what<sq>s known as the event horizon, as the mass may be all centrally contained in an infinitely compact point. The event horizon is just the distance from this centre at which light, the fastest possible thing, is still not fast enough to avoid falling inward. So anything within the event horizon emitting light won<sq>t be seen outside that horizon. More importantly, our current understanding of physics cannot be applied to the space within that horizon (if indeed the concept of space still exists in there). Movies and stuff will show things, pop science books will describe some of the cooler theories, but there<sq>s no known answer as to what it<sq>s like <dq>inside<dq>. <br><br>So interestingly, in the case of a supermassive black hole like the one pictured, you can be near the event horizon and not actually have huge gravitational chaos happening around you.

For the solar system obviously this difference would be greater, because it<sq>s a big system, but for a big enough black hole even the solar system would be safe. <br><br>Unfortunately, once we cross the event horizon, there<sq>s no way to know if we<sq>d still feel mild gravity from the black hole and just have a black sky. Or if we<sq>d still have the same physical rules as we<sq>re used to now. There<sq>s just no way to know until new physics is found that can tell us how that works. </p>",

Also make them list their viewing conditions. then they can compare their observations with others with different size scopes! They will see that sometimes darker skies(no moon, no light pollution ) makes for better observing than having a bigger scope. For beginners you can have them draw a different constellation each month. Have them draw all the stars they see in that particular area, not just the ones that make up the constellation itself!

Of course this cannot happen to anything that has mass, but in the early 1960<sq>s the Tachyon was proposed to be a quantum field with negative mass that had the capability to propagate backwards in time. Later work showed that the Tachyon was an instability in a field with imaginary mass and could not travel back in time, even theoretically. The concept of imaginary mass is still used in theoretical physics however. Wanting not to miss anything, even the impossible, physicists still set up their experiments with the ability to detect faster than light particles, just in case. Physicists have spent quite a bit of time and effort trying to come up with schemes that would allow traveling into the past. There are some that use black holes and worm holes that look like they should be able to succeed, but there is always some consideration like being destroyed or needing a substance with negative mass that doesn<sq>t exist that keep them from working.

This is a genuine paradox, a causal contradiction.<br>They concluded that superluminal particles such as tachyons are therefore not allowed to convey signals.<br>In recent decades, there have been various proposed ways to possibly remove such paradoxes, either by invoking the Novikov self-consistency principle or through the idea of branching timelines in the context of the many-worlds interpretation.</p>",

While it is true that both planets have alot of moons (76 and 62 respectively), most of them are tiny rocks that are likely captured asteroids and therefore not as significant as larger moons. <br><br>Taking hydrostatical equlibrium as criterion, Jupiter has 4 moons, while saturn has 7, which is a noticable difference. Though, except for Titan, these moons are much smaller than the 4 large jovian ones. Titan is also an exception in that it is the only moon with a dense atmosphere and covered with lakes of hydrocarbons, which no other moon has. <br><br>Saturns large moons, again with the exception of Titan, are generally icy bodies with a high albedo (reflectivity). [Enceladus](https<colon>//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Enceladusstripes_cassini.jpg) is whiter than fresh snow here on earth and has a reflectivity of over 99<percent>, making it the most reflective large body in the solar system. Enceladus is also known for having cryvolcanism, which suggest it has an ocean of liquid water under its surface.<br><br>Iapetus has [two hemispheres](https<colon>//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_<percent>28Mond<percent>29#/media/File<colon>Iapetus_as_seen_by_the_Cassini_probe_-_20071008.jpg), one of which is really bright and ice covered, while the other one is darker than asphalt. The reason for this might be a stream of dark particles coming from the moon Phoebe, although another explanation would be that the dark particles were released upon impacts. We aren<sq>t  sure as of yet. <br><br>Another interesting moon is Mimas, which has a [crater](https<colon>//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Mimas_Cassini.jpg) that is so large, that the moon was almost completely disrupted when the impact occured. It has become somewhat famous, as it resembles the death star from star wars, while the probes that made the nearby photos of the moon entered the Saturn system only after the film was released.<br><br>The system is also interesting in the way that some of the smaller moons act as shepherd moons for the rings, holding them together. The moon Phoebe seems also responsible for the existance of Saturn<sq>s [largest ring](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_<percent>28moon<percent>29#/media/File<colon>Saturn_largest_ring_Spitzer_telescope_20091006.jpg).<br><br>Comparatively, the 4 large moons of Jupiter are different in size and composition. While Titan with a diameter of 5150 km is the second-largest moon in the solar system, the next-largest moon of Saturn, Rhea, has only a diameter of 1527 km. The range of the galilean moons is from 3122 to 5262 km. <br><br>The smallest of them, [Europa](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_<percent>28moon<percent>29#/media/File<colon>Europa-moon.jpg), resembles the moons of Saturn the most, also still significantly larger. It has probably also an ocean under the ice, like encaladus does. <br><br>[Io](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_<percent>28moon<percent>29#/media/File<colon>Io_highest_resolution_true_color.jpg) is slightly largewr than Europa and is the body with the highest volcanic activity in the solar system. Due to it, the moon has almost no craters. <br><br>Ganymed and Callisto are two massive objects. Ganymed is the only moon with its own magnetosphere. It is also the largest moon in the solar system. It has a distinct surface with various features. Comparatively, Callisto<sq>s surface is extremely old and covered with so many craters, that each new impact is likely to erasy a previous one. <br><br>There are more differences than that, but i hope my text gives a basic idea. </p>",

Light contributes to cosmology in much the same way as matter does, by that I mean as the expands the energy density decreases. This is perfectly understandable for matter, if you increase the volume of some gas at a fixed amount of particles the density falls. For matter the energy density falls as the universe expands to the third power (3 dimensions). For light there is an additional effect as the universe expands because not only is it diluted like matter in the large volume but it is redshifted. So light looses energy as space expands to the 4th power. Interesting this difference in scaling means that if you wind the clock back there was a time when light dominated over matter but it<sq>s effect now is very marginal. Light is included in detailed cosmological calculations.<br><br>We don<sq>t know what dark energy is exactly but we have constraints and neither light nor normal matter are compatible with the constraints on it<sq>s <dq>equation of state<dq>. The equation of state says how the energy density of dark energy changes as the universe expands, we don<sq>t know exactly but we know it<sq>s close to no change at all. No change at all is what the simplest model predicts, the Cosmological Constant. It<sq>s aesthetically appealing also as it only has a single parameter.<br><br>>the universe expanded slower immediately after the big bang than it currently does, and that the acceleration rate increased after the quark-gluon soup cleared enough to allow light to finally penetrate the darkness.<br><br>I don<sq>t believe that<sq>s true. The epoch of recombination is what you<sq>re referring to which wasn<sq>t quark-qluon plasma but regular plasma, it should have no affect on the expansion of the universe as far as I can think of. In standard cosmology the only epochs of acceleration are now under dark energy and in the very early universe with inflation, the latter was much before recombination. Photons contribute to the deceleration of the universe. There was an effect on the change in the rate of the expansion of the universe when matter came to dominate over light but that wasn<sq>t recombination. That change wasn<sq>t an acceleration, it was a change in the rate of deceleration.</p>",

When a planet passes in front of the star, Kepler will see a dip in the light of the star, which represents the planetary transit. The depth of this dip tells you the relative size of the planet to the star.<br><br>This trick wouldn<sq>t work for a planet-forming disk. Why? Because planet-forming disks are more or less symmetric disks in their orbit<colon> they block out the same amount of light at every moment, and you wouldn<sq>t see a rise and fall in the light curve.<br><br>This wouldn<sq>t be strictly correct; there will be inhomogeneities in the disk, and these inhomogeneities will eventually form planets. But the signals of planets amongst a large dust disk will be considerably reduced.<br><br>So Kepler wouldn<sq>t really see the kinematic signatures of a planet-forming disk in the brightness of the star. It would see something interesting though. Planet-forming disks only occur around very young stars, and very young stars have incredible amounts of stellar activity<colon> hot outflows, outbursts, convection, and solar flares. So (TL;DR) I suspect a star with a planet-forming disk wouldn<sq>t have a detectable disk, but it WOULD have significant variations in brightness that correspond to some pretty awesome stellar activity.<br><br>EDIT<colon> To be clear, the violent intrinsic changes in the brightness of a young star will swamp any signal from a clumpy planet-forming disk. Disentangling planetary signals from stellar activity (especially periodic stellar activity, like starspots) is one of the big challenges of finding planets via the transit method in a *normal* stellar system, and young stellar systems with planet-forming disks will compound this problem immensely.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>There are a lot of questions, and a lot of short answers in this thread, so I<sq>d like to take a bit of time to write some more detailed answers<colon><br><br>How do we figure out what belongs to one galaxy vs another?<br><br>In most cases, this is clear-cut. For isolated galaxies, the typical scale of a galaxy is something like 100,000 lightyears, while the typical distance between galaxies is of order a few million lightyears. So there is a 10<colon>1 scale difference, which implies that for typical lines-of-sight to a nearby galaxy, something like the nearest 5<percent> would be our Galaxy, 90<percent> would be mostly empty space (come back to that in a bit), and the last 5<percent> would be the other galaxy. While the galaxies themselves don<sq>t have clear-cut edges (see below), the break between them is clear enough to allow for easy separation.<br><br>There are, however, some cases that make this more complicated. There are interacting/colliding galaxies, where there is no gap between the galaxies. In these cases, we can use the kinematics (the motions of the individual parts in each galaxy) to try to disentangle them. We can measure Doppler shifts for distance objects fairly easily, so it<sq>s relatively straightforward to build up models for the rotation/motion of each galaxy. We can then look at the motion of any given object, and say something like <dq>it<sq>s orbital motion is closer to that of galaxy A than galaxy B, so it probably belongs to A, even though it<sq>s halfway between the centers of each.<dq>  If the collision is leading to a merger, then at some point we can<sq>t differentiate between the two populations any more, and we classify it as a single merged galaxy.<br><br>The other complicated case is dwarf galaxies, which are small galaxies typically found orbiting much larger galaxies. These can have overlap/interactions with the parent galaxy, so drawing a dividing line between them is not always obvious. Again, the best way is usually through kinematics; we can often say whether a particular object is orbiting around the parent galaxy or orbiting around the dwarf. Gravitational potential plays a big role in this<colon> if an object does not have enough energy to escape from the gravity of the dwarf galaxy, then we say it<sq>s definitely bound to the dwarf and belongs to it. This can change over time, as interactions between objects can transfer energy and allow some objects to escape.<br><br>Speaking of gravitational potential, this is also what allows us to make a dividing line between what belongs to a galaxy vs objects that are free. If an object has enough energy to overcome the gravitational potential, it is on an escape trajectory and will eventually leave the galaxy never to return. We see some of these types of objects in our Galaxy, called hyper-velocity stars. These are stars that have been given a strong push (say from being at the center of a supernova) and now have enough energy/speed (more than around 200 km/s) to leave the galaxy forever.  I don<sq>t know if we have found any such objects outside of the <sq>edges<sq> of our Galaxy, since they quickly become very difficult to find as they are further away.<br><br>So to specifically answer your question about what variables are considering when deciding membership in a galaxy<colon> position relative to the host galaxy, and velocity.<br><br>On <sq>mostly empty space<sq> and the edges of the galaxy<colon><br><br>Looking only at the stars, there is no really a clear-cut edge to our Galaxy (or any galaxy, really). We know from observations that the density of stars decreases with radius, approximately as an exponential decay with a scale length of something like 10000 lightyears or so. There<sq>s also a decrease in density away from the midplane of the disk (remember that for a spiral galaxy like ours, most of the stars are confined to narrow disk), this is typically modeled as a combination of two exponential distributions, one with a scale height of about 1000 lightyears and another with a scale height of around 3000 lightyears.<br><br>These radial and vertical distributions fit the data quite well quite far out from the center, often as far out as 5-10 scale lengths. This corresponds to densities of something like e^{-5} to e^{-10} times the peak density, so this a very very low density of stars. Beyond these distances (radii of 50-100 thousand lightyears) the density of stars gets too small to easily measure.<br><br>One of my own research specialties is the interstellar medium, the stuff that exists in galaxies between the stars (gas, dust, and plasma, mostly). The existence of the interstellar medium, and the corresponding intergalactic medium, add somewhat to the complexity of the problem of edges of galaxies. The atomic hydrogen gas in the Galaxy follows similar distributions to the stars, but with larger scale lengths; the gas disk is often detectable out to twice as far the stars when looking at other galaxies. <br><br>There is also a very hot, very low density ionized plasma component that essentially fills up all the volume of the Galaxy that isn<sq>t occupied by other matter. This hot plasma (called the Hot Ionized Medium, HIM) cools so slowly that it is kept in temperature equilibrium by interactions with stray X-rays and cosmic rays, and is in pressure equilibrium with the other matter and with the gravitational potential created the Galaxy and its stars. At some distance the gravitational potential of our Galaxy is roughly equal to that of other nearby galaxies, so it becomes impossible to say whether a given piece of plasma belongs to one galaxy or the other.  We generally just classify such material as intergalactic medium, and don<sq>t bother drawing sharp boundaries between where the interstellar HIM ends and the intergalactic medium starts.<br><br>>when i glanced at the wikipedia article i could not understand what makes a galaxy a galaxy ... or see a scientific definition for it. i m feeling that astronomy is found on a very shaky foundation... i really hope i m proven wrong and there are mathematical-based definations for galaxies, clusters of galaxies and star systems etc. <br><br>The definitions for galaxies and not rigorously defined in the way that you<sq>re thinking. We can see clear examples of different classes of objects, such as globular star clusters, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies, but there are also examples of objects that fall between these classes. As such, there is no need to create rigorous quantitatively defined categories, because an object at the upper end of one category may have more similarities to an object at the bottom of the next category than to an object at the lower end of the same category.<br><br>Instead of worrying about classification, research is focused more on understanding the processes involved in shaping all of these objects. In different regimes different processes will dominate, but there will also be intermediate cases where multiple processes interact to determine the structure/behavior/evolution of the objects. Far from putting us <dq>on a shaky foundation<dq>, as you mentioned in a comment, this focus on processes rather than categories is much more natural when considering the goals of astrophysics as a whole. (Sorry if that sounds a bit preachy, this is something I<sq>m quite passionate about.)</p>",

Infact, during a period in ~~winter~~ summer, London doesn<sq>t technically enter <dq>night<dq>, it<sq>s just permanent twillight / dawn.<br>- The above is just as true for the moon.<br>- Light pollution has a large area of effect.<br>- The local athmosphere changes things.

You<sq>d see more in the exact same condition if it where directly over your head, because there<sq>s less athmosphere to plow through.<br>- The milky way looks differently at different times / times of year. You might be looking outwards, with the galactic core under your feet. <br>- Looking at the sky and thinking that<sq>s it. You need to sit in the dark, not using your phone or lighter etc, for at least 10 minutes (It can take your eyes up to an hour to completly adjust in complete darkness, but that<sq>s diminuishing returns).<br><br>Those things make it incredably hard to get a really good look of the milky way and the andromeda galaxy. You might still see a huge amount of stars in what very much looks like a dark sky, but not a lot of galaxy. But you can do something about most of those things<colon><br><br>- Location. Just as far away from light pollution as is reasonable for you. Don<sq>t drive for hours. Mountains are *generally* better because there<sq>s less athmosphere, not much light pollution and better weather with more clear skies. But all else beeing equal, beeing on a mountain won<sq>t change *that* much. You can get good night almost everywhere. Probably less so, but you can try more often on a nearby place than you can randomly travel onto a mountain.<br>- Check with (really easy to use) software like [stellarium](http<colon>//www.stellarium.org/) for good times to go star gazing. It also simulates how things look under different condition (you can turn off the athmosphere, or see how the sun and moon even beyond the horizon affect the view), and it<sq>s actually more realistic that the usual pictures from the milky way, because cameras see things differently, and pictures are made to be pretty.<br>- Keep an eye on the weather. When they forecast good weather, remember that you could go stargazing for a change.<br>- Generally, just keep an eye on things.

Take with whatever size grain of salt you deem appropriate.<br><br>The shattered Moon is a popular image for illustrating that a cataclysmic event has taken place.  The first picture you<sq>ve linked to is from a Tom Cruise post-apocalyptic movie called [Oblivion](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivion_\\(2013_film\\)).  I believe the second was from an anime called [Origin<colon> Spirits of the Past](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin<colon>_Spirits_of_the_Past).<br><br>The short version is that the Moon wouldn<sq>t break apart in that way.  Far more likely is that somewhere between some and all of the surface of the Moon would become molten, and some amount of ejecta would fly off in trajectories dependent on the angle and speed of the comet<sq>s impact.<br><br>~~In the case of an extraordinarily energetic impact that *did* cause the Moon to break apart, what happened next would depend on the specifics of the impact.  A substantial amount of the kinetic energy of the impact would be translated into heat, and the entire thing would be molten.  If the comet hit the Moon head-on such that their trajectories were in direct opposition, that would cause an overall loss of energy from the system.  Now, the Moon is still ~400,000 km away, so what probably happens is that the remnants settle into a lower orbit.  A sidelong impact or an impact coming up from behind probably adds energy to the system.  Most likely thing I can figure is that for a while, the Earth ends up with a system of rings like Saturn<sq>s, probably with some amount of eccentricity to their orbit.  Assuming an even distribution, which is not necessarily the case, the Sun becomes the dominant factor in the Earth<sq>s tides for a time.  After a much shorter period than you<sq>d expect (though I don<sq>t remember the specific number), the Moon begins to coagulate and re-form itself from the rings.~~<br><br>~~However, you<sq>re asking about a glancing blow from a small comet.  I don<sq>t think that<sq>s gonna cause a global catastrophe on Earth.  For the sort of impact you<sq>re talking about, I<sq>m guessing perhaps a relatively small area of the crust of the Moon becomes molten for a time.  Maybe even some fragments of the comet<sq>s core survive the impact and continue on their way.  Probably it doesn<sq>t affect anything all that much.

If you look at a map you will see that the center line of the National Mall runs exactly East-West.  The camera is close enough to the center line that, for simplicity, it can be assumed to be due East of the Monument.  The sun is therefore setting in the photo.  For six months out of the year, when observed from due East, the setting sun will not even reach the monument.  On the two equinoxes it will set right at the base of the monument.  For a few days after the Spring Equinox and a few days before the Fall Equinox, the sun will <dq>transit<dq> the monument.  During the summer months, the sun will pass over the monument.  The trees in the photo don<sq>t have leaves, so this appears to be some number of days after the Spring Equinox.  Each day after the Equinox the sun will transit the monument a little higher.  The height of the monument is known and the distance from the base of the monument to camera can be estimated.  These two numbers can be used to calculate the angle between the sun and the ground (declination?) in the photo.  Someone knowledgeable with solar tables, I think, could take this angle and look up the date.</p>",

Certainly, Venus won<sq>t be visible both at sunrise and sunset in the day or two after it passes in front of the Sun - the Sun<sq>s brightness just overwhelms.

Some of your terminology is a bit off, but you have the basic idea down.<br><br>The Sun goes through an evolutionary process over an incredibly long period of time. There are numerous sizes of stars, each with their own evolutionary time-scale. Our Sun lies in the middle of the main sequence portion of the H-R diagram, having already gone through *half* of it<sq>s main sequence stage. It will go through the following phases<colon><br><br>* In about *five and a half billion years*, it will enter it<sq>s first red giant phase. At this size, it will be sufficiently large enough to engulf the orbits of the inner planets, including (potentially) Earth.<br><br>*  Over the next *half a billion years*, the Sun will slowly double in size as part of it<sq>s sub-giant phase.<br><br>* Another *half billion years* after that, it expands at a more rapid rate until it is a couple hundred times the size it is today.<br><br>* Now, after ~6.5 billion years, our sun will enter the red giant phase. It will remain a red giant for *another billion years*. Over this time period, it will lose about one third of it<sq>s mass.<br><br>* The Sun, at this point, only has a *hundred million* years of <dq>active<dq> life left. However, things really speed up for it. Hopefully someone else can fill you in on the chain of events in more detail than I can, that take place in this time.<br><br>* *500,000 years* later, I believe, the Sun finally creates a planetary nebula.  <br>A **planetary nebula** occurs when a star ejects it<sq>s outer shell by pulsating. Strong solar winds help to carry the material out from the mass of the star, as the distance from the core provides minimal gravity to hold this material in place. I<sq>d suggest looking it up on Wikipedia for more information. I<sq>m sure there are also decent videos online somewhere you might find. I can<sq>t think of any off the top of my head (plus it is nearly 2 AM where I am, and I<sq>m quite beat).<br><br>* Finally, we near the end of our Sun<sq>s evolution. As the nebula expands further away from the core and disperses, the Sun will go through a massive heat change, then a massive cooling change. It shrinks down to a white dwarf, where it will remain for *billions/trillions of years*, until it finally becomes a black dwarf. No black dwarfs are known to exist, and most likely do not, because the Universe is not sufficiently old enough to carry them.<br><br><br>**Disclaimer**<colon> If you see any errors, please feel free to call me out on them and I will edit this, as this is mostly memory and quick google referencing.

Then the moon (its influence on the tides actually helps with life, quite alot!). And last, but least, we have Jupiter. Without it<sq>s enormous gravity, our solar system would actually be a far more chaotic place. If it starts to move from its current orbit, all hell breaks loose.<br><br>First off, Jupiter is on the other side of the asteroid belt. Once it begins its skydive, it slingshots thousands of asteroids all over the solar system, making it a massive shooting galery. Any asteroids that arent flung out into the solar system are either captured or absorbed by the planet.<br><br>As it draws closer to the Sun, it will cross Mars<sq> orbit.

Mars, unfortunately, would be completely incerated.<br><br>Then, Jupiter finally reaches Earth<sq>s orbit. Again, this depends on the positioning of the planets.

Earthquakes strong enough to bring down mountains, volcanoes going absolutely nuts, wind that makes category 5 hurricanes look like a summer breeze, and tsunamis large enough to block out the Sun. Think Im exaggerating? I might be a little, but everything there is more or less true.<br><br>Then, the inevitable collision. Dont expect much life to be alive at this point, for the Earth itself cant decide if it wants to be a single chunck of rock anymore. Just like Mars, Earth is slowly burnt into a crisp. The area around it is pretty much one massive continuous explosion. Everything on the surface is stripped away. The atmospheric pressure gets higher and higher, and the Earth actually starts to be compressed. Eventually, it hits the (theorized) liquid hydrogen ocean under Jupiter<sq>s atmosphere, and more then likely shatters. All the remaining bits and pieces slowly sink towards the core of the planet, evenrually to be absorbed by it.<br><br>Of course, thats what would happen to Earth. What would happen to the Sun when Jupiter eventually collides is a different story all together.<br><br>By the way, if you think I made this up, think of this. Jupiter is large enough that if you were to merge the other 7 planets together into one planet, Jupiter would still ne bigger then this new planet. Also, Jupiter<sq>s Great Red Spot, the storm that has been chugging along for...well...ever is large enough to swallow the Earth......3 times over. Thats why this collision is so dramatic, because Jupiter is just mind boggingling huge! However, its nothing compared to the Sun!</p>",

Folks come<br>to this forum week after week asking this very question. <dq>Is my scope broken?<dq><br><dq>What am I missing?<dq><br>> <br>> What you<sq>re missing -- is practice.<br>> <br>> First, let<sq>s do a little math to show you what I mean.<br>><br>>Consider the full Moon (when viewed with the naked eye). You can see plenty of<br>interesting features on the Moon with the naked eye -- dark maria, lighter<br>plains. If you try really hard you can possibly make out the radiants from the<br>massive Tycho impact crater. However, you can<sq>t actually see any craters. You<br>don<sq>t see any real surface detail, just <dq>colors<dq> of different <dq>regions<dq> on the<br>><br>>Now you observe the full Moon with a 10x50 binocular. At a modest 10x<br>magnification, now you can see all kinds of stuff! The terminator and limb are<br>ragged with valleys and peaks. You can see hundreds of craters, and possibly<br>even some detail within those craters.<br>><br>>Why are you able to see so much more detail with just a modest 10x<br>magnification? It<sq>s because the features that were invisible before, such as<br>the craters, were less than 1 arcminute in size. Since your retina can<sq>t<br>distinguish between features less than 1 arcminute apart from each other, all<br>the craters and other features were blended together. Applying just 10x<br>magnification meant that features that were just at the limit of observability<br>before, now cover a much more generous 5-10 arcminutes across and are thus now<br>visible as distinct features.<br>><br>>The full moon is 30 arcminutes in diameter. At 10x magnification it appears to<br>be 300 arcminutes in diameter. What would it take to get Jupiter to appear 30<br>arcminutes in diameter? How about 300?<br>><br>>The unmagnified size of Jupiter varies, but for the purposes of this exercise<br>we<sq>ll say it<sq>s 40 arcseconds in diameter. Arcseconds and arcminutes are<br>related the same way regular minutes and seconds are related (there are 60<br>arcseconds in one arcminutes, and 60 arcminutes in one degree). So to get<br>Jupiter to appear 30 arcminutes (1800 arcseconds) wide, you need 1800/40 = 45x<br>magnification. To get it to appear the size of the full Moon in your 10x50<sq>s,<br>you<sq>d need 10x more than that -- 450x magnification.<br>><br>>Let<sq>s do the same math on Mars, which is much smaller. Mars varies in size a<br>lot as it moves across the sky. For this exercise let<sq>s say it<sq>s 15 arcseconds<br>in diameter. To get that 15 arcseconds to appear 1800 arceconds in size (naked<br>eye full Moon size) you need 1800/15 = 120x magnification. To get that <dq>10x<br>binocular<dq> feel, you<sq>d need 10x more than that<colon> 1200x magnification -- probably<br>impossible without a research-grade 50+inch scope and adaptive optics to deal<br>with the atmosphere.<br>><br>But something about this doesn<sq>t feel right -- you look in the eyepiece and<br>even if you can convince yourself that the projected, apparent size of the<br>planet is as big (or in many cases much larger) than that of the full Moon, it<br>doesn<sq>t seem like the level of detail you can see is comparable. The truth is,<br>it<sq>s probably not directly comparable. Remember that the object you<sq>re<br>observing is so tiny it appears as a point of light in the sky. Even the<br>smallest perturbations of the air can affect the light arriving from an entire<br>hemisphere of the planet. So even though its apparent size has been made<br>bigger, the atmosphere is having its way with it as well, degrading the view.<br>You can demonstrate this effect to yourself by observing the Moon. Use a moon<br>atlas to select a crater or other feature that is the same angular size as the<br>planet (hint<colon> it<sq>s going to be one of the very very small ones). Observe that<br>crater at the same magnification that you observe the planet, and try to tease<br>out detail from that crater. Pretty tough, huh? Probably just as tough as<br>trying ot tease out detail from the planet. So it<sq>s not that there<sq>s something<br>especially <dq>hard<dq> or <dq>special<dq> about observing planets -- it<sq>s just that there<br>is a lot working against you.<br>><br>>We now know what the math tells us about what we *should* be able to see at<br>various magnifications. At the modest magnifications required to make planets<br>appear the same apparent size as the naked eye full Moon, you should expect to<br>be able to see surface features on a <dq>macro<dq> scale like you do on the full<br>Moon. You won<sq>t see festoons between the belts on Jupiter, but you will<br>definitely see the belts themselves. You will probably be able to see the<br>great red spot. And on Mars, at 100x+ magnification, you should be able to see<br>the same types of surface features such as dark areas, lighter areas, and even<br>hints of the polar ice caps. With larger scopes that can push more<br>magnification, you can start to pick out more detail, particularly on Jupiter,<br>which grows to an impressive 6.66x the apparent size of the full Moon at 300x<br>magnification, the usual limit due to atmospheric effects.<br>><br>>The last step in your journey of planetary observation is practice. You have<br>to train your eye and mind to pick out detail -- it<sq>s not just going to jump<br>out at you like it does in the Hubble photos. Start by trying to locate<br>specific features, such as the Great Red Spot on Jupiter or the Cassini<br>Division on Saturn. Once you finally see them, you<sq>ll wonder why you couldn<sq>t<br>see them before! The more you learn to see, the more will begin presenting<br>itself to you. That <dq>tiny<dq> little dot, which you now know is actually being<br>presented larger than the full Moon, won<sq>t seem so tiny anymore (it just looks<br>tiny because it<sq>s swimming in an apparent field that is many many times its<br>diameter).<br>><br>>And take your time! If you<sq>re really serious about seeing planetary detail,<br>you<sq>re going to need to spend more than 15-20 seconds at a stretch at the<br>eyepiece. Buy or build an observing chair so you can get your eye carefully<br>positioned in front of the eyepiece, without it shaking around. Just being<br>able to hold your head still for a bit will make it seem like your scope has a<br>couple more inches of aperture. When observing, try to spend at least 60<br>seconds at a stretch in deep concentration on your target. The air is going to<br>blur everything, but every once in a while, the air will stop momentarily --<br>usually for less than a second. During that brief moment, the planet will snap<br>into focus and you<sq>ll see gobs of detail on the surface. Then just as quickly<br>as it snapped into focus, the air will take over again and blur everything.<br>But that<sq>s OK -- that<sq>s just how you deal with the reality of unstable air. If<br>you<sq>re really lucky, you<sq>ll have a night of observing where the upper<br>atmosphere is dead calm. There<sq>s no snapping in and out of focus -- it<sq>s just<br>razor sharp, all night. Those are the truly great nights, and the ones where<br>you can really push your scope to the limit with a 0.5-0.7mm exit pupil.</p>",

I made a video comparison review here<colon> www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkgR_307OEo<br><br>2) Given your budget, you could up your aperture from those two slightly by going with an Orion Skyscanner. That would net you another 24mm in aperture, while still keeping all of the good points about the other scopes.

To simplify the problem, I modelled  is as only sky signal and dark current, and used Poissonian noise from the sky and the dark current (which is not altogether realistic<colon> there is also bias signal/noise and sky background, which I did not include for simplicity).<br><br>After a 2-page derivation (which I can post if anyone cares enough to see it, but it<sq>s pretty messy and I didn<sq>t fully check my work), I came to the following conclusions<colon><br>The ratio of darks to total images (lights plus darks, which I considered fixed in this analysis) depends in a non-linear way on the ratio of the dark current to the sky/object brightness (in a single image).  So I considered the limits of a bright object and a very faint object<colon><br><br>In the case of a bright object (much much brighter than the dark current), the ratio of darks to total images should optimally be equal to the square root of the ratio of dark current (in counts per second per pixel) to object brightness (in counts per second per pixel).<br><br>For a faint object, the <sq>optimum<sq> number of dark frames is 0 (this really surprised me, so I checked my math twice).  Realistically, you want at least one, but otherwise it<sq>s better to spend your precious observing time catching every photon you can.<br><br>This is obviously just a toy model, but I think it has some interesting features.  For faint objects, the lack of signal dominates the S<colon>N, so collecting signal is most important.  For bright objects, signal is going to be strong, so it becomes a matter of minimizing the noise (sky noise plus dark noise).  In between, it becomes non-linear and starts to depend on how many images you<sq>re taking.<br><br><br>The answer the actual question asked, which is<colon> for a fixed number of light images, how many darks to take?  Under the assumptions I considered, the answer would be infinitely many darks, since the more darks you take the less noise is introduced by dark subtraction (assuming the dark current is stable in time).

There are many topics in astronomy that require good CS people. I may be speaking with ignorance of what CS actually entails or what you find most interesting about it. I went for physics and math in my undergrad, and am currently a grad student in astro.<br><br>I would say now is one of the best times to get into astronomy if you enjoy programming and software development. Some of the biggest paradigm shifts in how astronomy are happening currently, and will continue into the foreseeable future. What I mean by this is that astronomy is becoming much more large scale and much more automated. On the pure software side, software sophistication is constantly increasing in terms of data analysis techniques and theoretical computations. Simulating a universe is no small task, and neither is processing all the information we can gather from one. It often requires super computing architecture to accomplish, so understanding that is a huge plus. <br><br>On a more observational front, the amount of data being collected per night is almost insane, and is only increasing. Even smaller projects and all sky surveys are gathering huge amounts of data, and being able to use databases and building them is becoming a big deal. This is not to mention probably one of the biggest data collection projects in the history of astronomy that is coming online relatively soon, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. The amount of data LSST will produce and will need to be reduced, processed, and eventually used is mind boggling. I<sq>ll try and add some links later describing this. <br><br>Although the above two are similar, a different front that requires a large amount of CS knowledge is the instrumentation aspect of astronomy. Being able to program drivers for instruments and devices related to telescopes is always in demand it seems like from my experience, and a lot of people make a name for themselves doing this. Additionally, the robotization of  telescopes is becoming more and more prevalent in smaller observatories. I worked in programming a robotic observatory for the year I took of between my undergrad and grad school. <br><br>Overall, I would not totally exclude the idea of getting into astronomy if I were you. But I would recommend only taking a few introductory courses in astronomy if you have time/find them interesting. I would recommend taking physics classes as much as possible if you want a better background to get into astronomy or physics at a later date, and maybe even consider getting a minor/second major in physics. For your first year, I would probably recommend taking general ed requirements plus a few survey/intro courses in the topics you find most interesting.

Once it had contracted enough to become dense enough and hot enough in the centre for the process of hydrogen fusion to start, the sun would <sq>switch<sq> on.

The star will remain (near enough) the same mass until the last stages of it<sq>s life.<br><br> *It will loose negligible amounts of mass via stellar winds (more when it becomes a [red giant](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant)) and then a significant portion via a [planetary nebular](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) at the end of it<sq>s life*  <br><br>b. Most likely no. The sun is expanding but only by a very small amount at the moment. When hydrogen has run out in it<sq>s core, hydrogen fusion will continue in a shell around the core. The core will collapse further until it is then hot and dense enough for fusion to be triggered between helium nuclei. This will add enough outward pressure along with the hydrogen shell to force the outer layers to expand turning our sun into a red giant.<br><br>The planets formed from the remaining gas orbiting the new sun. The gas condensed into small bodies and coalesced with other small bodies to finally make the planets as we know them. In the early stages of planet formation gas and dust orbiting close to the sun would have lost energy from bumping into more dust and gas and fallen into the sun. By the time bodies would have been big enough to be called a planet this bumping around affect would have stopped so it is unlikely a planet has fallen into the sun. </p>",

True - all galaxies (at least ones that aren<sq>t gravitationally bound to another galaxy) in the universe are moving away from each other, and therefore the *distances* between things are getting larger. However, from my understanding, there<sq>s really nothing being *created* between galaxies.<br><br>For further explanation, it<sq>s important to know exactly what the expansion of the universe is. After the Big Bang (or, more precisely, the [inflationary period](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology\\)) of the universe), everything in the universe was sent speeding off apart from each other (just as you would expect after an explosion). This is really all the expansion of the universe is! The exceptions is that, unlike a typical explosion, this expansion is happening *everywhere* (this stems from the [cosmological principle](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle), which effectively states that there is no center of the universe). A good analogy that I<sq>ve seen is pennies sitting on top of an inflating balloon (ignore the fact that balloons are round) - every penny (representing a galaxy) is getting further away from every other penny and none of the pennies themselves are really moving, and the pennies themselves aren<sq>t getting bigger (since galaxies are gravitationally bound systems).<br><br>Anyway, hopefully that explains things, and feel free to ask any other questions you might have. <colon>)<br><br>Clear skies!</p>",

There are also a myriad of tutorials available online. Astronomers use something much like Latitude and Longitude for celestial coordinates, but they call them Right Ascension (Longitude) and Declination (Latitude). Right Ascension is measured in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds, which will vary in magnitude depending on how far you are from the celestial pole/equator. Declination is measured in Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds, but will have the same magnitude everywhere. There are free star charts that you can view online, or free programs that you can download like Stellarium and Kstars. A really useful tool to use with star charts is a Planisphere which allows you to set the time and date to show you which constellations are up at any given moment. On your phone there are some really good programs that will do the job of both star charts and a Planisphere. I use Sky Safari Plus. Some of the phone apps are sophisticated enough to guide a computerized telescope. It is hard to beat a good set of star charts though. I like Sky Atlas 2000. There used to be a couple of more detailed sets, but the advent of computerized charts seems to have kept them out of print for a while. Uranometria was an awesome set of charts, but for less money you can get a computer program with tons more data. You may want to poke around the Sky & Telescope website, they have some pretty good resources and links for beginners. Also, see if you can find a local astronomy club and go observing with them. There is no better way to learn than by doing, especially if you have knowledgeable people around to ask the questions that come up as they come up. One thing to remember about star charts is that they represent you looking up at the sky instead of down at the ground like regular maps. Consequently, East and West are reversed from what you are used to; right is west (assuming north is up).<br><br>http<colon>//www.skyandtelescope.com/</p>",

People around the world have been reporting seeing meteors and fireballs for days now.  This will continue up to and well past the peak night.  If the night skies are clear, go out and look over the next 10 days.  You will be likely to see most on the peak night, but plenty on the other nights too.  You should see more as we approach the peak and less after it, but that will be still quite a lot over the course of a few nights.  There is a lot of focus on the peak night, but it isn<sq>t the only night of the Perseids, so go and look whenever you can.  It is not as some people think, that the skies are suddenly filled with meteors for a few minutes and then it all disappears again.  It is a far longer and slower process than that.  The skies may not even be clear for you on the peak night, so look on any clear night around now.  The peak night is the night you would expect to see most, but you will see plenty on other nights too, so go out and look as often as you can and don<sq>t worry about when the peak actually is.</p>",
