That means so many different things to so many different people that it causes problems...<dq>cables<dq> is cool though.<br><br>There<sq>s a bit of some back story I<sq>m going to have to go through, so try to stay with me--I promise it<sq>ll be worth it.  I<sq>m going to have to go through a couple things so that I can explain things better.  Those are going to be<colon><br><br>* The OSI Physical Layer<br>* Shared Access Mediums<br>* What a Modem is and isn<sq>t<br>* Bands, channels, and bandwidth<br>* Multiplexing<br>* And finally, **how it all works together.** AKA, the Fun Stuff.<br><br>> I<sq>m just asking about physical cables.<br><br>I know.  It<sq>s complicated.  Let<sq>s take a walk.  I<sq>m going to hit you with a bunch of theory and then tie it all together with some real-world stuff.<br><br>----<br><br># The Physical Layer #<br><br>Ok, let<sq>s start with a couple of things.  In communication, there<sq>s a model called the [OSI Layer Model](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), which basically is a conceptual division of the separation of functions involved in communication.<br><br>You see, not too long ago, every hardware engineer realized that if they had to implement, from scratch, every single communication protocol in every device, that it would be an impossible task to maintain.  So they broke up the functional nature of communication.  If you know anything even remotely technical about the internet, you<sq>ll have heard of TCP/IP, which fits into the OSI model, however TCP/IP was out before the OSI model had been developed and it fits into there quite horribly in some ways.  Still, you can see the layering in there.<br><br>At the bottom of this model is what<sq>s called the Physical Layer, which is basically where the magic starts to happen--and is, for the most part, the most complicated.  Different physical mediums have different advantages, challenges, drawbacks, exploitable characteristics, etc.  There are standards bodies such as [IEEE](http<colon>//ieee.org) and [TIA/EIA](http<colon>//www.tiaonline.org) that sit down and cook up the standards for how to transmit data on any given physical medium.  There<sq>s no magic behind Wifi or DSL, or any of that.  A bunch of engineers sat down, wrote up a standard, and said, <dq>here, if you want to make cable modems, this is how it has to behave.<dq>  Ever heard of 802.11 (Wifi)?  That<sq>s an IEEE standard.<br><br>The reason I<sq>m running this all down is just to say this<colon> It<sq>s the physical layer<sq>s job to get a stream of bits from one computers memory into another computers memory.  There<sq>s a better explanation than that, but that one works and is the least complicated.  From there, you start going up the model.  It<sq>s beyond this explanation how the whole model works, but the next step up is called the data-link layer, which is essentially where <dq>ok, the physical layer got a series of bits into my memory, what do they mean? What does the first 8 bits mean?  The next 16?<dq>  Up from there is the Network layer, which is where <dq>Packets<dq> come into existence (see, I told you).<br><br>So at the end of the day, essentially any physical medium that you can conceivably transmit data on can be layered into a communications channel--and in fact is.  From traditional telephone lines to coaxial television cables to radio frequencies to power transmission lines to highly precisely manufactured Ethernet cables to fiber optics... each is a physical medium that can be used to transmit data.  Some are more complicated than others.<br><br>----<br>#Ok, so why<sq>d I go through all that trouble explaining the physical layer?#<br><br>The physical layer is where the magic happens, and can be quite complicated depending on the medium.  Fiber optics?  You<sq>re blinking a laser on and off really quickly.  Cable modem--now that shit<sq>s complicated, but I<sq>ll explain it.<br><br>But here<sq>s the real reason why.  If you run a physical wire between two computers, it<sq>s obviously rather simple to send bits back and forth.  You can do it with a single wire, and decide what voltage is a `1` and what voltage is a `0`, and how quickly they will be sent, and you have a communications channel.  But it<sq>s impractical (in fact, impossible) to run a physical connection between every pair of computers on the internet.  The flip side of that is called a <dq>shared medium<dq>, meaning one where you<sq>re not the only sender/recipient.  Shared mediums allow cable companies to reach thousands of people with just a few physical cables in the ground.  They allow mobile telephone operators to serve millions of people with just a handful of radio towers.  They allow your sister to watch netflix why you ~~try yet in vain for another decade to find pictures of Keri Russell naked~~ do your homework.<br><br>Shared mediums is where it<sq>s at, but, as your questions bring up, this is a complicated subject.  So let<sq>s get started<colon><br><br>> Is it like a signal for a processor where there<sq>s a threshold, like 3.3V (just an example) that causes a gate to close?<br><br>We<sq>re going to drop the word <dq>signal<dq> from our vocabulary for a little bit.  You don<sq>t know what it means--which is fine, because nobody can agree on what it exactly means, which is why nobody uses it as a bare word like that.<br><br>In a processor--or any other hardware for that matter--you have a physical layer and a protocol to follow.  If you want to design a Digital Canooter Valve, you go buy a Canooter Valve controller chip, read up on which pin does what and how you tell it to do what you want it to do (physical protocol), and... do it.<br><br>So yes, it<sq>s like <dq>a threshold that causes a gate to close<dq>, which is a 1-wire serial communication channel, but it<sq>s also not like that in many cases.  That<sq>s just one physical medium, and one physical protocol.<br><br>While we<sq>re taking a small break, let me answer a couple things and clear up a few others.<br><br>> These packets contain identifying information for whatever device is looking for it, like an IP address, domain name to find, or whatever.<br><br>Ok, you<sq>re getting WAY ahead of yourself though.  Remember that OSI model?  We<sq>ve gotten to layer 2.  You<sq>re talking about Layer 7.  We<sq>ll get there.<br><br>> I<sq>m guessing that these requests and packets of information have to be turned into bits somehow.<br><br>Yep, and now you know how--kind of.  I<sq>ll get into the (some) of the rest of the OSI model at the end so you understand it better.  But once you have a stream of bits, now you have to put it on the wire (or the air), and that<sq>s the physical layer<sq>s job.<br><br>----<br>#Shared Access Mediums#<br><br>So now we have a rough idea of what a transmission medium is.  What OP is asking about is what<sq>s called a <dq>shared access<dq> medium.  That<sq>s any transmission medium where there are more than one sender and/or recipient.<br><br>So, starting to get to the first couple of OP<sq>s questions, yes, every shared access medium has to handle the the problem of whose data is whose, when who can transmit and when who can<sq>t, what happens when two senders talk over each other, etc, etc.  This is a HUGE subject--rooms full of books have been written on it, but I<sq>ll touch on just a couple here before getting into Modems and then putting it all together.<br><br>But essentially, when you<sq>re dealing with shared access media, you have to deal with how to separate traffic in a meaningful way so that everybody gets a reasonably fair share, and how to deal with the situations where there might be some confusion about things.  **This is the point I want to make here<colon> A bunch of engineers sat down and decided what the answers were going to be to all of your questions ahead of time because you have all of those same problems on every shared medium.**<br><br>So, as an example, the original version of Ethernet was essentially a bunch of computers clamped onto what essentially amounted to radio antenna cable.  So remember those IEEE guys?  Yeah, they designed all this next stuff<colon>  Any station could start transmitting at any time, provided no other station was transmitting.  There is a mechanism to deal with two stations talking over each other in the event that two stations started transmitting at the same time (called a collision) where one station could signal the other station (or a third could do it) that the two were transmitting over each other.  Each station would stop transmitting and pick a random amount of time to delay before re-attempting the transmission and, with any luck, you got through on the second try.  Yes, everybody got a copy of everybody else<sq>s traffic.  As you can see, this only scales so well, but that<sq>s how that worked.  Most of this technology is still in use today although in practice, collisions over wired ethernet are a thing of the past (but still very real over wifi) and the rest is at MUCH higher speeds.<br><br>#STAY TUNED FOR MORE#<br></p>",

First, your senior execs will see you<sq>re not likely to make your next quarter<sq>s numbers and the forecast isn<sq>t better beyond that. They<sq>ll make a decision to basically prepare for a layoff. Accountants start running numbers. There<sq>s always a big up-front cost of laying people off in severance pay, at least with professional office type positions where people are seldom <dq>laid off<dq> as much as <dq>let go<dq> and aren<sq>t going to get a call-back in a few months if things turn around.<br><br>The first step from the engineering org<sq>s standpoint is that all of the managers and directors will get a request from HR and their bosses to force rank their employees. You<sq>ll often be asked to rank them in a couple ways. By performance, by potential, by criticality of their assignments. These may be weighted and combined, and at some point you have a final list. Every employee in your group ranked from highest to lowest. The weighting is probably 80+<percent> based on performance in my experience. I as a manager may be in on a calibration meeting with my boss to combine my list with the other managers, I may not and he may do it himself. Either way, every budgeting org or group will have a combined list. <br><br>The GM<sq>s, VP<sq>s, and other senior executives will at some point make a decision about what percentage of the headcount needs to be let go. Usually these things need CEO approval, maybe even Board of Directors approval. From my understanding often they<sq>ll give a general approval and leave the finer details to the people closer to each business. Most companies won<sq>t do a layoff for less than 8-10<percent> of headcount unless they<sq>re really big. They<sq>ll instead cancel any open reqs, cancel travel, cease 401k matching, force everyone to take an unpaid week off, or get much more strict on low-performers.  <br><br>So the decision to lay people off is made and a target dollar amount of monthly salary or a percentage of the workforce is decided upon. Next the senior execs balance those numbers from department to department. Typically R&D will get a bit lighter pass than manufacturing and manufacturing support roles. If you<sq>re not making stuff you don<sq>t need people in manufacturing roles. Of course, if they decide to cancel an entire project or program R&D could be hit harder. So maybe the company decides to shed 10<percent> of total headcount, and there<sq>s a percentage by group. Accounting will shed 10<percent>, IT 12<percent>, Marketing  8<percent>, Purchasing 10<percent>, R&D 8<percent>, Operations 15<percent>, etc. These numbers tend to be tentative until the very last days and they<sq>ll have a few scenarios. <br><br>Before you find out as a manager who<sq>s actually going to be laid off, HR and Legal will review the lists. They<sq>ll make sure that your forced ranking didn<sq>t single out the women in the department, the minorities, the near-retirees, etc. In a few rare cases I<sq>ve seen people who should have been in the bottom list kept because they fit into a protected group or were considered likely to sue.

If you<sq>re getting to a <dq>real<dq> layoff the contractors are probably already gone. The next group to go is everyone on a PIP (performance improvement plan) or who was on one in the last year.

You<sq>ve done the work to prove your company is endangering the public and you NEED to let them know you<sq>re not going to stop unless something is done. Unfortunately, you will probably face resistance from the company and they may turn hostile, looking for any way they can to fire you but you must stay strong and proceed. Like you said, people<sq>s lives are on the line here.<br><br>Starting with your direct manager, approach them with your evidence (I know you<sq>ve done this, but it<sq>s a different request this time) and tell them as bluntly as possible that what you<sq>ve been asked to do is endangering the public and has ethic and legal implications for you. The key here is to make it know you<sq>re willing to escalate this issue as high up as possible until it is addressed. Don<sq>t whistle blow right off the bat because you still want to have a career in the future.<br><br>If your manager brushes you aside, which it sounds like was done in the past, but you still must approach them again because of the change in message you<sq>re delivering (document, time, date, and what you said) move up a level. Tell this person the same thing, but add on that you<sq>ve already talked to your manager and you were pushed aside, but this is not something you will ignore because of its implications. <br><br>Proceed with this tactic all the way up to the CEO, yes the CEO. It doesn<sq>t matter you<sq>re a junior engineer, people<sq>s lives are on the line, and you need to do what<sq>s necessary. In fact, this may even add gravitas to your argument because if a junior engineer is coming to see them and violating the chain of command, it must be serious. Let the CEO know the exact same thing. You<sq>ve done the work and consulted everyone below him/her but nobody is listening. This isn<sq>t a subjective decision, but rather an objective fundamental engineering issue that is endangering the lives of people and you<sq>re willing to do whatever<sq>s necessary to address the problem. Usually, if it gets to this point something will be done. The last thing the CEO wants is a huge issue like this to becoming public and ruining the company. They<sq>ll step in and make a change, regardless of the economic impact. Tell them if no change is made, you have an ethical and legal obligation to pursue this matter further because of its impact.<br><br>Regardless of whether something is done or not, I think you need to hand in your resignation at this point, and make it extremely clear at your exit interview (ask for one if they don<sq>t do it by default) that you<sq>re leaving because the company is engaging in illegal practises. This covers your ass as well as eliminates all ambiguity surrounding the issue, and puts the final onus back on company.  If nothing was resolved, approach your regulatory engineering body because while they mostly deal with disciplining individual engineers they may point you to the right person. This will usually be someone at a governmental office. <br><br>Do not approach the media to whistle blow until you<sq>ve done these steps because your goal should be to solve the issue, not publicly shame the company. Then when you<sq>re interviewing for other jobs and the issue comes up, be completely honest about why you left. Most companies will be understanding that asking your engineer to do something illegal is illegal in an of itself.<br><br>If you have any questions or if something isn<sq>t too clear, feel free to ask.

I majored in Biological Systems Engineering and got a Master<sq>s in Environmental and Water Resource Engineering so I know a bit of both worlds, so here<sq>s a simplified analogy<colon><br><br>Water and wastewater treatment plants are similar, though it sounds like you are talking about a water treatment plant. In your common plants you have your intake-> screening-> flocculation and sedimentation-> filtering-> chlorination -> distribution.<br><br>This is for conventional freshwater treatment. Desalination is a whole other animal where you have to pre-treat the water with (more commonly) reverse osmosis or electrodialysis. RO uses pressure to push water through a semipermeable membrane, overcoming osmotic pressure. Suffice it to say it<sq>s not simple filtering.<br><br>So if you treat one human body as a scaled-down, analogous version of a treatment plant, the mouth and esophagus would be your intake lines. The teeth could serve as pre-screening bar screens to remove large items from entering. Your stomach and small intestine could then serve as the sedimentation basin where solids are allowed to settle out. The liver would act like sand filters, removing smaller particles that weren<sq>t removed by the screens (teeth) or sedimentation basin (stomach). Once you have your clean water, you can now add disinfectants like chlorine, similar to the way the pancreas adds digestive enzymes to complete digestion. And just like that, the water is ready for distribution.<br><br>I didn<sq>t go over the desalination process because our body doesn<sq>t handle saltwater so well. You would need another process or sink for it. I suppose if you used tongues as a sink, that might be analogous to electrodialysis in attracting the salt ions. Another detail is that the body does not disinfect water. It doesn<sq>t add chlorine or use UV light to disinfect like a normal plant would. So there<sq>s those limitations. In the end, with hearts serving as pumps, you could push the water out for distribution. Just make sure to include backflow prevention valves (like we have in our *veins*) so the water doesn<sq>t flow in reverse. Scale all this up with multiple body parts, and baby you got yourself a stew.<br><br>Edit<colon> Backflow prevention valves are found in our veins.<br><br>Edit 2<colon> I<sq>m more knowledgeable about water treatment and engineering than microbiology and physiology.

Basically you have a <dq>game<dq> played with each side having a turn with 3 options<colon><br><br>* Stay in the game, accept offered bid, game ends<br>* Stay in the game, make counter-bid (including a null-bid, same-as-last-time), game continues<br>* Get out of the game (walk away), game ends<br><br>This is bootstrapped by a opening bid made by one of the two sides.  The game iterates until the game ends.  BTW ALL economic transactions and romantic/sexual relationships are also negotiations exactly the same as this.  Something to think about if you aren<sq>t getting laid regularly or if you are in a bad relationship.<br><br>All you have to do is know what you are willing to accept, counter or walk from.  These are determined by stakes (pay, benefits, commitments, etc.) and resource levels (your time to play the game and money opportunity cost of playing).  You should always enter any negotiation knowing what these thresholds are ahead of time.  <br><br>You can determine the thresholds based on <br><br>1. comparables (what others that are <dq>comparable<dq> are paid) - like how houses are initially bid, or<br><br>2. your own financial needs (cost-based pricing, your cash flow costs and obligations) which usually <dq>leaves money on the table<dq> in their favor<br><br>3. your intuition and opinion of what you are worth and what you think they will accept (<dq>what the market will bear<dq> which is not <dq>provable<dq> except empirically but is just as reasonable as anything for a negotiation - you have to be brave enough to be able to <dq>walk<dq> based on your intuition/opinion about this) - this is actually the maximizing solution and also the one that requires the most knowledge/research and risk.<br><br>The party *offering money* (aka Buyer) should always *low-ball* their initial offer and counter-offers.  The party *offering non-money* (aka Seller) should always *high-ball* their initial offer and counter-offers.

This actually both signals, and is in fact an indication of, a side<sq>s situational/negotiation weakness.  Aka <dq>Blood in the water<dq>.  You have time (unless you don<sq>t) so having several iterations of the above game is a good thing.  <br><br>In other words, your 1st counter offer *should be obviously unacceptable* with the expectation it will be rejected **and trigger a counter-offer but not a <dq>walk away<dq>** on their side<colon> above the Buyer<sq>s <dq>Reasonable Zone<dq> but below the Buyer<sq>s <dq>Insult Zone<dq> in the Buyer<sq>s <dq>Credible Zone<dq> (see PDF below).  The <dq>Insult Zone<dq> is where a side is jarred to the point where they realize they are wasting their time playing the game and should walk away (quit).<br><br>And the $66K should be obviously unacceptable to you - nearly in if not in your <dq>Insult Zone<dq>.  I<sq>d say $80K is still in the Buyer<sq>s Credible Zone, possibly in the high Reasonable Zone.  I<sq>d guess the $66k is actually the Buyer<sq>s <dq>Top Line<dq> offer.<br><br>So you iterate with their offer to your counter offer (and assuming they reject $80K)<colon> <br><br>---<br><br><dq>So you won<sq>t do $80K.

I also have a very good, above *average* GPA.<dq><br><br>*lay your resume on the table*  <br><br><dq>So I while my $80K number is quite fair IMO, what can you do instead?<dq><br><br>And they counter-counter-offer with a new number (the game continues, now with them having the idea that your <dq>Bottom Line<dq> is closer to $72,500) or they <dq>null<dq> counter offer (<dq>we can<sq>t go above $66K<dq>).  Again, what is **your** <dq>walk away<dq> threshold?  I<sq>d definitely walk at this point unless there are significant non-money things they can counter with, but that<sq>s me.<br><br>So consider asking/proposing for things that aren<sq>t cash money to pad you initial or counter offers (especially if they null offer below your walk away threshold).

They want to be liked because you just said you liked them BUT - you put the BUT in their mouths based on what they said/offered which says they are not reciprocating with your liking them.  You may pick up on it in body language.  Being put on the defense will cause them to agree to things they may not normally agree or plan to; that<sq>s a good thing.

I<sq>d be willing to pick up the expenses for my wife other than the hotel, transportation and meals, of course.<dq><br><br>*Obviously you need to be prepared for all of this with your own numbers. It<sq>s like studying for an exam you<sq>d actually like to pass, right?  Did you notice the sleight-of-hand on getting your wife/SO covered?  Of course the <dq>extra expense<dq> both quite reasonable and costing you nothing but it only seems fair to include the other things for her since she is affected by their offer gap also and they need to make up the gap in their offer somehow.*<br><br><dq>And to really do my job here well, I<sq>d really need to have the new Acme Boundary-layer Characterization System 5000 in my lab and plenty of computing power to drive the analysis.  If you could provide that I have one of those, say, within the next 2-3 months, and give me a $200K/year capital budget, I could ignore the remaining difference in salary from what I think is perfectly reason and acceptable as an industry norm.<dq><br><br>*Get this in writing also.  And the benefit to them is that they get to keep the Acme 5000 and any capital anyway and it help them with a productivity issue.  So it doesn<sq>t actually cost them and might be nearly a sunk cost anyway.

But sometimes this doesn<sq>t work 100<percent>.  A better algorithm discovered ?2013? is to also monitor the driver directly behind your car, and to use your empty gap to speed up whenever the car behind you is approaching too fast.  This tends to damp any large fluctuations commonly produced by an inattentive driver directly behind.  Don<sq>t be like a solid wall, instead be like a dashpot.  Perform this trick at the same time as the known task of absorbing the waves coming from ahead.<br><br>An older technique (long known to professional truckers) is to never close up your gap, never try to <dq>block cheaters<dq> or <dq>punish interlopers<dq> or any of that stuff.    Instead, always encourage free merging.  Try to get people to jump into the gap ahead of you.  And, if a huge backup appears in one lane, the proper thing to do is to use the empty lane, and to merge in one place only<colon> at the last minute.  (Or, if you must merge early, then maintain a large gap in the through-lane, making late-merging possible.)  Traffic often behaves like merging gear-teeth, and to keep the gears spinning requires empty spaces.  The modern term for this is <dq>do the zipper.<dq>   Several state DOTs have started publicity campaigns about Zipper Merging.<br><br>Here<sq>s another from traffic physics<colon>  the optimum algorithms for highway driving are very different than those for in-city driving where traffic lights are present.  For example, when we<sq>re down in the city-grid, if we maintain large gaps, then the next red light will block our progress.  Or worse, we<sq>ll be pushing a whole column of traffic back into a red light; traffic which could have made it through.   In the city-grid, a certain amount of tailgating is required, and big gaps may greatly reduce the flow.   But on highways without red lights, it all works backwards.   Without the traffic signals to pace the flow, large jams can spontaneously arise from nothing.  The jams require an environment of aggressive tailgating before they can form.  These jams can be partially thwarted by <dq>anti-tailgaters,<dq> by drivers who maintain large forward gaps, and who drive at constant speed in order to prevent fluctuations from growing.   Also, the large gaps will promote <dq>zipper<dq> or <dq>gear teeth<dq> rapid driving through merge-zones.<br><br>A less cutting-edge driving technique involves psychology.  Observe congested traffic accurately, and eliminate all the myths and emotional bias which distorts our perceptions as drivers.  A big one is this<colon>  each car on the road is actually a delay of only 1-2 seconds.  It<sq>s nothing like a line at the grocery cash register.  If a car merges into your gap, will you be late to work?  What if ten cars jump in ahead of you, *O the Humanity!*  <colon>)    Nope, even if 60 cars get ahead, that only delays you by a minute or two.  Such a small a delay is insignificant for most commutes.  It<sq>s down in the noise, a tiny fluctuation.  Compared to a line at the grocery checkout, one shopping cart equals 50 to 200 cars ahead of you on the highway.  But it doesn<sq>t *feel* that way!   We all seem to be trapped in a delusional time-warp during commutes.<br><br>If we aggressively pass three other cars during congestion, it *feels* as if we<sq>re shortening our commute-time.  Wrong, because if we want to genuinely shorten our commute, we<sq>d have to drive a few MPH faster than average.  Our position in line means nothing, when compared to actually driving faster.  For example, on a half-hour commute, if we could drive 2MPH faster than everyone else, we<sq>d have passed *an entire mile* worth of cars in the chain.   So, if you fight like fury and manage to pass ten other drivers, twenty other drivers  ...that<sq>s nothing.  Instead you could have set your alarm clock 1min earlier in the morning, which puts you ahead by roughly sixty cars.  <br><br>Or, here<sq>s another way to view this<colon>  if you walk onto the subway, or on a bus, should you try rushing to the front?  Elbow everyone aside, knock down kids and old ladies?   After all, each passenger ahead of you at the bus door might cause an *entire second* of delay.  Yet when riding on the bus, there<sq>s no delusional time-warp.  We don<sq>t usually have several other passengers viciously fighting for the seat closest to the front.  If someone ever does shoulder their way to the front of the vehicle while crowing about how skilled and superior they are at bus-riding, the driver will stop the bus and call for the men in white coats!   So<colon> if you wouldn<sq>t do it on the bus, don<sq>t do it while highway commuting.   When you<sq>re in rush hour, you<sq>re not in a road race.  Instead, admit to the fact that you<sq>re <dq>trapped on a bus,<dq> and if you take your seat and stop fighting with other commuters, then like magic the whole bus goes much faster.<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>Yes, there is a final single file with all 8 billion transistors on it that is sent to the fab.  The file can be many gigabytes large, and has the extension .gds.  This gds file contains the coordinates for all of the different metal layers, polysilicon layers, nitrite layers, diffusion layers, etc to build the actual transistors.<br><br>The design of modern processors is actually quite interesting.  With so many transistors on a modern chip, the whole processes has been abstracted to coding.  Basically if you can code, you can design a full computer processor.  You do not need any electrical knowledge.  The process is called [VLSI Design](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-large-scale_integration) and it works as follows<colon><br><br>1. You discribe the functionality of whatever you want the chip to do in a high level hardware discription language, such as [Verilog](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog).  Verilog is just like any other programming language, so you can program in algorithms, state machines, whatever you want.  Now you can test and simulate your design with programs such as [NC-Verilog](http<colon>//www.ece.ncsu.edu/muse/courses/ece406/labs/guitut/GUITutorial.pdf).<br>2. Once you are happy with the design you have to turn it into hardware.  This step is called [synthesis](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_synthesis).  Someone else (usually the foundry) designs electrical circuits to do boolean logic operations for you.  So the foundry will provide you with a hardware adder, and gate, or gate, etc.  This is called a [standard cell library.](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_cell)  Now, you use a computer program such as [RTL Compilier](http<colon>//www.ece.virginia.edu/~mrs8n/cadence/Synthesis_Tutorial/rc_tutorial.html), which will read in your verilog code, and compile a netlist of and and or gates with the same logic functionality.  The output of the program is usually another verilog file containing only the boolean standard cells which perform the same logic functionality.  It will also output report files saying what cells it used, and will estimate power, speed and area of the design.<br>3. Now that you have a standard cell library to use, and your synthesised verilog, the next step is to combine the two.  This step is called [Place and Route (PnR)](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_and_route).  Basically a computer program will read in your sythensised verilog, and place in the standard cells according to what your synthesised verilog says.  The defacto tool for PnR is called [Encounter](http<colon>//cecs.wright.edu/~emmert/tutorials/Cadence_First_Encounter.pdf).  The output of encounter will be a finished chip.  It will output a final gds file containing every transistor on the chip, a final PnR verilog which you can use to simulate the chip with, a schematic in [spice](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE) format, which you can simulate with, and report files, which will estimate area, power, and speed of the completed chip.<br>4. Once you have the final gds file, you must verify it works before sending it to be fabricated.  The gds file can be checked with a general purpose electrical CAD software, such as [Cadence Virtuoso](http<colon>//www.ee.virginia.edu/~mrs8n/cadence/tutorial1.html).  In Virtuoso you can to make sure it passes all the design rules with [DRC rule ](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rule_checking) checks.  And you also wanna check that the final spice netlist matches the gds layout with [LVS checks](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layout_Versus_Schematic).  Also, you want to run a full electrical simulation on the schematic that encounter outputed to you.  This will give you actual power number, and delay numbers for your design.  Two big tools for performing these simulations are [Synopsys Primetime](http<colon>//www.csl.cornell.edu/courses/ece5745/handouts/ece5745-tut5-pt.pdf) and [Synopsys Nanosim](http<colon>//www.utdallas.edu/~poras/courses/ee6325/lab/nanosim/).<br>5.  Once you are happy with the results you send you completed gds file to the fab, and wait 6 months or so until the chip gets fabbed.<br><br>Notes in the Margin<colon><br><br>*I use alot of these tools any day, so feel free to ask me anything about them<br><br>*These tools are all REALLY REALLY REALLY expensive, and can cost $10,000s a year for the licence fee for any single tool listed above.  So companies spend millions of dollars just on the licence fees for the programs they use to build computer chips.<br><br>*The documentation for most of these tools are either crap, or non-existent.  And if you email the company to ask how to do something, they ignore you, or answer your question wrong.  And, no there are no free alternatives to most of these tools.<br><br>*Because these tools are really really expensive, and very very hard to use, if you know how to use any of the tools, you are very very valuable, and will be paid very very well.<br><br>*All of these tools are linux based, not windows, so Yay linux.<br><br>*Alot of the tools are command line based, and you use with scripting languages such as TCL, perl, python, ruby, etc.<br><br>*Each simulation can take hours/days to complete.

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>ve put a lot of thought into this since I was kid, but first I want to ask which John Hammond are we referencing here, the book version or the movie version? There were actually a TON of detailed, relatively smart precautions taken in the book that never (or barely) made it to the silver screen, such as<colon><br><br>- **Motion sensors and video surveillance equipment cover 92<percent> of the park**, all feeding a computer database that keeps visual tabs on the animals, ensuring specified numbers are maintained (they never programmed it recognize an *increase* in population, which they failed to realize until it was much too late)<br><br>- As the group is inspecting the island, they notice that the island is separated into 6 divisions, each division surrounded by electrified fences and roads. But what is *unique* here is that the roads are separated from the fences by **concrete moats**, some designated on the map as being up **30 ft wide**! Sally even comments at one point that is on the order of a military fortification! Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson<sq>s character in the movie) later explains that they are **never less than 12 feet deep**, and even **up to 30 ft deep** for the larger critters, **all filled with water**.<br><br>- It is noted that *all* of the buildings (not just some) are constructed of **very thick concrete and very small windows**, making many of them look like [Nazi Pillboxes](https<colon>//www.google.com/search?q=nazi+pillbox&hl=en&biw=1686&bih=840&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIzLP9iJmWxgIVQiqICh2g4gzF)<br><br>- Fifty miles of 12 foot high fencing, carrying **10,000 volts**<br><br>- An aviary was constructed, comprised of geodesic struts that were assumed to be made of aluminum and mesh in the open spaces. Grant figures the **diameter is at least a quarter mile**<br><br>- A **lysine contingency** was bio-engineered into the creatures, so that if they stopped receiving regular doses of it through their daily meals, they would go into  a coma and die within 12 hours (as Malcolm puts it, however<colon> [<dq>Life, uh, finds a way.<dq>](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMjQ3hA9mEA))<br><br>- Everything else featured in the movies is relatively accurate, the one thing they left out is that Costa Rica finally says enough is enough [Spoiler](#s <dq>and literally carpet bombs the island into oblivion after airlifting the survivors away<dq>).<br><br>**So, what would I do differently?**<br><br>- First and foremost, 12 ft high electrified fences aren<sq>t going to do jack with intelligent creatures (this reminds me of deer fences, and I have actually seen deer jump them before). If anything, they should be tertiary at best. If you have to use the fences, **triple them in height and make more than one layer of defense**. I really don<sq>t see the moats as much use, so use something like an open pit that drops straight down 100 ft or more, or elevating the roadways up 60 ft high or more, made of concrete, that can act as yet another wall system.<br><br>- **I would NOT mess around with the security situation whatsoever.** If Hammond mentioned to me, <dq>We spare no expense!<dq>, ohhhhh how he would regret those words. First, there would be a **minimum of three different, independent computer systems** that helped control the core functions of the park. Gotta have fail safes. ~~Second, I would instruct him to invest in nuclear power facilities (fortified to nuts, obviously) that also could be designed to have fail safes to act as small nuclear weapons, in a worst case scenario~~ (forgot that *Lost World* reveals InGen utilized geothermal plants on the islands, also it<sq>s pointed out below why the contingency plan is a piss poor idea). Lastly, each sector would have it<sq>s own set of 2-3 platoons (or even company<sq>s, in the case of the large animal areas) of tactical teams, housed in barracks that were fortified to the nuts. This would allow for quick response teams to be available to each sector with available nearby support, and a system of check-ins would be implemented within each sector to ensure each team was present and accounted for on a regular basis (I would essentially treat the island as damned military occupation, NOT a damned joyride). Each team would be equipped with the latest and greatest military-grade tech that would let them take out a damned aircraft carrier if they needed to.<br><br>- I would make the island one of the top consumers of titanium, and a close second of high yield strength composites.<br><br>- Vehicles that were designed with triple redundant backup systems. A smaller airlift squadron would also be constructed on the island.<br><br>- Emergency protocols would be beefed wayyyy up. Multiple redundant supply trains would be established (sea, air) to ensure multiple possible escape routes. Also, local government agencies would NOT be left in the dark to wonder what the hell was going on until the last minute. IN FACT, emergency military operations would be established in conjunction with islands own force protection.<br><br>- A lot of other people have already mentioned some great ideas, so I<sq>m not going to steal their thunder, but I agree with the majority of them.<br><br>Call me paranoid, but I do not like to see a situation like Jurassic Park as it was originally conveyed to be treated by Hammond as his second attempt at a flea circus for kids. These are dangerous creatures with unknown behavioral patterns, and it would serve to err on the right side of caution!<br><br>EDIT<colon> Just remembered that whoever thought using amphibian DNA in the dinosaur genome project ought to be shot. Hire biologists and bioengineers that can actually remember, <dq>Oh, hey, this species has a history of being able to change it<sq>s sex at will.

Their collective perspective is Tesla will be bigger than Toyota, because they will make cars CHEAPER than Toyota... That is all their is to it. It has and always will be about volume. Elon makes noise (I<sq>m sure he wants to be the next Rockefeller) about selling batteries to the whole world (trains, planes, laptops, home storage, etc.), which is what he means by $1Trillion. Most of the automotive industry believes Tesla could, with several models, (say 6 cars, and equivilent sales) be as big as one of the German luxury car companies... however they are a LONG ways from Toyota or Ford selling 1 million quantity each of the Focus or Corolla as single products, and, as such, are 10x less valuable.  <br><br>Efficiency is ONE variable. Many engineers and physics majors will design you a $1 Million dollar car that uses basically $0 worth of fuel... yay?... yet if I can make energy for very low cost, efficiency doesn<sq>t matter. So we<sq>re looking at cost deltas... Now we know what Hydrogen costs now, and we know what Lithium costs now... so although the answer to your question is 20 years out... What we can do now is look at the current material delta of two identical cars<colon><br><br>1. H2<colon> Cheap-Cost Chemical Catalyst, and expensive fuel. > To become cheaper.<br><br>2. Li<colon> Expensive Chemical Battery and cheap fuel. > To become cheaper.<br><br>They aren<sq>t too different.<br><br>Both require infrastructure, and I<sq>m not sure anyone on earth could successfully argue that Li infra will be cheaper to roll out than piping... but more importantly, that piping does NOT need to go to every home, just to every gas station... and there are VERY VERY few of those compared to homes, so the amortized cost is marginal, in fact probably on par with the amortized cost of batteries. Let<sq>s look at Hydrogen argument<colon><br><br>* The reason Japan as a whole is doubling down on H2, is that splitting ocean water with nuclear power makes a lot of sense... and hydrogen could be fractionally expensive. <br><br>* The reason American car companies believe H2 is good, is that grid storage potential requirement will be, as a rough example, New York City will need a carbon-free 1 month supply of electricity, stored for backup use.<br><br>So we<sq>re adding nuclear electricity with H2 via Ti catalyst splitting, at tiny cost (bad efficiency, however its carbon free and low cost), to the fact we<sq>ll have larger-scale nuclear desalination anyways... to the fact that we<sq>ll need gigawatts of energy storage for America, and you have a situation where sheer hydrogen volume will drive the price of H2 down to a perhaps 10 cents per gallon equivalent. <br><br>Now Lithium<colon> Li batteries however, will also come down a huge amount... I know lots of people in the battery industry, and they seem to believe it will come down ultimately 5-10x. <br><br>* Li is cheap resource to mine and refine, you can scrape it off the sand and it<sq>s atomic 3, so energy for breaking salts is low. <br><br>* Batteries are simply tin burritos of lithium paste... they are simple things. <br><br>So Li and H2 will both get incredibly cheap, and both will get cheap at approximately the same time frames and amounts... which is an amazing coincidence. <br><br>1. What I expect, is to see H2 aircraft, trains, busses, trucks, boats, and industrial et al... Due simply to the deltas of needing few fueling points, and those fueling points being in similar locations to industrial centers, plus the fact that those things require huge amount of energy, which would require new tech to properly solving as a pure EV. <br><br>2. Then to have Li be the consumer standard, where a relatively tiny amount of power is available everywhere. <br><br>In other words, I expect to see exactly what is happening now. Honda isn<sq>t wrong, and they make lots of things, but specifically to consumer things, I think they are wrong. It is also worth noting that power lines around the world, incl outlets, cords, is a huge amount of copper and labor. <br><br>A better question to ask is<colon> How much more are you willing to pay for the benefits of an electric car<colon> No fuel stops, more horsepower, less fuel cost? 10<percent>, 20<percent>? </p>",

Since the hyperloop has never been constructed before, it doesn<sq>t have any regulatory requirements and it is easy to set a low safety factor on the design which is technically sufficient. On the other hand trains have been around for a long period of time and are heavily regulated. This ends up ballooning safety factors<colon> you need to build heavier structures, leave more time between trains, have more employees to watch this system, etc. If  the hyperloop were actually constructed it would be only a matter of time before something happened, people companied against it, and new costs were introduced.<br><br>Think about how safe public trains and airplanes are, but every time a single person is hurt we go through years of investigation, legislation, and regulation to prevent that issue form every happening again. That is extremely expensive.<br><br>I<sq>m not intending to make a political statement about whether this process is good or bad, but it happens and the only advantage of the hyperloop I can see is that it is currently new. If the train was new, it would look much cheaper than it is.<br><br>What I<sq>d like to see is a fast transportation system that can carry a car for an affordable sum. When I visit another city I still need to go places, and that means renting cars. I<sq>d love to drive my car to the train station, go 300 miles in 20 minutes, and then drive to my destination. I would absolutely be willing to take a slower method of transportation across the country if I could bring my car for the same price as a the plane ticket would be anyways. Coast to coast in 10 hours and I can take my car? Sure.</p>",

But I<sq>m going to add some information about the grid and generator load sharing.<br><br>If you have a single generator powering any bus or grid, that generator is completely in  charge of the frequency and voltage on that bus. I<sq>m going to focus on frequency here, since the power/load balance directly affects frequency. For your generator to supply sufficient power, it needs to rack an appropriate amount of fuel (whether it<sq>s diesel fuel, water, steam, etc). If it racks too much, frequency goes up, and if it racks too little, frequency goes down. So frequency is the controlled variable. If frequency is too high, then the generator<sq>s governor will reduce the amount of fuel it is using, and if frequency is too low, it will increase the fuel usage. If you add a new load to the bus, the frequency will drop, and the governor will increase fuel rack to restore it to normal. This is speed/frequency control mode, and is how emergency generators and ship generators typically operate.<br><br>This works great, until you start adding more generators. Then the generators have to fight to control frequency. One may be increasing fuel rack while the other decreases fuel rack, and they may cause instabilities. It takes good enegineering to ensure there are no instabilities, or proper control of your systems. In a multi-generator system, each generator will share a portion of the load. If frequency drops by .1<percent> in a 2 generator system, then all generators only need to increase load by 0.05<percent> to maintain frequency. This isn<sq>t too bad.<br><br>In a very large system like the power grid, your single generator is way too small to affect grid frequency or voltage. Taking any generator, even a large nuclear generator, from no load to full load will have (figuratively) no impact on grid frequency. The power grid acts like an infinite bus, and your generator has no control authority. If your generator was told to maintain voltage at exactly 60 hz, and actual frequency was 59.99, your generator will keep adding more and more fuel until it overspeeds and trips, or mechanically fails. It will never get frequency back up to 60 hz on its own, because the grid is so large compared to it. <br><br>So on a large power grid, generators don<sq>t operate primarily in the speed control mode. They either are base loaded (running at a fixed output), or they operate in droop mode. Droop mode is a proportional style control mode. When a generator is in droop mode, you set the normal 60hz output you want the generator to produce. If the grid is at exactly 60hz, your generator will produce exactly what you asked it to. If the grid is running faster than 60hz, then your generator will reduce its load by a certain percentage of how much faster it is, and if the grid is slower than 60hz, the generator will reduce its load by a certain percentage. Typically droop mode is 5<percent>, meaning that if the grid is at 105<percent> frequency, your generator produces 0<percent> of what you asked it to, and at 100<percent> frequency (60 hz), the generator produces what you asked it exactly. If the grid is below 60 hz, the generator will pick up load proportionally to how much you originally set it at. All generators on the grid have droop functions enabled to some extent, and nearly all of them utilize a 5<percent> droop, meaning that all generators will try to evenly share load. <br><br>For small and quick changes, variable/peaking units can automatically follow grid demand signals from a central system, and if grid frequency starts to go outside of normal bounds the droop functions start to affect generator output. If grid frequency starts increasing more than 0.5<percent>, even large baseload units will start having a droop response (my plant<sq>s main generator droop function doesn<sq>t start until the grid is at 100.5<percent> frequency, and our no-load is at 105.5<percent>, this doubles as an initial overspeed protection for the generator and turbine).<br><br>Of course, these regulating functions don<sq>t handle it all. Base load and load following plants are typically given a load profile to follow, and the grid operator can dispatch these plants to different values. Typically the dispatch time is ~15 minutes for the power plant to respond. Each plant that meets certain criteria on the grid also has emergency load/unload profiles that they agree to respond to in this time frame (for example, my unit has a 300 MWe load drop in 15 minute contingency with the our local grid operator, in the event that certain combinations of lines fail, to prevent transformer overheating). <br><br>Some plants have automatic load controls which can follow signals directly from the power grid, some need to be manually controlled (like nuclear units in the US, despite the fact that many of them have the technology installed to automatically do so). Some units only come online and offline when told to, like peaking units (Combustion turbines, etc).<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>",

Attach the cable from the clock tower as they do in the movie but have it terminate in a circular connector in the center of the circular track. Then you<sq>ve got a short cable run to the car. If you want to get fancy, you can skip the cable run and keep the metal pole on top of the car. As long as the distance between the central connector and the top of the pole is short enough, the lightning can just jump the air gap without losing too much power. <br><br>The track would be relatively small, given that the green space near the courthouse looks to maybe be a hundred yards wide, tops. So Marty is going to be experiencing non-negligible g-forces. By using the circular track you also eliminate the uncertainty of the exact microsecond the lightning hit the clock tower (all Marty actually knows is the minute, giving up 60 seconds of error). The DeLorean can buzz around that track for as long as it likes. Assuming Marty doesn<sq>t throw up while he<sq>s driving the world most expensive Tilt-A-Whirl. <br><br>All of this assumes Doc Brown has some ability to erect a large inclined circular track in the middle of the town square which is sturdy enough to handle a DeLorean accelerating up to 88 mph and holding it for at least a couple of minutes while being hit by lightning *without* being arrested so fast that *he* actually travels through time. <br><br>The downside is that, apparently, momentum is conserved when jumping through time. So the DeLorean, doing 88 mph several feet above the ground in a circular track, will appear in mid-air in 1985 and promptly fly into the nearest building - most of which appeared to be brick. <br><br>I ... may have spent too much time trying to figure this out over the last 30 years. </p>",

Shits heavy, heavy material is used in turbines/generators which will weight multiple tonnes. Generators are filled with iron and copper.... LOTS of iron and copper. <br><br>I want to keep writing about all the technical issues they would encounter (control systems would just be screaming with alarms and trips which would be locking them out of starting things), but there is just too much.<br><br>There are too many things against them... no... just no...<br><br>Edit<colon> Another issue is how everything is bolted together. Large bolts tightened with torque-setting devices are used to apply multiple hundreds of Nms (Newton-Meters) of force onto the equipment to ensure they don<sq>t fly off their footings. Power cables are tightened (terminated) onto the generators output terminals with the same force. Again... not impossible... however very difficult to remove without a breaking bar or a similar purpose-built tool.<br><br>**Edit2<colon> TLDR<colon> Most people can<sq>t troubleshoot when their WI-FI goes down... just sayin<sq>...**<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>Edit<colon> tldr since I wasn<sq>t clear. At some point in time the reactor will automatically shut down, however nuclear waste in the fuel continues to produce heat, so the emergency cooling systems will need to run, and at some point that stuff would eventually fail leading to core damage. <br><br>Nuclear engineer here. On a day to day basis, we refill oil in various pumps and equipment, we refill various tanks for closed cooling systems, we reprocess water that leaks internally to the plant then transfer that water back to the primary coolant system, we make regular reactivity adjustments to compensate for burnup and to compensate for valve drift, and we also have to equalize pressure between our drywell and wetwell compartments inside the reactor containment. We have to deal with condensation in summer time (station water inventory goes up) and evaporation in winter time (water level in tanks and pools goes down). We also do a lot of small voltage adjustments to the main generator to help keep the grid inside a fairly narrow voltage band. Since my plant is the largest MVAR source in the region we do the majority of voltage boosts for the region.<br><br>If we don<sq>t do these things we will end up with a reactor scram, and some combination of failed equipment and pumps on the non-safety equipment, and eventually failed safety equipment. If left unattended long enough this could lead to a loss of adequate core cooling and subsequent fuel damage/core damage and release of radioactive materials.<br><br>Most nuclear power plants (Generation 2 and most Generation 3 plants) are designed with the idea that the automatic control systems will handle the plant with no operator actions for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Thats it. Afterwards the operators are expected to intervene and make the best actions for stabilizing the plant and bringing the plant to cold shutdown (reality is we usually take control of the plant within seconds or a minute at most). Because of these short time frames, it is a legal requirement that the plant have a minimum staffing both of control room operators and equipment operators.<br><br>The bare minimum comes down to around 16 people for a single unit site. In the control room, you must have 1 licensed Reactor operator at the control, and a senior reactor operator within earshot of the alarm panels. You need at least 1 additional RO. You need a shift manager who can fill the role of emergency director until the emergency response organization is activated. You need a Shift Technical Advisor (someone with an engineering degree who has been trained on reactor accidents to act as an independent advisor). You need at least 1 Safe Shutdown Operator to run the ECCS systems (does not need a license). You need a fully functioning fire brigade separate from this (5 members, 1 leader and 2 teams of 2 for search and attack). You need 1 electrical/instrument tech who can defeat safety interlocks and perform quick repairs. You need an emergency dose assesser and a radiation protection technician. And there are a handful of other emergency roles that need to be fulfilled, typically a chemistry technician, an ERO communicator, and an additional Senior reactor operator license. <br><br>Generation 3+ nuclear power reactors like the AP-1000 plants being built at Votgle and VC Summer have built in 72 hour mostly passive safety functions. These functions require battery power to activate, and once they start they need no power to function and with offsite support (fire trucks) can run for weeks. It is not ideal to use passive core and containment cooling systems though, as this causes a lot of stress inside the containment and to the reactor, so ideally the operators will use the same active safety systems that Gen 2 and 3 plants use to stabilize the plant and bring it to cold shutdown. <br><br>If you just leave the reactor for a short amount of time, other than violating federal law and having people go to prison, the plant should be fine. Automatic safety and control systems take care of everything for those short time frames. On a typical day to day shift in the control room at my current plant, I<sq>ve seen shifts where we the operators did no manipulations of controls except for occasional voltage bumps or drops to match daily load/demand (and if that werent done it wouldnt immediately impact the plant, we would just get fined up to 1 million dollars per day for failure to meet our voltage profile).<br><br>Some other info that might be worth knowing. Spent nuclear fuel from BWR plants cannot be air cooled until it has been removed from the reactor for at least 3 months. PWR fuel needs 11 months of decay time. Until this time period occurs, the spent fuel could be damaged or even ignite in a zircalloy-steam reaction leading to large radioactive releases. <br><br>I hope this helps a little bit with your questions. Please feel free to ask more!</p>",

The switchgear and breakers for nearly all the equipment for units 1-4 were submerged and damaged. Additionally, there was damage to the Balance of Plant (BOP) systems at units 1-4 that would have made it uncertain whether you could even try to use the equipment for a restart. They actually had a functioning air cooled diesel generator for a few hours at units 1-4, but with no working breakers or switchgear, there was no way to get that power to loads in the plant. The flooding and loss of the emergency switchgear was far worse than the loss of the emergency generators, as it not only knocked out most of the DC batteries, but it also prevented portable generators from being brought on site and hooked up to restore critical loads to the ECCS. <br><br>Answers that add more info<colon><br><br>>after about one day meltdown was certain because of insufficient cooling<br><br>Melting began at unit 1 in 2-3 hours after the tsunami. Unit 3 after about 35-36 hours (a couple hours after HPCI tripped), and Unit 2 after 73-74 hours (a couple hours after RCIC tripped).<br><br>You had no electrical power to operate any of the reactor controls. To reset the SCRAM in a GE Boiling water reactor, you need, at a minimum, instrument air supplies to the reactor building to close the scram pilot valves and electricity to the RPS motor generators. They had no power to the motor generators, so you can<sq>t electrically reset the scram. And you can<sq>t pneumatically reset the scram without instrument air compressors. Those compressors are cooled by primary service water, which is typically a non-safety load and has no backup power. You had no electricity to reset the scram, which means no way to remove control rods. Additionally to move control rods in the first place, you need the control rod drive hydraulic pumps in operation, which also had no power.<br><br>Some other things<colon> With the loss of power, you lose fill and vent in your condensate system, and you lose condenser vacuum. It takes hours to refill these systems and reestablish vacuum. These are minimum requirements for starting up. You had no way to operate the secondary side with the generator.<br><br>And another really big one! <br><br>The operating license for reactors does not allow startup until you have met all the mode requirements to enter Mode 2, Reactor Startup Mode.

Even if you could restart the reactor, any operator who did so in Japan could be jailed.

You are proof of that.  <br><br>As for losing knowledge when people leave, that can be prevented if the company is proactive about how it handles it<sq>s information.  If tasks are handled by more people and if those people are fully aware of what others are doing, then it<sq>s not a big deal if one of them leaves.  More likely, they do a very good job of documenting everything.  That way, the vast majority of their knowledge would be digitally stored somewhere, and not locked up inside someone<sq>s head.....which is actually a pretty big problem for many companies.  <br><br>So to answer your question....I guess that it is realistic, because they go through engineers and will be needing more.  But at the same time, there are still a lot of people wanting those jobs so it will be competitive.  Keep those grades up.  </p>",

Engines such as turbines used in power stations, diesel-electric freight trains, etc. are designed for maximum thermal efficiency at a very specific speed, and the operators will generally minimize any time spent on starting and shut-down. With a stationary engine, you obviously can<sq>t measure its<sq> lifespan in distance, so how do you define the service intervals? Time! Since these engines operate at a constant speed for the vast majority of their operational life, if you know how many hours an engine has run, then you have a measurement that can be correlated to wear-and-tear to define service intervals in terms of operating hours.<br><br>Vehicles are a completely different beast though. The average car has the engine driving the wheels via a geared transmission. Each gear set has a specific ratio that allows the vehicle to operate at a wide range of speeds while keeping the engine within a certain RPM range. The different gear ratios mean that engine speed is not constant, so you can<sq>t just track the operating hours of the vehicle. If the engine runs for one hour, that hour could have been entirely idling at 800 RPM, or it could have been driven flat-out for an hour on a track day. Since the rotational velocity is not constant, you need a different measurement to approximate the operation of the engine. Time alone can<sq>t tell you much, but DISTANCE on the other hand... count the revolutions of a wheel, multiply by the circumference, and you<sq>ve got a quantifiable measurement that has more of a correlation to the functional life of the engine than time alone.<br><br>Is distance perfect? No, absolutely not. Distance alone doesn<sq>t tell you how <dq>hard<dq> a vehicle was driven, simply how far it went. It<sq>s not practical to define service intervals in terms of engine velocity or the number of revolutions of the crankshaft. This is why vehicles come with two interval definitions, like <dq>6 months, or every 5000 miles<dq> so if you drive super aggressively you<sq>ll hit the 5000 miles before 6 months. Grandma<sq>s car that only drives to and from church on Sundays is obviously not getting worked as hard and can run longer intervals between maintenance, hence the time window in addition to straight mileage.</p>",

The impact stripped the fire insulation from the floor trusses and many of the columns in the impact zone, and<br><br>1. it started a fire on multiple floors, which was problematic now that the primary structural columns in the impact zone lacked of fireproofing. <br><br>---<br><br>##Static vs. Dynamic<br><br>Even though there was still ~80<percent> of undamaged structure below the impact zone, this does NOT mean it was <dq>progressively stronger<dq>. High-rise structures are NOT designed to handle **dynamic loads** in the gravity direction.<br><br>Dynamic, as opposed to static, means there are moving parts transferring load, or that the load itself changes direction or magnitude. A good example is aircraft landing gear, which retracts when it hits the ground to transfer loads into the rest of the [landing gear mechanism](http<colon>//media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/84/103484-004-B5AA445B.gif).<br><br>When designing a landing gear, you do not design it to handle only the weight of the aircraft, but rather some multiplication of the aircraft<sq>s weight. A typical landing gear design will safely handle 4-5X the aircraft<sq>s weight. High-rise structures are not designed to the same limits as landing gears because they aren<sq>t expected to handle dynamic loads in the direction of gravity. In the case of the WTC towers, a floor collapsing onto the floor below was the dynamic load, and the sign that global progressive collapse had begun.<br><br>---<br><br>##Failure modes<br><br>The structural elements failed in a few ways<colon><br><br>1. **Material yielding** - simply means the loads exceed the strength of the material and the structural member will literally shear, tear, bend, or deform to give way to the load.<br><br>2. **Buckling** - a specific type of failure where the vertical load exceeds the critical buckling force and causes a column to [bend in different directions](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling#/media/File<colon>Buckledmodel.JPG) depending on how the ends are constrained. Short columns tend to fail at the material yield limit, while long slender columns tend to buckle before bending to the material yield limit before failing.<br>  * Critical buckling force is calculated by F = (pi^2 E) / (KL/r)^2 , where E is Young<sq>s Modulus, and KL is the effective length of the column, and KL/r is the *slenderness ratio* (r = radius of gyration). A thin column has small radius of gyration and a stocky column has large radius of gyration. The slenderness ratio determines elastic or inelastic mode of buckling failure.<br><br>3. **Catenary failure** - this is when beams (horizontal members) <dq>sag<dq> under the weight from above it has to support due to the loss or failure of a column underneath. This has the double action of pulling in adjacent columns inward while also pulling downward.<br><br>---<br><br>##Sequence of events leading to failure<br><br>Now knowing these concepts, here is the sequence of events leading up to structural failure<colon><br><br>1. As an act of terrorism, a plane crashed into the building substantially changing the structural integrity of the overall frame. <br><br>2. The plane was loaded with jet fuel that in turn ignited office furnishings that had been concentrated in a corner by the force of impact.<br><br>3. The collision disrupted/loosened/knocked off fireproofing of structural members, especially the main span floor trusses that ran between the exterior wall and the interior core.<br><br>4. Over time the floor trusses began heating and losing their structural integrity, including sagging into a catenary mode. This eventually failed one end of their gravity/lateral mode connections. The failure to either end would be problematic for the unsupported length of the building<sq>s columns, and lowering its vertical load carrying capacity. The failure at the exterior wall is most likely due to heat and bolt sizing. Perhaps, those floor trusses then collapsed onto the lower level spread heat/fire to the adjacent stories and added to the heat exposure of the exterior columns, increasing their KL/r ratio beyond their design limit for steel at a given temperature. Or possibly, that failure mode might have initiated at a mid-story [column splice](http<colon>//www.steelconstruction.info/images/thumb/5/51/C18-08.png/700px-C18-08.png).<br><br>5. The lack of support to the exterior columns continued until failure was initiated. A seam-like failure indicated a failure may have been imminent and only needed one to fail for all to fail.<br><br>6. Progressive collapse is initiated which is unstoppable once initiated.<br><br>---<br><br>##TL;DR<colon> Why can<sq>t progressive collapses be stopped?<br><br>Even though the lower undamaged structure was designed to be able to handle the upper damaged 18 stories, **this is only true in a static sense**. Once the load became dynamic, the dynamic loads had already far exceeded the structural design limit and the failure had to propagate until all the energy is dissipated.<br><br>This is true for nearly every structure in existence, and certainly true for every skyscraper<colon> once progressive collapse begins, it can<sq>t be stopped because the supporting structure below cannot handle the many multiplications of the load it was designed to support.<br><br>**It<sq>s erroneous to think of a skyscraper as a solid column of material that<sq>s able to stop falling objects.** In reality a skyscraper is more like a skeletal structure with thousands of interconnected supporting members. The loss of too many members/supports will cause failure. A giant mass falling through the center of the skeleton will only knock more of the structure away, further propagating the collapse.<br><br>Another comment I wrote regarding the role of fire damage in initiating progressive collapse in WTC 1 & 2<colon> https<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/33tl74/how_did_the_wtc_north_tower_top_section_fall_and/cqr683e<br><br>---<br><br>References<colon><br><br>1. http<colon>//www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610<br><br>1. http<colon>//www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0112/eagar/eagar-0112.html<br><br>1. http<colon>//www.aisc.org/uploadedFiles/Research/Research_Reports/Sezen<percent>20-<percent>20Progressive<percent>20Collapse.pdf<br><br>1. http<colon>//www-personal.umich.edu/~eltawil/catenary-action.html<br><br>1. http<colon>//www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/project/research/structures/strucfire/CaseStudy/HistoricFires/BuildingFires/worldTradeCenter.htm<br><br>1. https<colon>//app.aws.org/wj/supplement/WJ_2007_09_s263.pdf<br><br>1. http<colon>//www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0711/banovic-0711.html<br><br>1. http<colon>//fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire05/PDF/f05157.pdf<br><br>1. https<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2hpgtm/a_updated_nova_episode_explains_some_of_the/<br><br>1. https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPqxJpykW00</p>",

Everything he does is in some way contributing to his ultimate goal of making humanity a multiplanetary species. He frequently compares Earth to a hard drive with no backup of the data - every so often, there<sq>s a planet-wide mass extinction event of one kind or another. His honest-to-God view is that if humans don<sq>t build self-sufficient space colonies before the next one inevitably arrives, it<sq>s game over. This is what this guy stays up at night worrying about. Furthermore, the technology to do it doesn<sq>t exist forever - civilisations can and do fall (see the Romans), and now that our society has stripped Earth of all the easily accessible surface minerals and fossil fuel deposits, would subsistence farmers beginning from scratch even be able to reach our current technology level if our civilisation did collapse? Think about it, Victorian engineers were able to dig the first oil wells on the California beaches with primitive hand-tools, but now that<sq>s mostly depleted would a future second society at that technology level be able to drill for the only remaining oil thousands of feet below the Gulf of Mexico? We face the distinct and unsettling possibility that a second Industrial Revolution may be impossible without the easy start we had. He honestly believes that now we have spaceflight, the next hundred years or so - perhaps less - may be our only chance to spread out before catastrophe strikes<colon> and the opportunity closes forever because we used all the raw materials accessible from a low level of technology.<br><br>Every one of his ventures is trying to force open as many fronts on the window of opportunity to build bases on Mars before nuclear war, a K-T level asteroid strike, or some other disaster slams it shut<colon><br><br>- SpaceX<colon> The obvious one. The Interplanetary Transport System has already been unveiled. Landing Falcon 9 stages upright with supersonic retropropulsion isn<sq>t just about saving money - conveniently, it<sq>s also the only way to land something the size of an ocean liner on Mars safely and reusably. The whole thing is the most amazing collection of hard test results and engineering experience about slowing down from hypersonic speeds to the thin Martian atmospheric density that<sq>s so well approximated by our stratosphere. Just ask NASA, they<sq>re crazy about the SpaceX supersonic retropropulsion data because it<sq>s so relevant to Mars entry.<br>- SpaceX Internet constellation<colon> One hell of a revenue stream to fund their Mars colonisation efforts once they start offering internet all over the world that<sq>s faster than most traditional ISPs and very low ping. If applied to Mars, would bring communication capabilities up by several orders of magnitude (as required for human cities), as well as potentially providing a Martian form of GPS.<br>- Tesla<colon> Internal combustion engines don<sq>t work on Mars. Nuclear is very expensive. Lithium ion batteries are the most likely power storage, and getting their costs down and energy density up is becoming hugely relevant to any space application. High performance lightweight electric motors will make excellent manned rovers. Manufacturing automation will be critical for self-sufficiency and the Gigafactory is state-of-the-art in that.<br>- SolarCity<colon> See above. $/kWh of solar panels directly contributes to getting enough electricity on Mars to realistic cost levels.<br>- The Boring Company<colon> It<sq>s significantly easier to colonise Mars with underground habitation. A few metres of dirt shields you from the harmful cosmic radiation (on Earth, the magnetic field does this for us, but Mars doesn<sq>t have one) and as a bonus now you can let a cylindrical tunnel provide most of the structural integrity. The pressure liner to contain our air can be much thinner and expanding is trivial compared to building new surface structures. Martian subsurface is also an excellent place to find water ice - not just for human needs, but for ISRU electrolysis of fuel to get back to Earth. (Another reason why solar+lithium is critical)<br><br>**TL;DR** whatever idea he has, it<sq>ll work on Mars. That<sq>s what all his mad ideas lead into one way or another. Expect massive automation - his final invention would, ideally, be able to deploy itself from a cargo hold on Mars and run fully unmanned, to create a prepared base long before any humans arrive.

They are used to smooth the output voltage.<br><br>3 look like a transistor that is used to control the output voltages by pulse width modulation, basically they turn off and on faster and faster to increase the voltage. It looks like 5 is another, smaller transistor that is used to drive the larger transistor. <br><br>So whats happening here is 7 is most likely the PWM controller. It receives a voltage input from the potentiometers (which are variable resistors, numbered 6 in your picture). The higher the voltage, the faster it will turn on and off one of the corresponding small transistors. The small transistors will then turn the larger transistors on and off at the same rate. This is done because the amount of current needed to turn the large transistors on and off is probably more than the PWM controller can safely put out, but it can safely drive the smaller transistors, which can safely drive the larger transistors. <br><br>So why do all of this instead of hooking the fans right up to the potentiometers? Because that would mean the pots have to dissipate that wasted voltage as heat, which is inefficient and means that if you want really low voltages like 2 or 3 volts from 12, you are making a ton of heat and need some pretty heavy duty pots. Also, this way you can probably put out 1.5A maximum to each fan, where as a 1A, 12V potentiometer is about the same price, if not more, than the components used here. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Wow, the first few comments I read on this have some wildly inaccurate information, so I figure I<sq>ll try to explain.<br><br>First, I am a licensed electrician with a LOT of experience with grounding and bonding. The owner of the electrical contractor I work for (a man I work along side quite a bit and with whom I discuss issues exactly like this often) sits on the NEC code panel 5 which writes (among a few others) article 250<colon> Grounding and Bonding.<br><br>Before addressing this question, it<sq>s important to define a few terms. When talking about electrical power systems in the US, **Ground** simply refers to the Earth. **Grounding** is the action of electrically connecting something to a **Grounding Electrode**, which is a conductive object used to create a direct connection to ground--typically a Ground Rod. A **Grounded Conductor** is circuit conductor (wire) which is intentionally grounded--in grounded electrical systems, like virtually all electrical systems in residential and commercial structures, the **Grounded Conductor** is the white (or gray) wire, which is commonly referred to as the *Neutral* (it<sq>s called the neutral because it is connected to the neutral point of the system at the electrical source). The reason we ground electrical systems has absolutely NOTHING to do with <sq>oh shit moments<sq> when a normally current carrying conductor touches a normally non-current carrying conductive part of equipment, structures, or people. (I<sq>ll get back to this in a moment) An **Ungrounded Conductor** is a circuit conductor which is NOT electrically continuous with the ground (this is the black, red, blue, orange, yellow, brown, etc wire commonly referred to as the *Hot Wire*).<br><br>Now is when we start to get into the confusing part, mostly due to the fact that a lot of these things have very similar and very misleading names. A **Ground-Fault** is an unintentional electrically continuous connection between the ungrounded (hot) conductor and normally non-current carrying conductive parts of equipment, structures, etc. This is the <sq>oh shit moment<sq> when a hot wire touches a metal box, metal beam in a structure, metal strap on a switch or receptacle, or pretty much anything else that it<sq>s not supposed to. A **Ground-Fault Current Path** (sometimes referred to as a <sq>Low Impedance Ground-Fault Current Path<sq> although this is a slightly different thing, for the purpose of this discussion, we can treat them as the same) is an electrically conductive path from the point of the Ground-Fault to the source of the electricity, through normally non-current carrying conductors. Typically, a ground-fault current path is achieved through a **Equipment Grounding Conductor** (EGC). An EGC is a normally non-current carrying conductive path which connects all other normally non-current carrying conductive parts of equipment and structures to the source of the electricity in order to provide a ground-fault current path. The EGC is the green (or sometimes bare copper) wire which is commonly referred to as the *ground wire*. The ONLY purpose for the EGC (or green wire) is to clear a ground-fault (clearing a ground-fault means tripping a breaker or blowing a fuse) in the <sq>oh shit moments<sq>. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with the ground or the Earth and will work exactly as it is intended to regardless of whether it is connected to the Earth or not. (It is important to note that the NEC does not require the EGC to be a wire. If circuit conductors are pulled through metallic tubing, for example, there are rules which allow that metallic tubing to be used as the EGC).<br><br>**Bonding** is the act of connecting two electrically conductive things (usually metal, wires, etc) in a manner such that they are electrically continuous. A **Main Bonding Jumper** is a conductor which connects the grounded conductor (neutral wire) to the grounding electrode (ground rod physically in contact with the Earth) at the electrical service. In a house, the main bonding jumper is typically a piece of metal in the panel which connects the neutral bar (the bar where all of the white wires are terminated) to the metal box of the panel. This is the connection which gives the grounded conductor it<sq>s name.<br><br>Now that I<sq>ve defined the relevant terms, let<sq>s get into the purpose of these things. In an effort to avoid confusion and make my explanation as clear as possible, in this portion I will use the terms OP used, each of which are in italics *italics* above where they are defined by their proper term (in **bold**). <br><br>There are 2 very common myths regarding electricity which are important to dispel at this point. Myth 1<colon> electricity is <sq>trying to get to ground or the Earth<sq>. Get this out of your head right now and forget you ever heard it. This is not true and I have heard many stories of people who created harmful situations because they believed this whole-heartedly. Fact 1<colon>electricity is <sq>trying to get back to it<sq>s source<sq>. <br><br>Myth 2<colon> electricity takes the path of least resistance. If this were true, it would be impossible to connect circuits in parallel, because the electricity would only take the parallel path which has the least resistance. Basic electrical theory and Kirchhoff<sq>s Law tell us this isn<sq>t true. Fact 2<colon> electricity takes ALL conductive paths available to it.<br><br>The reason we bond all normally non-current carrying conductive parts back to the source (through the *ground wire*) is so we have a closed circuit when the *hot wire* touches something it<sq>s not supposed to. Since the ground-fault current path has inherently much higher resistance than the *neutral wire*, the amount of current flowing through the circuit jumps enormously during a ground-fault. The circuit breaker in the panel is designed such that it will open when more current passes through it than it is designed to allow (and is actually designed to open faster the higher the current is). So the *ground wire* is there as a safety mechanism which allows the circuit breaker to operate as it is supposed to.<br><br>In an alternating current system, the current is constantly switching directions (60 times per second in the US). This creates an electric field which is constantly expanding, collapsing, switching polarity and expanding again, then collapsing again (again, 60 times per second). An expanding or collapsing magnetic field will induce an electrical current on a conductor. So when you have a *hot* and a *neutral* wire very close together running through a cable or conduit, the magnetic field created by the current in the *hot* wire induces a tiny amount of current in the *neutral* wire. When people first started using alternating current, they found out that this induced current can alter the electrical potential of the *neutral*, meaning that you won<sq>t always have the voltage you designed the system to have. They also figured out that, if you connect the *neutral* to the Earth, the induced current will <sq>stabilize<sq>. It is still there, but it becomes MUCH more predictable and you can now design systems to provide the voltage you want. <br><br><br>Ok, now that I have gone on for WAY too long and probably confused the hell out of some people and bored the hell out of everyone else, let me directly answer OPs questions directly.<br><br>>The ground wire is connected to a metal pole buried deeply near your house (literally ground).<br><br>This is true, but, more importantly, the *ground* wire is also connected to the *neutral* wire in the panel and, therefore, back to the source of the electricity. The *ground* wire doesn<sq>t need to be connected to the Earth, it just happens to be because the *neutral* is connected to the Earth (to stabilize the voltage).<br><br><br>>When a device has a ground wire it usually has a metal case and is used as a grounding wire so that you don<sq>t get shocked when touching the case.<br><br>The *ground* wire is present to provide a ground-fault current path back to the source of the electricity so that the circuit breaker will open during a ground-fault. The only time a metal case could shock someone is if it were to come in contact with the *hot* wire (or *neutral* in a closed circuit) AND it were not connected to the *ground* wire.<br><br><br>>The weird thing about ground is that at the fuse box it<sq>s connected to neutral<br><br>This is because they both need to be connected back to the source of the electricity in order for a circuit breaker to work.<br><br><br>>since they are forced to have the same voltage (due to the connection) what is the purpose of having a ground on the outlet?<br><br>The *ground* at the receptacle is there to extend the ground-fault current path into whatever piece of equipment is plugged in to the receptacle. This is why some things have a ground prong on their plug and some things do not. If there are no normally non-current carrying conductive parts (or the equipment is designed in such a way that the manufacturer feels confident enough that the normally non-current carrying conductive parts will not accidentally become energized), it does not need to be connected to the ground-fault current path.<br><br><br>>I imagine they are connected in a rare case that the neutral line gets <dq>dirty<dq> power and could shock the user, but since it is connected to <dq>ground<dq> directly that shouldn<sq>t be the case.<br><br>Anytime you have a closed circuit, there will be current flowing through the *neutral* and can pose a shock hazard to someone who comes in contact with it. The *neutral* (remember, the technical term for the *neutral* wire is the **Grounded Conductor**) is connected to ground in order to stabilize the voltage on the system.<br><br>**tl;dr the terms <sq>ground<sq>, <sq>grounded<sq>, and <sq>grounding<sq> get thrown around a lot, sometimes when they should not, and, even when used properly, are highly misleading. The <sq>ground<sq> wire is a safety mechanism to allow the breaker to open in an <sq>oh shit<sq> moment and the <sq>neutral<sq> is connected to the Earth to stabilize voltage in alternating current systems**</p>",

                "answer": "<p>> The weird thing about ground is that at the fuse box it<sq>s connected to neutral<br><br>You have it somewhat backwards here<colon> the reason that the ground is connected to neutral in power systems is to make _neutral connected to ground at the location of your junction box_. It turns out that the Earth has a non-zero impedance, so the best way to make sure that neutral at your house is the same voltage as the ground of your house is to wire them together at your house. Otherwise, you get a floating neutral due to the difference in potentials between your house ground and the ground _at the power plant_.<br><br>That is to say, the sink to ground for the neutral wire of an electrical grid is every junction box on the grid. The neutral wire is a <dq>bus<dq> that connects the ground of all the buildings on the grid. And yes, the difference in ground potentials across the grid does cause a circuit to form between houses on the grid and the neutral wire of the grid. Thankfully over large distances, the impedance of the earth is high enough that it<sq>s OK to wire the earth together like this.<br><br>Secondly, it<sq>s possible for neutral to float within your house. Imagine a number of appliances in series on one circuit in your house. It is possible for the neutral wire to start floating above the ground at the junction box, even under normal operating circumstances, because the impedances of the appliances in this grouping in effect cut off the short-circuit-to-ground effect that you might imagine the neutral wire to have. <br><br>Since you studied electrical engineering, think of each appliance on the neutral wire as a series of pull-down resistors between neutral and ground<colon> generally, if nothing is at signal high above the resistor, the resistor pulls the circuit down to ground by default. When you start pulling the circuit high, however, your resistor allows you to do so without there being an electrical short to ground. Turning on the appliance, and the capacitive / inductive load that happens especially with motors involved, is like a short-duration pull-up of the neutral wire. We don<sq>t want the chassis of the device itself to get a similar pull-up effect, but that wasn<sq>t taken into account in the olden days.<br><br>It used to be the case in 2 prong days that the appliance chassis was wired to neutral, since that should theoretically be <dq>close enough<dq> to ground most of the time, but in non-ideal situations where the circuit could float more than usual off the ground (especially in a malfunction scenario where something like a short causes the neutral to be pulled especially far from ground), it was discovered that theoretical wasn<sq>t always actual. Touching the appliance, therefore, could turn _you_ into a lower-impedance path from the floating neutral to ground than through all of the appliances on the circuit.<br><br>The addition of the ground wire simply replaces your body with a wire which does not go through any impedance of any appliance and is therefore not likely to float. It allows the body of the appliance to be at a different potential than the machinery of the appliance even under temporary transients. Temporary pull-ups of the neutral wire are now isoloated. Longer-term pull-ups, like those caused by malfunctions, are likely to pop a fuse or circuit breaker, of course, but if the current draw between the neutral and hot wires is not high enough to trip the breaker, you still can touch the appliance rather than having the appliance hang out at a high potential waiting for you to touch it.</p>",

The hotter you burn air, the more likely the excess heat can combine O2 and N2 endothermically into NOx. <br><br>The temperature of combustion is governed by a number of things. Turbo chargers increase pressure and increase heat. Higher energy fuel. High compression ratios. Diesel oil is a higher energy fuel, diesel engines have higher compression ratios, and diesels almost always have turbos.  The result is a very hot air combustion temperature and thus more NOx.<br><br>That higher temperature also has major benefits. Carnot cycle tells you the higher temperature differential, the more efficient a thermal engine can be. This is also true for internal combustion engines (ICE). ICE<sq>s efficiency and power is also directly tied to the compression ratio.    These benefits of high gas temperature is why diesel engines tend to get better economy. <br><br>The demand of the design engineer is to balance the benefits of efficiency with the negatives of NOx. Often, it is beneficial to add additional post piston equipment to lower NOx and keep higher temperatures.  NOx releases energy when its converted back into O2 and N2, so the first device is an EGR valve the recirculates some of the exhaust back into the intake so the NOx can be burned (usually done when less horsepower is needed from the engine). The second is a catalytic converter that removes oxygen from NOx to share with CO to turn everything into more pleasant N2, O2, and CO2. And everyone with a car diesel other than VW has also needed to add urea as a third round of NOx reduction. Urea is a liquid reactant that is squirted into the exhaust that reacts with NOx to make O2 and NH3.<br><br>The issue is that all of this post processing equipment costs money to put into vehicles. If you don<sq>t have it you may not have competitive fuel economy and you may not meet emissions regulation, so every company except VW put them in.<br><br>VW, somewhere in the chain, figured out that if they could write a computer program that would detect emission testing, they could alter how much air goes into the engine (adjust the turbo) to reduce air temperatures and bring NOx down. But when not emission testing, it could run hot and get good performance. And VW didn<sq>t have to spend the money putting urea systems into their cars.  VW marketting called it clean diesel and for years, <dq>brilliant<dq> VW engineering was able to figure out an efficient urea free car* that no one else could figure out.   Whom knew or didn<sq>t know the truth is still being determined. <br><br>*VW bug and Jetta don<sq>t have urea but the Passat did through the effected years<br><br>The issue now is how to fix it.  Urea systems aren<sq>t cheap and VW didn<sq>t factor its cost into the vehicles. To retrofit such a system back into an old car costs even more. To do that for every vehicle effected would cost a major part of VW<sq>s market cap.   For Passat owners, it will likely be a computer software update that just uses more Urea.  For Bug and Jetta owners, I am sure the engineering team has been given the impossible task to find a way to fix the problem without a urea system. VW said economy isn<sq>t going to change, so I am sure the horsepower is going to see a major drop when the fix comes out.</p>",

These Bosch ECUs have the ability to store between 4 and 7 different fuel maps.

This is why thick spokes are not often seen.<br><br>What you do see sometimes, especially on racing or high performance wheels, is bladed spokes.

In general, if you decrease the number of spokes you will need a stiffer and heavier rim to compensate since it is supported in fewer places.

The consequences of failure of a single spoke also become worse, since it can lead to the complete failure of the wheel.  Finally, there are issues with ride comfort and handling that can be impacted by decreasing spoke count.  A heavier rim can also cause the wheel to feel heavier and accelerate slower since the mass is concentrated far away from the axis of rotation.<br><br>You can see there are a lot of factors involved in selecting spoke count and even the spoke pattern when a manufacturer designs a wheel.

This helps spread shock, instead of putting it all on one section of the rim.<br><br>Another good reason is that when a rim deflects under load or impact, you do NOT want the spoke to go slack.  So ideally you want all the spokes loaded with enough tension that they stretch more than the rim can safely deflect.  With fewer but heavier spokes, this tension would be very high, requiring a thick spoke bed to avoidpulling the nipple though the rim, and unless deap in section the rim would get flat spots under the nipples.  Many deep section rims are in fact built into wheels that use fewer spokes with thicker cross section than normal- not because it is stronger, but because it is more aerodynamic.<br><br>For a really good explanation of bicycle wheel design, check out Jobst Brandt<sq>s book on the subject.

Possibly too tight. Hop into a stone cold car and give it a full throttle pull up a hill and you are being very hard on things. It might not damage things the first time, but you are cutting your engine life drastically. <br><br>Modern engines have greatly reduced this issue with cast cylinder liners bathed directly in coolant. Things heat up much faster because there is much less metal, but physics are still a factor. Your cylinder head rapidly expanding (heating) against the compression lip of your head gasket, which is against the cast iron cylinder liner. There are micro movements and flex. Head gaskets are an issue and do not last forever. <br><br>So the real world answer is warm your engine up for 30 seconds and then be gentle on it until that temperature gauge starts to rise. If you beat on a cold motor you are asking for it.  If you have a boat, idle for 30 seconds, putt putt out of the harbour and slowly bring up the throttle over 45 seconds - 2 minutes after you exit the harbour (much longer with big diesels). It gives everything time to come up to temperature at the same rate.<br><br>Once things hit -30C, you had better be letting everything idle for awhile and wait until that temperature gauge is climbing. The thermal stress is much greater, plus your modern engine is covered in plastic crap that should have been made out of metal in the first place. (I<sq>m talking to you, ford focus). You don<sq>t want that being brittle when your engine is buzzing along on the highway.<br><br>Engine oil has slower heat absorption characteristics than coolant as well. Synthetics have made this a non issue, but conventional oils can seriously thicken up at extreme cold. Back in the day you could actually break the oil pump drive. Arctic nut jobs who choose to live up there have to install engine oil heaters or cover up the bottom of the motor.

In the semiconductor industry, area is carefully budgeted. You also suffer due to yield<colon> not only do larger dies mean fewer dies per wafer, it also increases the probability that a given die will have a defect on it.<br><br>Speed is another issue. CMOS involves a wire being driven a buffer (pairs of transistors, connected to Vcc and ground). The wire, in turn, is connected to the gates of other transistors. When a value flips, the buffer needs to charge the capacitance of the wire it<sq>s driving, and the input capacitance of the gates connected to the wire. That takes power. Smaller transistors and smaller wires have less capacitance. The wire charges more quickly and the transistors flip more quickly. So smaller features means less power and less heat dissipation.<br><br>Speed is also, a lot of the time, about cost. You can do more with faster transistors. Maybe marketing wants to sell it as a faster product. But in many applications the speed of the circuit is fixed by the application (e.g., in communications your chip only needs to run as fast as the protocol standard requires). In these circumstances, a faster clock frequency means you can often design your circuit with fewer transistors. Again, fewer transistors means less area, which means more dies per wafer and a higher yield.</p>",

Those different pipes are made from different alloys with different galvanic corrosion properties. <br><br>Lead leaches into the water through several pathways. Corrosive products in the water such as acids eat away at the pipes and do so to older alloys more quickly.  You also have selectively leaching where in one element within an alloy leaches out more than another element. Lead is more likely to leach out than copper but less likely than zinc.  And the different pipes within the city<sq>s system can form galvanic cells if the water has ionic properties.  <br><br>The detroit water system adds phosphates into the water to force lead oxide to form on any pipes that contain lead.

In the past, when the Flint river water was used, it wasn<sq>t used long enough to degrade the lead oxide coating on the city<sq>s water pipes but over months it did so.  Thus the lead levels started off a bit higher and then took off. <br><br>Anytime you change water supplies, federal regulations require regular testing of the water. While adding phosphates isn<sq>t required, there are limits to the lead concentration. At a certain level, you must mitigate, of which phosphates is one option.  <br><br>Flint has switch back to Detroit water and, in effect, now has phosphates back in the water. But that oxide layer was built up over decades. Its going to take awhile to rebuild it in all the pipes. In addition, you have to move a lot of water through the pipes to get the phosphates into them. That water is expensive and unsafe, so there is reduced water movement through the pipes and reduced ability to rebuild the lead oxide layer.<br><br>One thing that will come out of this I am sure is an update to water standards. Its seems obvious the federal requirements were inadequate when determining water sources for Flint. Changes will also be coming in water testing methods and best practices.</p>",

The key to test here is the basic geometry and any unique components for practicality. You might machine parts out of plastic, or just mock it up with cardboard and ducktape. This isn<sq>t a prototype, so much, as a quick physical model of your simulation so you can get a better feel for your design.<br><br>- Prototype(s)<colon> At this point you want to get a build that will work just like your final design. You might substitute some of the more expensive components for cheaper equivalents or build something at a smaller/larger scale when practical, but the big key here is testing functionality and interfacing with the outside world.<br><br>- Pre-Production/Sample Run<colon> At this point you should have 99<percent> of all possible errors covered, so you<sq>re ready to try and make a small batch of your final product to check the effects of anything you glossed over in the prototype.  <br><br>All of these phases are of course optional and can be combined or repeated multiple times depending on the complexity and room for error with your project. If your 3D printing a pin holder, it<sq>s probably not worth your time to do a mock-up and a prototype. If you<sq>re working on a new shuttle design for SpaceX you<sq>re going to do all of this and more before you even consider a test launch. <br><br>One final note, everyone always fucks up their first design.

                "answer": "<p>Civil engineer here, here<sq>s what I believe is happening. The glass stairs were designed as cantilevers as the main problem if you ask me would be the cables stretching. The cables I believe are more for show and to stop people falling off the stairs. The reason why I came to this conclusion is because the stairs appear to be anchored to the walls, and if you were at the top floor walking down, the second you step on one step you would cause it to slightly deform a bit perhaps lets say 1mm (I<sq>m just guessing here), now this deformation now causes the cable to relax a bit and the step on the floor below might now only be supported by it<sq>s anchor to the wall. If you have enough load on the steps, you might cause a large deflection. Furthermore if someone was on the bottom most steps, his load would be transferred to the wall by the step he is standing on as well as through the cable to the [step above him](http<colon>//imgur.com/ejFIWOF). So we can conclude that the best way to make this stairs system work would be to anchor all the steps to the walls and allow the cables to just go through the stairs without taking any load.<br><br>Regarding your second question well even if the cables were taking load the beam that is supporting them would still have to be designed specially. If it was a steel beam then the cables would have to be welded or bolted to the beam. If the beam was concrete then perhaps bolted or if the load was too great, then anchored. The beam would still have to be designed for whatever loads the cables are taking anyway.<br><br>If you have anymore questions please don<sq>t hesitate to ask.

That is one of the reasons that the current wave of new plants were commissioned in the US.  Because gas is so cheap now, there are 3 nuke plants recently shut down and three more in jeopardy.  It is a fool<sq>s bargain.  The cheap gas will last another 20-30 years and then the US will have nothing to replace them.  Coal is out due to climate change issues and wind and solar are too intermittent for use as base load power (another argument for another time).<br><br>Check out some of the pro-nuclear sites like NEI (the industry trade group) and ANS (the industry professional organization) for career and industry information.  You can do a BS in ME and an MS or MEng in NE.  It<sq>s done all of the time. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Did you ever want to be a superhero when growing up? <br><br>Humanity is facing a crisis. Many don<sq>t accept it, but it<sq>s the unfortunate reality. To stave off disaster without drastically diminishing quality of life, we need stable, reliable, controllable, economical, and most importantly *scalable* sources of low carbon energy. Fossil fuels have to go. Now. And that<sq>s a tough pill to swallow in many places.  <br><br>There are few options for low carbon energy. Of these, nuclear and biomass best fit what we need, and the two play off their strengths and weaknesses together quite well. <br><br>So when I asked if you wanted to be a superhero - nuclear engineering is an opportunity to save humanity in the most direct manner possible for an engineer. You get to be a superhero in the closest manner possible. <br><br>Not only that - many people are frightened of nuclear power. They fear it, so they hate it. But you<sq>ll be doing what is necessary for humanity. Because you<sq>re the ~~hero~~ engineer humanity needs, not the one it deserves. *You<sq>re the goddamn Batman.*<br><br>Silliness aside - there is a nugget of dead serious truth here. I do believe nuclear engineering is a way to directly save humanity. Even on my worst days, remembering this is a great way to stay positive and motivated. That is why I<sq>m passionate about it. Humanity might not deserve saving, might not want saving, but dammit I<sq>m going to save it. <br><br>What are the biggest challenges?  <br><br>Frankly, it<sq>s vendor quality. When they say they don<sq>t make <sq>em like they used to - they aren<sq>t kidding. Everybody else is cutting so many corners and manufacturing such utter trash that it becomes difficult to obtain good quality parts that are going to actually work. <br><br>Secondary to that - these quality problems have ignited elaborate  quality assurance programs to try to catch or counter the garbage from vendors - and it doesn<sq>t bloody work. Why?  Allow me to let the late great Chris Farley tell you [why.](https<colon>//youtube.com/watch?v=mEB7WbTTlu4) Replace <dq>guarantee on the box<dq> with <dq>quality assurance documentation<dq>. <br><br>I believe vertical integration is needed. We need to own our supply chain and design/fabricate a lot of components in-house. It<sq>s something that was done a lot a generation ago, and is verboten today. I believe this is where we may have gone wrong. If you want something done right you need to do it yourself. Insourcing. Not outsourcing. <br><br>The next big issue we are always combating is human performance.  People make mistakes, or worse, intentionally do things they aren<sq>t supposed to do. I believe it is crucial in all aspects, from initial design, all the way to operation, to properly incentivize workers of all stripes to make the right decisions every time, and to arrange work in a manner that minimizes opportunities for error. Easier said than done.<br><br>All in all, it comes down to perfection. We do not accept anything less, whether that<sq>s in quality of materials, or quality of our own work. We hold ourselves to an exceptionally high standard of excellence because failure is simply not an option. We must be the absolute best. </p>",

I work on experiments and numeric modeling of reactor coolant systems.  I<sq>ve done internships at a national lab and a private nuclear engineering company that<sq>s designing a next generation reactor.<br><br>The one thing that keeps me interested in nuclear is it<sq>s potential to help the world.  If you look at nearly any quality of life measure and plot it against per-capita electrical generation, you find a startling, if not too surprising trend - access to electricity = access to a better quality of life.  The one that really got me was infant mortality rate.  Countries with little electrical capacity have a very high number of deaths of infants under 1 year of age.  On the flip side, countries with high electrical capacity have a low infant mortality rate.  A few examples<colon><br><br>* Niger<colon> 17.2 kWh/person; 86.3 deaths under 1 year of age per 1000 births<br>* Chad<colon> 17.5 kWh/person; 90.3 deaths<br>* Afghanistan<colon> 26.2 kWh/person; 117.2 deaths<br>* United States<colon> 12857.5 kWh/person; 6.17 deaths<br>* Canada<colon> 17883.9 kWh/person; 4.71 deaths<br>* South Korea<colon> 9984.1 kWh/person; 3.93 deaths<br><br>Similar trends can be shown for other measures of quality of life - health, education, economic development, etc.<br><br>So, if the world needs electricity to prosper, how should we generate it?  Coal is too dirty.  Natural gas is a little cleaner, but still pretty bad when you consider scaling up production to the entire planet.  Wind and solar are nice, but intermittent and still in their infancy.  Nuclear is the only way to produce clean, abundant, stable electricity.  It<sq>s best, simplest way to bring the most people out of poverty and into the 21st century.<br><br>Right now, many nuclear engineers are older and retiring.  If we really are going to use nuclear to help the world, then we need new engineers to take the baton.  I<sq>m passionate about my work because it really is helping people who need it.  By using nuclear power, we can stop global warming while simultaneously improving the quality of life for most of the planet.<br><br>The challenges ahead?  Waste, obviously.  But this is more of a political obstacle - we can reprocess and we know how to store high level waste safely.  We should also encourage next generation reactors that can burn existing <sq>waste<sq>.  There<sq>s also a bit of a <sq>brain drain<sq> in the industry as people retire.  We need more young people involved to help design new reactors - and that<sq>s where the huge opportunities lie.</p>",

When you scale to mass production you need to reduce the cost to make sure that the overall cost is affordable to the customer and provides the return that the company wants. This means cutting costs by using cheaper heavier materials and looser tolerances. <br>Second is safety. It would be quite simple to make a super light car that gets great gas mileage and make the skin out of Mylar or aluminum foil. But what happens when that rock flies up at 70mph and smacks you in the face. Or how about the 40mph car accident. Crumple zones and protective parts are heavy and reduce mileage. <br><br>Finally we look at comfort. Do you want air conditioning?  How about padded seats?

Although you can calculate how much energy goes in to the car/passenger system, you can<sq>t easily know how much goes in to kinetic energy, how much in to thermal, how much in to crumpling the body, and so on. This makes it near useless for calculating the effect on a passenger. In contrast if you know the change in momentum, you can estimate the acceleration or the force on the passenger, which is what does the damage. In this case if the brakes succeed in holding the car, the acceleration of the passenger is reduced to near zero, reducing the damage to the passenger. In practice, the force at impact is likely to be sufficient to move the car at least a small distance - however a crumple zone will help by reducing the peak force on the car (hence reducing the peak force on the passenger).<br><br>Pragmatically, however, I would agree with /u/zarx, the better reason for keeping the brakes on is to avoid being pushed in to traffic.</p>",

There were a lot of really fun <dq>small company<dq> perks, but over the few years I was there, you could tell they were <dq>trying to compete with the big boys<dq> and kept making changes to be more corporate. I was laid off because they decided they didn<sq>t want to invest in my department....also they had JUST hired 3 engineers into another department and hadn<sq>t even considered moving me over there instead of laying me off. <br><br>Second company was pretty big, and one of the big players in the same market. Not GIANT CORPORATION huge, but still quite big. I worked in a brand new building that I honestly still wish I worked in now. Even though everyone had open workstations instead of offices or cubicles (directors and above had offices, though) I liked that they had little open meeting areas with different puzzles and toys to play with...but I<sq>m a kinesthetic learner and so I always work better when I<sq>m fiddling with things or moving around. They also had cafes on every floor and stuff. It was just nice because the company spent a lot of money on the building...but I felt like a cog in the machine. We didn<sq>t have the personel resources to get anywhere on the project, and I got laid off in less than a year after they combined two major divisions and promised that no one at the lower levels had to be worried about being laid off. A month later they laid off 50+ people, but kept the bloated upper management and middle management structures. <br><br>The job I<sq>m at now is a part of a giant multinational multibillion dollar corporation with divisions in all kinds of different markets. However, the specific location I<sq>m at used to be a different company and was acquired a few years back. While this location is sort of slowly being absorbed into the culture, they<sq>re retaining a lot of the <dq>small company<dq> ideals while being invested in by the larger company. Lots of good updates to the building, relatively good investment in the employees (if I see some kind of training I want to do, my manager almost always approves it for me), and lots and lots of work, making me feel a lot more secure in my position. Hell, I took a huge pay cut to come here because I wanted to stay in town where I lived, and while I<sq>m still a touch grumpy when I think about how much salary I miss out on every year, the people I work with and the work that I do is fulfilling enough that I don<sq>t really mind it. <br><br>So with all that in mind, I<sq>d say that working for a large company that is able to have a small company feel is probably the best kind of place. I<sq>m told many west coast tech companies do that, but it<sq>s less common outside of there. </p>",

This can happen at any stage - during initial design and planning, implementation/construction, or even after everything is finished.  If the majority of the errors that are caught that you have made are found by others then there is a serious, serious problem.  If a junior engineer makes an error and comes forward as soon as feasible (bonus points for confirming the error and process that led to it, and for having a mitigation in mind) it is a great sign to me of their competence and their skill especially if the error had slipped past me or other colleagues first.  If I have to find the error myself then I have to balance that out against everything that person has done and can do.<br><br>Now<colon> be an engineer.  Quantify your mistakes.  Is the material impact to your project(s) of the error(s) significant relative to project costs and profits, and do these errors exist in this same impact across all projects, including the ones you were not working on?  Or, more simply, are you the problem or is this common with or without you involved?<br><br>As for giving up, where is this feeling coming from? Is it a felling of not being good enough (self-esteem issue), a feeling of not being as good as you think you could be (an experience issue), a feeling of helplessness (a lack of control), a directionless feeling (a lack of mentorship), or an actual, quantifiable assessment? There is no shame in changing direction, especially after 3 years in the work force.  Just make sure the feeling is coming from logic rather than immediate circumstance.

If you come in on Monday and it<sq>s done, then great.  If not, then you deal with it then.

A 60 watt lightbulb consumes 60 watts of electricity and radiates most of this- some as visible light, most as infrared.<br><br>The tube of a compact fluorescent light gets fairly hot - about 200F (100C). The mercury vapor inside the tube works just fine at this temperature and the phosphor becomes only slightly less efficient at this temperature. The large surface area of the tube means the heat is conveyed to the air around the bulb by convection. CFLs also have an circuit board in the base (the <sq>ballast<sq>) which can be damaged by heat. If you put a CFL in a fixture with poor airflow it can overheat the ballast. The first component to fail in the ballast is usually an electrolytic capacitor or transistor. A 60 watt equivalent CFL consumes 13W. 1W is lost in the ballast and heats it. 2W is lost heating the electrodes in the part of the tube next to the circuit board. 3W is radiated out as visible light. The remaining 7W are lost in the tube and heat the surrounding air by convection.<br><br>The LEDs in an LED lamp also gets fairly hot- also about 200F. However unlike the CFL tube they are very small- something like 10mm^2 total. With this little surface area the LEDs would have to be thousands of degrees to radiate or convect the 7 watts or so of heat they produce. So instead they conduct the heat out to a package and from there to a heatsink. Heatsinks are designed to convect the most heat possible for their size.</p>",

This is known as the [Meredith effect](https<colon>//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_effect).  While this was not unique to the P-51, IIRC, the designers pulled it off exceptionally well.<br><br>If you look at images of the P-51 from the side, and follow along the bottom of the fuselage, in the rear 1/3 or so of the fuselage, [you may see a flap that sometimes appears](https<colon>//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_P-51_Mustang#/media/File<percent>3AP-51_WV_ANG.jpeg) and [sometimes doesn<sq>t](https<colon>//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_P-51_Mustang#/media/File<percent>3AP-51D_Urban_Drew.jpg). That is the exhaust duct.  The duct geometry changes as conditions warrant, with the result that a huge amount of drag is offset by the thrust generated by the Meredith Effect.<br><br>There were many ways to reduce drag, and the P-51 used as many as it could.  It<sq>s no accident that many of the fastest ever Unlimited Class air racers start with P-51s (Vodoo, Dago Red, Strega, Precious Metal, Red Baron, Stiletto, etc).</p>",

To answer your questions as best as possible, in a modern vehicle the throttle is typically linked to a torque <dq>target<dq> so a change in throttle position will demand more or less torque. Most ECUs and TCUs (engine control unit and transmission control unit) are torque based these days. What does that mean exactly?<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Your ECU has a series of maps, 2D or 3D which are used to control various operating parameters. So given a set of independent variables (torque demanded, speed, wheel slip, slip angle, acceleration, or any number of other things) there is a table which correlates to the dependent variable (in this particular case we are talking about a fuel mixture). Now each one of these maps are interrelated. Imagine a giant block diagram except each block is a table (in fact Matlab and Simulink are often used in newer  ECUs or at a more base level C++).<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>So what is this doing with your actual throttle? Wel, depending on your vehicle it could be many things. You could have a throttle on each cylinder even. But basically it is setting a fuel/air mixture target. Typically this is near stoichiometric ratio or slightly lean. Now, depending on the situation any number of things could also be changing such as cylinder deactivation, a change in spark timing, injection timing, duration of injection, valve timing, or dozens of other things.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>So at a most basic level, you are demanding a torque with a throttle pedal, the actual throttle and fuel injectors are working together to supply the engine with the appropriate ratio and amount of air and fuel to deliver that torque.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>In a carbureted engine, pressing the gas pedal down doesn<sq>t let more fuel in[directly]. It lets more air in. As the pistons go down on their intake stroke, they create a low pressure vacuum that pulls air from the atomosphere. Restricting the flow, however, is the butterfly valve in the carb. The more you press the pedal, the more it opens, and the more air it can pull through. So where does the gas come from? There is a nozzle sticking out into the airflow in the carb that has fuel in it. As the air rushes past this downward facing nozzle, it creates a low pressure zone just below the nozzle. That low pressure zone sucks the gas out of the line. The more air flowing, the more fuel it pulls. Note there is no main fuel pump. There is a small one that pushes a dribble of gas, but most of the pump is done by carb suction.<br><br>Now with fuel injection, there are varying degrees of mechanical and computer involvement. There are also varying degrees of how much the computer can change on the fly depending on acceleration request. Older OBDII cars have cable-actuated throttle bodies; the gas pedal pulls a cable that pulls the butterfly valve open to allow more air through. Newer cars have a sensor in the pedal that relays the pedal position to motor in the throttle body, telling it to move to the corresponding position. Both setups usually have <dq>Throttle position sensors<dq> on the butterfly valve that then tells the computer (PCM, ECM, ECU, etc) how to control fuel, spark, and sometimes valve timing. Electronically controlled transmissions are also affected, moreso than vacuum controlled units<br><br>There is a fuel pump that does all of the fuel pumping work. It pumps gas into the fuel lines and into each fuel injector, and maintains high pressure (40-80psi) to supply enough fuel at high RPM and high load. The ECU controls each individual injector and actuates each injector<sq>s solenoid at the appropriate time to spray that ~60psi fuel. When you switch from cruising at 20<percent> throttle to 90<percent> throttle, the computer can open the solenoid sooner and keep it open for longer to spray more gas. <br><br>The computer can also change when the spark occurs. If you want more power, you advance the spark, meaning it sparks earlier, to allow more time for combustion. <br><br>On vehicles equipped with variable timing (VTEC, Ti-VCT, VVT, etc), the computer or engine changes the camshaft in some way to open the intake valves sooner and/or for longer. Some cars do change the exhaust cam (if DOHC), but it<sq>s not as common. Older systems use the increased oil pressure at high rpm (high rpm > oil pump spins faster > maintains higher pressure > moves something with oil pressure), but newer systems tend to have electronic setups or independent hydraulic systems. <br><br>Those are the main things that happen when you press the fun pedal. When you press it, the computer says <dq>user wants more power<dq> and adjusts accordingly. It<sq>s not really specifically asking for horsepower, torque, or revs, as they are all directly tied together. You just want more of everything. <br><br>When it comes to the transmission, older automatics just used the amount of vacuum from the engine to determine what it needs to do. Less vacuum/~-3psi means shift as low as you can for the given output speed. High vacuum/~-15psi means go as high as you can. Vacuum pressure seems backwards, but the vacuum lines are attached between the carb and the cylinders. The more open the throttle, the more air can freely flow, the lower the pressure. Engines are in a constant state of suffocation by nature, as the pressure in the cylinders has to be lower than atmospheric (neglecting boosted engines) to pull the air in. With electronically controlled transmissions, there is no vacuum line. The ECU reads the gas pedal and vehicle speed, then shifts accordingly. Newer cars can put you into <dq>sport<dq> mode, so to speak, for a bit just based on the gas pedal. When you floor it, the ECU can lock the transmission in lower gears to keep your rpm/power availability up, even after you let up on the pedal. In racing/spirited driving, it<sq>ll keep it in lower gears for a few seconds after you floor it to avoid shuffling a 5>3>4>3 shift and just keep it in 3rd a bit longer. Sportier cars have actual Sport buttons to stay this way. IIRC the Porsche Panamera I drove kept the RPMs over 3000 when engaged, but kept shift times to a minimum by not needing the superfluous upshifts in the first place.</p>",

I haven<sq>t actually looked at the numbers, but if you divide the cost of the program by three, I doubt it<sq>s still the most expensive weapons program in history. So, I bet the cost problems are exaggerated to some extent because journalists never actually know what they<sq>re talking about.<br><br>Multi-role doesn<sq>t really overload a modern fighter with too many requirements, but trying to be three different jets at once clearly does. There are just too many compromises that have to be made in order to keep some semblance of part interchangeability between the different versions.<br><br>As far as performance, I think the main problem is that the <dq>all-stealth air force<dq> idea is a stupid one. Stealth is great, but it<sq>s more of a niche technology. For instance, a stealth air superiority fighter is a great idea. A stealth deep strike or SEAD aircraft is also a great idea. However, stealth makes a lot less sense for a lot of ground-attack missions, and pretty much no sense for CAS. <br><br>The design constraints placed on the F-35 by the stealth design prevent it from being as good at these roles as people expected it to be. It simply can<sq>t carry enough stuff internally to be able to do missions the same way the F-16 or F-18 can. Those are more successful as multi-role aircraft because you can load them very heavily for a strike mission, or load them more lightly for an air superiority mission. The F-35 had to be designed lightly for the air superiority mission, but then fattened so it had a prayer of doing ground-attack. But because of the stealth restrictions, it can<sq>t do a very good job of that mission. So it ends up being an all-round turd.<br><br>The other problem is the classic American acquisitions problem of asking for the moon. They decide to include all these nonexistent technologies as key features of the new aircraft. You end up with a hybrid production-design/research project. Research projects always take longer than you expect, which means going over-budget. But now you<sq>re doing your research on a full production scale, which means instead of spending $4 million when you thought it would be $2 million, those numbers start with a <sq>b<sq>. The fact that you<sq>re doing this with not just one technology, but 20, and trying to make all these brand-new things work together at the same time, means you<sq>re fucked for sure. There<sq>s just no way to do that without it turning into a disaster. We really need to do more small-scale research at high TRL before we decide to include this stuff in front-line hardware.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I work in government as an engineer, and I used to be in the private sector. My experience is in municipal government and although you didn<sq>t say, I can tell your experience is not at the local governmental level. Nevertheless I think I can share some insights. My thoughts are general reactions to what you<sq>ve written. My numbering doesn<sq>t match yours, by the way.<br><br>1. Unfortunately, there is waste at all levels of government. Some people don<sq>t carry their weight and apparently don<sq>t feel guilty about it. Agencies try to combat this through good hiring practices, for example trying to get self-starters. But bad apples get through and they can be hard to deal with, especially if they<sq>re good at covering their asses. This doesn<sq>t make it okay though.<br>2. The best way to maintain a tidy ship is to hire competitively, to make sure everyone feels like they got to where they are based on merits. This applies to both outside hires and in-house promotions. Hiring on other characteristics (e.g. <dq>does he like beer,<dq> to use your example) is organizational poison and is a good reason for the well-qualified to stay away or leave.<br>2. The farther removed you are from constituents, the less accountable you become.<br>3. Salary scales are inviolate. Staff only has authority to pay you what the salary scale allows. Over time, scales can be adjusted to stay competitive, but for a given offer the only latitude the other side has is which step to bring you in on.<br>4. One trade-off between private and public sectors is time. In the private sector, your measure is how much work you<sq>re getting done; and if your work is under control you can leave early. But if you<sq>re behind, you have to stay late. In government, it<sq>s the opposite<colon> You can go home on time, but you have to stay until closing time. This is for a variety of reasons but the most practical reason is that others in the organization may need to collaborate with you and to collaborate you have to be available. (Municipal government workers also have to service the public, another reason we can<sq>t leave early.) I didn<sq>t realize how important collaboration was until I joined the public sector. But that<sq>s another topic for another day.<br>6. Said trade-off tends to favor people in the middle of their career, when they have families and want a predictable schedule. I have little ones and I like being able to go home to see them every day. I didn<sq>t care about that when I was single, and I won<sq>t care when they<sq>re off to college. But for now I like where I am and it<sq>s a big reason for putting up with some of the disadvantages of being in government. In the meantime I get to do some pretty neat things where I work.<br>7. Government rewards mediocrity. It<sq>s unfortunate but true. As long as you<sq>re doing the minimum to get by, you get to keep your job; and work over and above the minimum is not rewarded. Granted, you won<sq>t (or shouldn<sq>t) get promoted if you<sq>re just getting by, but it<sq>s still a good gig for those who succumb to the temptation.<br><br>I encourage you and anyone else reading this to fight against complacency in the government workplace. Taxpayers deserve better. There is nothing wrong with leaving; in fact, if you state this as a major contributing factor in your exit interview, you will help push the organization toward change. And leaving and coming back later in your career, when you may be able to exert more will over the organization due to having more responsibility, is another way to make a difference.<br><br>One final note, I feel I<sq>ve barely scratched the surface of my thoughts on this matter. I may have more to add later if there are questions. But for now it<sq>s time to wrap up my lunch break by actually eating something.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The big question is why *would* we use them? By that I don<sq>t mean <sq>what wonderful things might thorium fueled reactors be able to do?<sq> but <sq>what specific problems are there that would push us in the direction of thorium as a solution?<sq><br><br>Before going further, it<sq>s important to distinguish between thorium as a fertile material that could be used as a fuel and the various advanced reactor concepts that have been proposed to use thorium. Many of the claimed advantages of thorium are really advantages of molten salt reactors, and many of the commonly stated disadvantages (e.g. corrosion by salt) are also specific to these reactors. Uranium-fueled molten salt breeder reactors are also possible. The MSR thing is really a different question though as these reactors don<sq>t currently exist for any fuel cycle and are the subject of active research and development.<br><br>With that out of the way, we<sq>re left with existing reactor designs<colon><br> <br>* LWRs<colon> thorium can be used in these and was used in Shippingport, which demonstrated net breeding. However, this requires the use of highly enriched uranium (U233) which is a proliferation hazard and reprocessing is challenging. With uranium cheap and abundant there is little reason to use thorium.<br><br>* HTGRs<colon> thorium was used in most prototype/demonstration HTGRs including Fort St Vrain and the THTR. Despite safety advantages, these never caught on for various reasons (badly designed plants, politics, lack of operational experience, incompatible regulatory systems etc). Thorium fuels also had the previously mentioned issues of proliferation risk due to HEU and the lack of any economic driver, so the consensus shifted to using LEU in HTGRs.<br><br>* Heavy water reactors<colon> the main users of these are Canada and India. Canada has huge quantities of high grade uranium ore so little reason to use anything else. In principle thorium can be used quite effectively though. India has lots of thorium and is pursuing a strategy based around HWRs making extensive use of thorium, alongside fast breeder reactors and some LWRs using imported fuel.<br><br>* Sodium cooled fast reactors<colon> they can use thorium, but they can also breed using uranium, and as fast reactors the ability to breed with thermal neutrons is irrelevant. Most of the fuel cycle advantages attributed to thorium reactors also exist for uranium-fuelled fast breeders.<br><br>Most of the Cold War era uranium fuel cycle plants (especially enrichment plants) which did originally enable the use of uranium-fueled LWRs have now closed and been replaced with modern plants using different technologies. Uranium has the fundamental advantage that it naturally contains a fissile isotope that can be extracted without any reprocessing and (now) enriched easily to any desired level so it gives tremendous flexibility - HEU can be used in subs that never need refuelling, while LEU enables cheap, proliferation-resistant fuel for power reactors, all without any processes that require particularly complex chemistry or extensive radiation shielding. Where reprocessing is desired, it<sq>s much easier to do with uranium - mostly this is because we already have the technology and partly it<sq>s down to more difficult chemistry with thorium.<br><br>Given all that, there just isn<sq>t really any strong reason to switch. There<sq>s plenty of uranium, it<sq>s cheap and it<sq>s easy to turn into a wide range of useful nuclear fuel types that we have a lot of experience with. There<sq>s a constant drive to make new reactors safer, but plenty of ways of doing this using uranium-fueled designs and few advantages that are unique to thorium. Finally, while uranium enrichment and reprocessing facilities can potentially be used to produce weapons, there is no need ever to get close to producing weapons grade material in a civilian fuel cycle and we are very good at monitoring and controlling this so it<sq>s near very hard to go down the path of making weapons without the international community knowing about it. Obviously that doesn<sq>t stop North Korea from doing their own thing anyway, but neither would the existence of thorium reactors. The effective use of thorium in existing plant designs and most proposed advanced reactors also opens a whole range of new proliferation challenges which do not yet have full solutions. I<sq>m sure the technical and regulatory developments could be made to allow these fancy fuel cycles to work safely, but it would be expensive and a bit pointless while uranium is available.</p>",

[This PDF](http<colon>//dougkerr.net/pumpkin/articles/Split_Prism.pdf) goes into more detail.<br><br>A neat thing about phase detection is that instead of having to find focus via trial and error like contrast detection, the camera can compute exactly how out of focus the lens is. It can then send the lens directly to proper focus at high speed, without having to stop and check for focus all along the way.<br><br>There is a third way of focusing worth mentioning<colon> direct distance measurement, e.g. with infrared light or ultrasonic pulses. These methods are uncommon in general purpose cameras, but they do work. They tend to be foiled by windows and dark/acoustically absorbing subjects and are prone to calibration errors since the camera has no way of knowing if the subject is actually in focus.</p>",

Common one is to have prime number of tooth in the smaller gear of gear set, then the larger gear can have any number of tooth that is not multiple of that prime. This way every teeth of the small gear is going to touch every teeth of the larger gear before it touches the fist one again. That means the gears are going to wear out very evenly, and they fit together better after some use.<br><br>Thirdly you don<sq>t always need that good accuracy, but consistency instead. Large part of modern accuracy juggling is just to make assembly easy and fast at an assembly line. If you can settle for consistency, you can often use wedges or cones to place your stuff approximately where it should be, but it<sq>s going to fall almost perfectly to same place over and over again.</p>",

It hits the Kantrowitz choking limit for ducted airflow almost instantaneously.<br><br>If the breach is behind the pod, it<sq>s really no big deal.  It<sq>s already moving at or near that speed already, so relative velocity is 20-40 m/s or so.  What happens is that the air density around the pod increases, which increases drag, meaning the pod starts slowing.<br><br>It<sq>s the breach ahead of the pod that<sq>s an issue.  Assuming you have sensors every 100 meters or so, it<sq>s more or less a given that the signal can get to the pod and it can brake at 9g<sq>s (FAA emergency braking for 14 CFR part 25 aircraft) for 4 seconds and get to a dead stop long before the pressure wave propagates backwards.<br><br>So that makes the relative velocity Mach 1 instead of Mach 1.9.  Now let<sq>s talk stopped distance from the breach.  Anything over 2 km and you<sq>ve lost 95<percent> of the overpressure already.  This is because you effectively have a compressed air pipeline now, and you can calculate that kind of pressure loss [here](http<colon>//www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pressure-drop-compressed-air-pipes-d_852.html).  Think of it kind of like head pressure in a hydraulic or pumped system.<br><br>That leaves short distances, where there isn<sq>t enough time for the shockwave to slow.  The exact pressure we<sq>re talking about are impossible to predict without knowing the diameter of the tube, the bypass area (some hyperloop pod designs have 1/4 the diameter of the tube, meaning they only block 6<percent> of the area!), the pressure of the tube, etc.  However, you can make an educated guess that the overpressure is going to be a little over 16 psi (atmospheric is 14.7, plus the velocity of the shockwave).  Is it fatal?  Maybe.  It<sq>s a nearly instantaneous impact, though, and crumple zones can actually deal with that fairly effectively.  G-load would be based on the actual pod diameter, but if it<sq>s ~1.5 meters across, masses 15,000 kg (whitepaper value for passenger pod), then you<sq>ve got an instantaneous acceleration of 5.3g on a vehicle that<sq>s more or less an aircraft without wings.

At most the system might be cleaned by a jet-vacuum truck. This truck sends a long hose into a pipe from a manhole and then uses high pressure water to pull any debris in the pipe back to the manhole, which is then sucked up with a vacuum into a tank on the truck. However, this type of work is typically only done when there is a problem and the system is backing up or when the pipes are being evaluated for replacement.<br><br>Beyond cleaning, the only other option is to replace the pipe. Most of the sewage systems I<sq>ve seen being replaced are the in the 50-100 year old range, and these were usually made out of either clay, brick, or asbestos. If the system is being replaced, the two ways it is commonly being done right now are either dig up and relay with new pipe or cured-in-place pipe lining (CIPP). If the system needs to be up-sized to accommodate more flow than it was originally designed for or the existing pipe is in really bad shape then the pipe will be dug up and relaid with new pipe, which will usually be either PVC, ductile iron, or concrete. If the existing pipe is in decent shape, then a lot of places are now going with CIPP lining, which does not requiring any digging of city streets. This is a process of pushing a sock-like tube that has been soaked in a type of resin through a pipe with water or steam pressure, the water or steam is then heated to cook the resin which hardens in place adhering to the existing pipe walls. For practical purposes, it is like putting a brand new pipe inside of the old one.</p>",

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that design engineering is usually isolated from manufacturing - in my current company all design engineers work at a facility 1,000 miles away from my plant.  <br><br>Being chastised for the smallest thing is sometimes because a little mistake can cause a BIG problem for other departments, causing more work for them, rework, frustration, etc.  It<sq>s frustrating to try and write programs to machine parts where you have things like GD&T used for tolerances when its not really necessary as well as general style mistakes which make the drawing hard to read.<br><br>My best advice for you to help remedy this (if it is possible) is get to know the manufacturing shop you are designing product for, learn what their capabilities are and get in touch with the engineers that support the shop.  Be open when they have suggestions for changes to product that might help improve manufacturability, give them a heads up when you have something new about to be released that needs special attention because of the constraints that you were under as you design it.  <br><br>Trust me, if you can develop a good relationship with the people who are using your drawings, it will benefit both yourself and them!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I don<sq>t know where you got fatigue from, considering that the rest of your post talks about heat annealing the barrel which would eliminate fatigue. Second, you<sq>re confusing your ratings and measurements. <br><br>>The steel grade for full auto weapons is typically 4140. (It seems to be very consistent here.) But you need very specific heat treatment to get even close to 1800MPa.<br><br>Your calculations and comparisons are all wrong. I couldn<sq>t figure out an easy way to explain all the ways you are wrong, so I<sq>ll redo all your work and answer any questions.<br><br>First, let<sq>s start with the chamber pressure, this will be different based of caliber and powder load, and cannot be generalized. Your pressure number of 400MPa = 58k psi because I like metric but I use psi way more. This is a fairly reasonable middle of the road pressure for smokeless, so this number checks out.<br><br>I<sq>ve never heard of a lame function and wikipedia wasn<sq>t helpful, so I<sq>m going to use the hoop stress formulas I normally use as an engineer. There are two different kinds of hoop stress, thin wall and thick wall. I<sq>m going to start with the thick wall calculations.<br><br>>With Lame function and relatively thick barrel you get about 1,5 times higher hoop stress at the inner surface.<br><br>This is completely wrong, because hoop stress depends on the barrel inner diameter and thickness. The thick wall hoop stress calculation is as follows<colon> stress = (pressure * inner diameter) / ( 2* wall thickness)<br><br>A little google search tells me that for an average .223 ar15 barrel has a standard small thickness of .5in. Now that we have all our numbers let<sq>s plug this all into the formula. (58ksi * 0.223in)/(2*((0.5in - 0.223in)/2)) =  46ksi or 320MPa.<br><br>This is right around the yield limit of your average annealed mild steel, and under the 68ksi yield strength of ANNEALED 4140 steel. This would not be acceptable, as it is below the fatigue strength, and the strength would also go down as the barrel heats up. <br><br>HOWEVER! We failed to take two things into account. First, the maximum pressure of only experienced by the first inch or so of the barrel past the casing, as the pressure rapidly goes down due to expansion of the gas. Second, barrels aren<sq>t made the same thickness for the whole length. Almost all barrels are thicker at the start and then taper down their length. This throws our initial barrel thickness right out the window.<br><br>OKAY! Now that we have learned us some new knowings, lets try that formula again. Using google image search for ar15 barrel thickness once again, I pulled a common barrel thickness at the neck of the round of 1.0in. Plugging this back into the hoop stress formula gives us<colon>  (58ksi * 0.223in)/(2*((**1.0**in - 0.223in)/2)) = 17ksi or 115MPa. This cuts the stress down by a third! This makes the safety factor for annealed 4140 steel around 4, which is fairly good, even taking into account fatigue strength and higher temperatures. <br><br>Okay, while I could do all the calculations and lookup tables to account for increased barrel temperature and fatigue strength, but I<sq>m a little too lazy for that. So I<sq>m going to assume that those factors add up to that previously 4x safety factor bieng a little too close for comfort. So, instead of using annealed 4140 steel, we are going to quench and temper it. Suddenly our 68ksi steel becomes 140ksi yield strength (965MPa). This steel was oil quenched and tempered at 1000f (540c) for 30 minutes. <br><br>Now let<sq>s deal with the idea that the heat would ruin the heat treat. 1000f is not the temperature of the quench, it is the temperature of the temper, so that would establish the upper bound on temp. Longer tempering time would only result in a maximum strength reduction of <10<percent>. But, 1000f is **HOT**, like, really hot. You can literally touch the barrel to things to light them on fire and it still won<sq>t ruin the heat treatment. Your barrel will also be radiating so much heat that two things will happen. First, you will no longer be holding the rest of the weapon without third degree burns. Second, it<sq>s going to lose heat to radiation and convection VERY fast and go down to a more reasonable 500f range. The other mechanical parts of your automatic weapon will fail long before your barrel gets this hot / hot enough to fail/sag. Also, these temperatures will be igniting the powder in your bullets by itself, so you have a third reason why you won<sq>t be getting the barrel this hot.<br><br>Man, this was a long post.

                "answer": "<p>There is always a lot of misinformation on this topic. I think /u/BigBrainMonkey said it best in this thread. I recently attained a job in industry after graduating with a PhD in ME with a focus on mechanics of materials. So, my experience is related to the types of positions for that field.<br><br>First of all, let<sq>s focus on why you want to get the PhD. You *do not* get a PhD because you think it<sq>s going to open up a world of possibilities in that everyone will want to hire you. You get a PhD because you love working on very difficult specific problems which have very likely not even been attempted before. You also like to get to a fundamental understanding behind these problems. You can see how this description aligns perfectly with research. It also opens up a world outside of research pertaining to the most difficult technical challenges an industry or company might encounter.<br><br>So, where you work after finishing the PhD? There are 3 primary areas as I see it<colon> (1) academia, (2) national labs, and (3) industry.<br><br>* Academia - teaching and research. Currently, it is very difficult to get a tenure-track academic position. The upside of academia is you define your own work and collaborate with some of the best minds in a subject area. The downside is become a glorified program manager immediately - you don<sq>t do most of the work, your students do. You are also constantly fighting for funding. Also, normally before you can get a tenure track position you need to complete a 2-3 year stint as a post-doc.<br>* National Lab - research and project work. The work at national labs is fairly varied but you still get to do research-type work. Most national labs require you to enter as a post-doc and then offer you a full-time position as a staff scientist after 1-2 years depending on appointment and the specific lab. The downside is many of these jobs require a security clearance so it<sq>s limited to US citizens. The culture at different labs varies greatly and no one is the same as another, e.g., LLNL is very different from ORNL.<br>* Industry - almost all project work. One professor I know has said the age of true industrial research is gone, which in reality is not a bad thing. There are many good and bad things that people have hinted at in this thread. To be honest, this is the area I am least familiar with at this point, but I<sq>ll go through some points that I have been brought up by others and what I can say from my experience and the experience of the many PhDs I know who went to work in industry. It<sq>s important to note when looking at positions in industry you should take not of some advice I was given by an acquaintance at the NRC. In more or less words<colon> <dq>I don<sq>t hire PhDs for what they currently know and what their academic research topic was. I hire them because the PhD is effectively a license to solve very difficult, ill-defined problems which have no prior answer and push the bounds of current engineering knowledge.<dq> <br><br>I<sq>ll try and go through some things about industry<colon><br><br>* <dq>You are too qualified for most positions and your opportunities are limited<dq> - This is absolutely 100<percent> true. You are too qualified for most positions and because of that you have limited your opportunities. But, let<sq>s assume you got your PhD for the right reasons - research/advanced development oriented work. So, do you really want those jobs? Do you really want to do the normal BS qualified test engineer position? It<sq>s not a knock on those positions at all, you just have to make sure you get the PhD knowing full well that you want to do <dq>research-type<dq> work. So, even if you were able to get those jobs on an equal playing field, you wouldn<sq>t want to do them anyways.<br>* <dq>In my experience, mostly heavy industries, outside of advanced development and research there very few PhDs around<dq> - This is again absolutely true. Why would a company want to pay the premium that a PhD demands when they can have someone with a BS or MS do the same work just as effectively. The PhD holds its weight in positions which are normally highly analytical or computational heavy. Projects or areas that would require more specific training and in-depth knowledge. This is what your PhD gives you, the knowledge to solve these very difficult problems. The PhD also says that you can effectively self-teach yourself very difficult new topics. This is what you did during your dissertation research, is it not? You taught yourself to the edge of knowledge of a very specific topic. This has shown you can do this and could do it again.<br>* <dq>Be commissioned and trusted to develop entirely new methods, or technologies<dq> - Again, this absolutely true. As I just said above, you know how to push the edge of the unknown.<br>* <dq>Many employers will be afraid to hire you for fear of you leaving when you realize you are making the same as your BS/MS counterparts<dq> - If you encounter this, then you<sq>re looking in the wrong places. The places that know they need PhDs will know what they<sq>re looking for and won<sq>t be afraid to hire a PhD. You<sq>ll also be paid appropriate for the PhD. There are websites which list the starting salaries of PhDs in different fields, etc. I know the average starting salary of an ME PhD is right around $90k, with that going up or down based on industry and location. The average starting post-doc at a national lab is around $72k, I believe. Is it going to be harder to find a job? Significantly harder but that<sq>s because there<sq>s significantly less of them available which are appropriate for you.<br>* <dq>NASA and JPL have position that require at least a masters. Some even require a phd.<dq> - These are effectively the positions you<sq>re looking at when you<sq>re looking for jobs. Look around at the jobs postings at most large companies including JPL, SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed, GM, GE, etc. You<sq>ll see a decent number of positions that are MS required, PhD preferred (note, they even have a decent number of 0 year experience entry level positions with these requirements). A majority of these positions will be computationally focused - think FEA and CFD. Look around at these to get a sense of the jobs that are available to PhDs.<br>* <dq>You go for industries which look for a specific qualification and there are some of them in which is easier to go up in the <sq>ranking<sq> thanks to a Ph.D.<dq> - This is the last point I wanted to make. By having a PhD, you no longer have a ceiling on the technical track at most companies. You<sq>ll notice the more senior technical positions will start requiring MS and PhD. Also, these positions are significantly more saturated with PhDs than at the less senior levels.<br><br>I hope this helps some.

You will learn the practices and methods used by your community, and you will develop the ability to learn independently and to blaze a path into some unknown territory. You will most likely find yourself taking additional classes, but that<sq>s only to round out your skill set and because, when you only have one or two at a time, classes are a lot of fun. <br><br><br>Because a PhD is meant to train you to do research, the job you should be looking for is a job in research. This is obviously found in acacemia, but only 30-40<percent> of engineering PhDs pursue this route. Most engineering PhDs find positions doing research for the government (Los Alamos, NREL, NIST, etc.) start-ups, or big corporate research labs. I take issue with the idea that a PhD reduces your employment opportunities. While there is some truth to this, it misses the point - the people that say this don<sq>t work with a lot of PhDs. It may be true in their work environment, but the person with the PhD is also less likely to want these jobs. If you want a PhD and are going to make the commitment to get it, you are probably seeking a job that explicitly requires it. <br><br><br>Kind of off topic, but one downside of this is that you can actually become quite isolated from the <dq>real world.<dq> Whether you are in academia or government or industry, PhDs tend to work jobs that require a PhD and where many of your colleagues also have a PhD. Just as these employment opportunities are invisible to the engineer in industry, the real world of engineering can seem far away when you realize that all of your friends and family members also have a PhD, work in the same environment as you, and have the same priorities and lifestyle as you.    </p>",

Give control to one authority, [Let them run simulations](http<colon>//xkcd.com/277/), let me hit a series of green lights. <br><br>B) Use Bypass-local arrangement on highways. Express lanes too. Separation between merge lanes and travel lanes until tractor trailers could reach speed. I<sq>m tired of someone merging 20-40mph under posted speed because the lane is ending, or because they want to get to the fast lane ASAP, and don<sq>t give a shit about anyone else on the road. <br><br>C) Variable speed limits. Flying around at 70 when a huge volume of traffic is merging in leads to slamming on brakes, and stop and go traffic. Point B might take care of some of it, but a road that can handle 60-70mph traffic but is posted 45 because of high volume traffic should be able to go to full speed in off-peak hours. <br><br>D) Increase visibility requirements for any intersection that allows turns on red, and all stop signs. If you can<sq>t see 3-400<sq> down the road to see if it is clear, something needs to be improved  with the intersection. <br><br>E) Butterfly intersections need  improvements. If you<sq>re going north, and exiting to go west, the person merging in who was headed east will share an awkward dance to see who gets to merge first. I don<sq>t know if you need fly-by lanes, but something. <br><br>F) Proceed on flashing red left turns. No need to be stuck until the cycle comes around. Change the sinage from yield because of people that assume green means they should go. Stop, assess if you can go, if you can, go. If you can<sq>t, wait until you can proceed. <br><br>G) Figure out pedestrian/cyclist road use, and give them a place to be away from cars. Especially at merge points. Build them a tunnel/bridge if you have to, I<sq>m just tired of cyclists that decide they own the lane and just swerve into my lane when I<sq>m going twice their speed forcing me to slam on my brakes. <br><br>Actually, an elevated bicycle road in densely populated urban areas would be pretty cool. <br><br>H) ANYWHERE heavy loads will sit needs to be concrete.

Shared space minimises demarcations between vehicles and pedestrians thereby, according to some authorities including the UK Government, reduces the dominance of motor vehicles and enable all users to share the space. In work done for the UK Department for Transport MVA (2010) explains that shared space is a <dq>design approach rather than a design type characterised by standard features<dq>.<br><br>> Hans Monderman suggests that an individuals<sq> behaviour in traffic is more positively affected by the built environment of the public space than by conventional traffic control devices and regulations.<br><br>> A reason for the apparent paradox that reduced regulation leads to safer roads may be found by studying the risk compensation effect.<br><br>> * <dq>Shared space is successful because the perception of risk may be a means or even a prerequisite for increasing objective safety. Because when a situation feels unsafe, people are more alert and there are fewer accidents.<dq><br>> * <dq>We<sq>re losing our capacity for socially responsible behaviour...The greater the number of prescriptions, the more people<sq>s sense of personal responsibility dwindles.<dq> (Der Spiegel quotes Monderman)<br>> * <dq>When you don<sq>t exactly know who has right of way, you tend to seek eye contact with other road users. You automatically reduce your speed, you have contact with other people and you take greater care.<dq><br>> * <dq>To understand how shared space works, it is important to move away from reliance on <sq>rights<sq> and laws, and to recognize the potential for conventions and protocols ... Such conventions and protocols evolve rapidly and are very effective if the state does not intervene through regulation.<dq> (Shared Space Expert Team)<br><br>> The introduction of such schemes have had positive effect on road safety, traffic volume, economic vitality, and community cohesion where a user<sq>s behaviour becomes influenced and controlled by natural human interactions rather than by artificial regulation.<br><br>Every single locale that has implemented shared space has seen an often drastic decline in the number of fatalities, casualties, and accidents.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I finished a PhD in Electrical Engineering in <sq>94 and went to work in industry. Here are my experiences, for what they are worth.<br><br>My first job was with a telecom equipment manufacturer. In the entire department of about 30 people, all but two had PhDs. Those two were internal transfers; all new hires had PhDs. The work was interesting, very analytical and did not make direct use of my PhD at all. Rather, I made use of my ability to handle a big complex analytical problem, break it down into pieces, apply appropriate techniques to each piece to synthesize an answer. One problem a lot of new hires had was scaling their approach according to the time available and the precision required. That was something I was good at so I did well. Strong math and stats were the biggest reason this group hired PhDs.<br><br>After three years in that group I transferred to another group that was much more hands-on. My new manager emphasized that my PhD had no value in that group and I would be reviewed and compensated strictly according to my contributions not my credentials. Fair enough. But my knowledge of stats proved to be invaluable\u2014a co-worker embarrassed our group by presenting test results which the customer immediately recognized as spurious due to lack of statistical significance; I got put on the project and the <dq>difficult<dq> customer was very happy with the revised results.<br><br>Next, I went to work for a very large German telecom equipment maker. Their corporate culture placed a high value on PhDs. I was granted opportunities I wouldn<sq>t have had otherwise and it was great. I was in my prime and did some really good work. I was in a great group of people and had fun. But working for a really big company has some downsides and I wanted to more directly interact with customers and have more say in product design.<br><br>So I left to work for a startup. By this time I had a decade of work experience and the fact I had a PhD was largely irrelevant. And that has been true ever since, although every once in a while I get to trot out my stats or math chops to impress my co-workers.<br><br>Over the years I have worked with many fellow PhD graduates. There are some people who did a PhD because their lack of social and communication skills made it hard to find a job after finishing undergrad. There are some people who think that a PhD certifies them as a higher life form. Most of them are people like me, who are pretty much the same as our non-PhD peers except that we are, as a group, better at stats, math, and handling large problems. And just as some doors will be opened because of a PhD, other times it will be an obstacle because you will be perceived as over-specialized or elitist or ivory tower. The reality is that doing a PhD is a great way to deepen your analytical and problem-solving skills but there are others ways to do that.<br><br>Other people may find work in their specialty. Despite my best efforts that didn<sq>t happen for me so I have never been able to directly use my PhD research in my work. You might get luckier than me, though.</p>",

I<sq>ll try to add some constructive information for you that other people haven<sq>t covered (although a lot of it is good info so far).<br>Interests. A PhD gives you a chance to do things that people without a PhD have to fight harder to do. Whether it<sq>s a good idea or not, I already know in my consulting job that I<sq>m going to get a diverse set of novel and/or complicated problems because of my academic success. If you jump into industry right out of college you<sq>re more likely to get pigeonholed into doing one thing. You become an expert in that thing and have to fight more to branch out. The perception (again, not sure it<sq>s justified, but it exists) is that someone with a PhD doing cookie-cutter work is a waste.<br>Given your interests, and your desire to pursue something cutting edge and applicable, you might find opportunities to do that work in academia or in industry. This is especially true for researchers that study profitable, commercial products that draw interest from industry. In the world of increasingly-difficult-to-get research funds, private-academic partnerships are blossoming. Your interests seem to fit nicely into that mold. The academic work will afford you greater flexibility to study what you want, even if you are taking industry money to study it. You also have the option of developing a research program that does some industry projects, which have more specific deliverables, and fundamental projects funded by research organizations (e.g., NSF, DoE, DoD in the U.S.) that allow you to follow your interests and instincts. The private sector may afford you more resources to pursue what is potentially profitable for the company. More resources generally means a greater likelihood of success, and certainly an easier time pursuing an idea if you can convince your bosses that it<sq>s worth pursuing.<br>Salary. First, don<sq>t do an engineering PhD on your own dime. That<sq>s foolish and unnecessary. If you can<sq>t find funding to do the work you want to do, the market is saying it doesn<sq>t value your research interests or it doesn<sq>t value you. This is good information to have. Embrace it, and get out of academia. If you do find funded research, you<sq>ll probably make 20-30k per year (in the US; may not be comparable to the UK), although there are places that pay above and below that depending on prestige, cost of living, desirable location, etc. Right out of your undergrad, 20-30k per year is usually enough to get by, but your civil engineering peers in industry are making 50-100<percent> more than you are.<br>Second, if you do complete a PhD you will get to choose between academic and industry positions. The salary between these is closer than people make it seem if you get a tenure track position (BIG if). An assistant civil/environmental engineering professor typically makes 60-70k per year for a 9 month appointment, and has to go get funding for two more months to get a full year<sq>s pay (the 12th month is usually unfunded as your <sq>vacation time<sq>). My consulting salary is 85-90k per year. That<sq>s not drastically different from a full-year academic salary. Tenured, full rank professors comfortably make 120k+ for 9 months. What they give up is potential ownership share in a company, stock, and generally higher salaries compared to people in the private sector. In other words, you might leave some money on the table, but you won<sq>t be impoverished by any means.<br>The academic world affords remarkable benefits and schedule flexibility that the private sector doesn<sq>t always allow. One of my academic advisors left every day at 3 pm during little league baseball season to take his son to the batting cages or to practice. The retirement mathching at my postdoc institution was insane<colon> they gave a free 5<percent> match of your salary off the bat and then matched 1<colon>1 for another 5<percent>. In other words, you put in 5<percent> of your salary and got a total of a 15<percent> after matching. Generally speaking, the academic world affords you more flexibility and better benefits in exchange for some salary.<br>Employability. That<sq>s very complicated. My perception searching for industry jobs is that fewer companies are interested in an engineer with a PhD, but the ones that are interested are generally better companies with more interesting work. In other words, commodity firms aren<sq>t interested in people with PhD<sq>s; they just need qualified bodies to crank out work and a PhD doesn<sq>t make you any more qualified for most engineering tasks.<br>People are saying a lot of places just don<sq>t know what to do with an engineer with a PhD. I think that<sq>s essentially correct. I don<sq>t think it<sq>s a coincidence that I was hired by an engineer who also has a PhD. He intrinsically understood that I bring really important soft skills to the table<colon> communication, initiative, project management, problem solving, etc. It<sq>s unlikely you will get hired in industry because of your specific research focus. You have to sell the soft skills as a gateway to success, with your relevant technical skills.<br>My $0.02. Get a PhD. People say you can get one later, but you can<sq>t. Start your career and you will get too comfortable with a real salary. You<sq>ll find a partner, maybe have a kid or something, and the prospect of making 20-30k is pretty unappealing. But making that much as a 23 year old is fine. You<sq>re free to do the awesome PhD things like drink beer in the lab late into the night arguing about the finer details of some esoteric phenomena. You get to become a world expert on something (even if no one else gives a shit about that something). In the long run it opens more doors than it closes. (Disclaimer<colon> I<sq>ve had my doubts about the value of my own PhD and may just be saying that because I want some self-validation.)<br>Good luck to you.

This is especially true in my field (aviation). Pasted here for convenience<colon><br><br>> Your signature is your stamp of approval. When you sign an engineering document, it means that you are qualified both in process (PE license or qualification) as well as technically qualified in that field. You are attesting that the design is adequate, accurate, correct, meets the design requirements, will not cause any impact to public safety, and meets all regulations and requirements.<br>> <br>> This is extremely important to remember. Never ever put your name on something that you can<sq>t back up, no matter how much your management is trying to push it on you to get it done <dq>now<dq>. <br>> <br>> Some big examples. First up, the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant, in 2002, there was an order by the NRC to shut down to inspect their reactor head. All PWRs of certain designs were required to do this, because other plants have discovered severe corrosion and reduction of pressure boundary. Davis-Besse asked the NRC for an extension to do this, and got permission. The NRC granted permission based on the fact that Davis-Besse had a program to inspect for certain types of degradation, that they said the the program was more than adequate to find corrosion like this, and that the most recent inspections have shown no degradation of this type.<br>> <br>> The reality, their program was not effective, the documents were signed off without fully inspecting their reactor head. There were lots of signs they had issues before hand that they missed, for years. When Davis-Besse shut down, their reactor head was missing a football sized chunk of metal. It was down to around 1/16<dq> of an outer stainless steel coating. IF that would have punched through, the plant would have had a medium break LOCA. The manager and engineers involved with this have all been tried for deliberate and willful misconduct, and I know at least one went to jail and a few others are banned from the nuclear industry for life. Those individuals have a huge black mark on their resumes, many cannot get engineering jobs in other fields, and they will likely never hold a security clearance again.<br>> <br>> A personal example I had, was when I was under time crunch to get a plant design change out ASAP to support field work. I was being asked to do it using a procedure exemption that meant I didn<sq>t need a 10CFR50.59 screening. We weren<sq>t actually under that exemption though, and a 50.59 was required. Long story short, I pushed back, told them they won<sq>t get my signature without the 50.59, told them I could have one done in 2-3 hours, and they gave me the time to do it. But these little things, being under a time crunch, having pressures from other things, you cannot let them get in the way of appropriately and properly following processes, regulations, codes, or standards. <br>> <br>> That is how mistakes happen. In this case, the worst that could have happened is that we violated a regulation by not performing the screening, but the design we put in would have passed the screening anyways. So the consequence is regulatory. But being under pressure like this can lead to mistakes which impact your operating objectives, impact your assets and damage equipment, or even worse, affect the health and safety of the public in some way. For example, lets say you work for a company who designs reactor safety grade components, and you had some test anomaly on a component and decided to re-run the test. Then when it passed the second time, you didn<sq>t document the failure. Well later on, as I<sq>m designing a safety system for a nuclear plant, if I use your component I<sq>m going to review all the test documentation to make sure it meets our needs. By not knowing that blip was there, I could put something in that may fail during an extreme service condition that I am counting on it for. One little mishap somewhere may lead to something much worse happening further down the road. No work is so urgent, so important, that we can let engineering standards slip, and your signature is your certification that your design will do what it needs to do.<br>> <br>> That<sq>s my long wall of text.</p>",

However, you need to know a lot of information. <br><br>Most commercial satellites are unencrypted, but they have a very picky piece of equipment called a transceiver that listens to rf energy on a specific frequency that comes in. This rf energy has data on it, which has to have a very specific set of information in its header (read up on ccsds if you<sq>re super curious). Then, it has to have a very specific set of bits for the command. If it<sq>s not perfect throughout all of this (frequency, ccsds header, command bits) the transceiver will ignore the command. It will also alert the actual ground crew that it rejected a command. <br><br>Some satellites have encryption on it, which means you not only have to get all this other stuff right, but you also have to encrypt your signal with the right coding. On top of this, others have frequency hopping, meaning that you have to send certain parts of each command on specific frequencies. <br><br>As for the DSN being the only piece of equipment capable of talking to New Horizons, yes that is true.

According to FAR 25 rules an aircraft taxing must be able to lean at least 5 degrees towards either wing without striking anything against the ground. Smaller aircraft have shorter wings, therefore they can sit closer to the ground, until eventually anything hanging below the wing fails the 5 degree criterion. Aircraft have as short of landing gear as they possibly can for structural, weight, and practical reasons - so the engine are relocated to the aft fuselage section.<br><br>This 5 degree requirement is why the newer 737s have flat bottomed engine nacelles.  As the plane was originally designed with low bypass turbofans,  and then with the NG models was given high bypass turbofans that failed the 5 degree rule, so they got creative with design.<br><br>Edit - theres a second part to your question that I missed before. On large aircraft the engines are placed on the wings for a few reasons, the main two  being noise comfort and structural considerations. Noise is obvious, put the engines as far from people as possible. Structural is clever though. <br>The engines act as big weights to reduce the flex of the wings in flight, also they act as dampers for the wings because of their mass. By placing the engines on the wings of large aircraft you can actually reduce the amount of structural material in your wing, making it lighter. So small aircraft the wings are only 20 or 30 ft long, and are so short that flexing isn<sq>t a real concern in flight, so the engines can be easily moved aft and out of the way.</p>",

Excuse me for using terminology that you already know, this answer is more everyone here that may be curious at this point. <br><br>The simple answer to why this is not more common place is going to be cost and lack of knowledge on the part of the contractors doing the work. <br><br>However, if you want to get this done, there is a way that would likely not be too expensive to get going. <br><br>A typical AC system works like the following<colon><br><br>Compressor -> Condenser -> Thermal Expansion Valve(TEV or TXV) -> Evaporator -> return to Compressor<br><br>The compressor and condenser being housed within the outdoor unit, often called the <dq>Condensing unit<dq>. <br><br>The TXV in a residential installation is usually located next to the Evaporator, housed in the <dq>Air Handling Unit<dq><br><br>The refrigerant temperatures out of the compressor are in the range of 110-140\u00b0F and 300-500 psi if you are using an R410a system. I am going to make this assumption as it is pretty much the standard in residential systems these days. <br><br>What you should consider doing is adding a refrigerant/water heat exchanger(a brazed plate heat exchanger) between the compressor and the condenser, within the outdoor condensing unit. You want water lines being run between building supply and your current hot water heater. Install a pressure relief valve in this line as well, after this heat exchanger and before the water heater. This pressure relief valve will be in addition to the one that already sits after the water heat discharge. <br><br>Your brazed plate heat exchanger will sit idle most of the time, that is, it is idle whenever water is NOT flowing into the hot water heater. This will cause the water that is sitting still to heat and increase pressure, hence the relief valve. This BHE is probably going to cost $100-200 to a contractor, with installed ranging from $300-1500 depending on water line complexity. You would need an HVAC tech to do the install. <br><br>But, whenever your AC unit is on and there is a call for MORE hot water in the hot water heater, you can get water flowing into the HWH that is warmer than building supply and cooler than required hot water temperature. <br><br>No, I don<sq>t want to do the sizing of the brazed plate heat exchanger for you. That part will cost an engineer working on a custom system probably another few hundred dollars, at least. <br><br>Bottom line is you will spend maybe $2000 or more on this, on the low side, only to save a little bit of money on your water heating bill. <br><br>EDIT<colon>misremembered R410a temps.

This is able to work because the refrigerant is cooler than the inside air when in the evaporator coil and warmer than the outside air when in the condenser coil. As the difference diminishes between the ambient air temperature and the temperature of the refrigerant, the efficiency of the system suffers. This is a primary reason why people with cold winters use gas heat instead of heat pumps.<br><br>Imagine how hot the refrigerant would need to be to be able to release heat into a hot water heater that is normally operating in the 110-140F range. As /r/Hewhoisnottobenamed mentioned, systems like this do exist, but they are generally not economical and probably cost more money and energy in a typical heat pump system.<br><br>One possible exception would be on a ground-loop heat pump (also improperly known as *geothermal* heat pumps). With the constant ground temperature year-round, you can more efficiently install a secondary heat exchanger for water. From my limited research last time I was looking into a ground loop system, I believe these take up a decent amount of space--and of course they only run when your heat pump is running.</p>",

And of course exploring them is great and exactly what someone in your shoes should do!<br><br>But please consider doing it the way your professors have suggested.  Another first in your life<colon>  you are exploring topics that are not well understood.  No one has done a good job outlining where models work well and where they break down.  No one is going to hand you a list of pre-requisites to understanding an answer they<sq>re about to give you (which is necessary for all the questions you<sq>ve asked).  No one has neatly outlined all technical terms in a dictionary that we have all agreed to use.  You<sq>re entering the world of engineering, where we take straight-forward theories and try to build something out of them.  If you<sq>re building something that doesn<sq>t require putzing around with those theories the professors are teaching you, you<sq>re not doing much of value.<br><br>Not only that, but the theories start building on each other.  Ohm<sq>s Law might be really simple.  Everyone aces the chapter that introduces it.  Lot<sq>s of basic algebra.  Then it gets complicated.  It<sq>s long division all over again, the same principles you<sq>ve been using apply, but they can get really tricky!  You might be keeping up, but lots of others are struggling.  If you can show that you<sq>ve mastered the basics, I<sq>d assume most professors are going to notice the aptitude.  But if you<sq>re like most college students (as I was), then you<sq>re excited about the next idea, not about doing hard work to master the fundamentals.<br><br>And out here in the real world?  Being able to apply Ohm<sq>s Law in the most awkward of places is infinitely more useful and meaningful (ie, people will pay you very good money to do it) than understanding how to get a flip-flop to respond on both clock edges (someone did once and now we have the luxury of not caring!).<br><br>The fundamentals matter on a regular basis and set apart the great engineers.  Your professors aren<sq>t just annoyed by you asking questions above your understanding, they<sq>re also annoyed that they<sq>re seeing someone chasing ideas rather than trying hard at college.

Basically, you have to understand causality, laplace/fourier transforms, convolution, and a few other nifty tricks.. Signals start at time = 0 and are the result of a circuit system and an input. Each circuit has a characteristic transfer function that acts completely independent of the input. You can google the classic transfer functions for low pass, high pass, RLC, whatever circuits. feedback circuits also work the same way but it starts getting tricky with stability, damping, etc.<br><br>Ok, now you have an input signal.

After 40 years or so, you know a little more, and still have a huge number of questions.   Some are more complicated than the ones from way back then, but the feeling is exactly the same.<br><br>Saturation of wide topics, with abundant reading, lab time, more reading, working along side a tutor/mentor... then one day...

You have a revelation and it all fits together.<br><br>Big pieces are still missing, and in critical areas you are still operating on a bad conclusion, wrong data, incorrect understanding, and while you are working hard and screwing things up, you are forgetting all that crap you learned about materials and statistics, not to mention history, literature, and humanities.<br><br>Life is really short compared to how much there is to learn!  Particularly true of a field where you can<sq>t see a lot of the things you are working on.<br><br>I<sq>ll try a few.....<br><br>1)  <sq>voltage drop over gates<sq> doesn<sq>t apply in digital circuits as much as time delays apply.  Each time you go through a gate, the output is still a logical value... the circuit is designed to provide a valid level and you don<sq>t lose any voltage from gate to gate. You DO encounter a time penalty, depending on the nature of the gate and the technology involved.  (e.g., 74LS14 gates are a lot slower to propagate than a 74LVC14.)<br><br>2) <dq>Signal<dq> is a big word.  One bit moving from gate to gate is a signal, and so is high power radio frequency AC, or audio oscillation, or the DC voltage coming from a thermocouple.  It sounds like you are talking about oscillators.   Look at some really simple ones... like a relaxation oscillator.  Once you grok that and can see how the basic elements work, look at a more complicated one.  A simple one is an inverter with a feedback resistor and series cap.  A Schmidt trigger inverter or an op amp are good simple choices.  See how that works.  Just read about it on the internet until you are sick of it and you will eventually get it.  Once you are sick of it, wait a few days and read the stuff again.  Your brain will be working on it while you take a break.  Trust me.   You have a lot of time.    <br><br>3) In the old days, dopants were added to semiconductor substrates in a process similar to making a newspaper... called photolithography.     The (usually) silicon was oxidized at high temperature and made what was called an epitaxial layer (very thin) of glass.  This was photosensitized with a chemical coating, the coating exposed to the desired pattern was hardened with UV light, and the soft material was etched away chemically, leaving a pattern on top of the glass. Then, the glass layer was etched away.  The wafer was put into a hot oven and dopant gas introduced.  Time and temperature curves dictated the depth of dopant penetration.  The process was repeated for the next dopant, and eventually all of the doping <dq>stained<dq> the silicon to various depths and this is what made the circuit element.  It<sq>s like touching a piece of chalk with a Sharpie...  the dark ink infiltrates based on how long you hold it. Repeat with different colors.<br><br>4) You design a flip flop (or any other circuit) to do what you want it to do.  If you want something to react to only rising clocks, you design something that takes what ever you have and makes rising clocks only (or more of them) and you use these clocks to do what you need done.  <dq>How do you design X<dq> is a question everyone has at the beginning.    It starts with intent, and what you can do often is based on what you understand at that point.  There is no single solution to most problems.  There are elegant ones, efficient ones, quickly realized ones, minimal part count ones, high reliability ones...  you have to sort through your needs and constraints.  Question is too unclear for an exact answer, but the guts of your question are going to reappear somewhere besides flip flops.  Wait until you have a big project!  (This is why they make senior engineers...  we have fucked up so much by the time a decade or two passes that the odds are increasingly in favor of us doing something right.   In reality, what it means is that we have seen the right way, the wrong way, the management way, the marketing way and have learned to keep our mouth shut and go do what needs to be done.    That<sq>s why we<sq>re engineers.   Let the MBAs think we<sq>re non communicative if they want.

There is no such thing as simultaneous.  Sometimes, they work in your favor.  Realize, too, that your design might be clicking along processing inputs at a few kilohertz, but the gates themselves can move the signals around in sub-nanosecond delays and they can stabilize long before your dottering little clock edge comes along to latch them or something.  Design SOMETIMES fails due to delays,  and it<sq>s up to you to account for them.  They are usually orders of magnitude shorter than the clocks, but not always.      (I used to have a little board that had a D-type flip flop with data and clock inputs separated by a few hertz.  Eventually, the clock and data lines on the D-type flip flop they ran would get a setup-and-hold timing violation and the flip flop would go meta-stable...(Q and NOT Q) were both true at the same time for a nanosecond and a half.   That would make your nuclear reactor have a fit!  It was used to demonstrate the ability of a logic analyzer to catch this type of event.  very cool. )<br><br>Remember...  you have to deal with both real world and ideal stuff in your studies.

That tube runs back up into the fuel pump handle and as gas flows through the nozzle, the vacuum pressure created by the venturi causes air to be sucked up through the tube. As long as the tank is not completely full, air flows unimpeded up into the handle, and nothing much happens except that fuel continues to pour into your car.<br><br>>As your gas tank fills, the fuel level rises until it covers the hole at the end of the nozzle. Suddenly, the flow of air stops and the vacuum pressure begins to build \u2014 think of what happens when you suck on a straw without putting it in water; if you place your finger over the open end, the flow of air stops and the pressure inside decreases until the straw collapses. In the nozzle handle, the vacuum pressure builds until it forces a small diaphragm inside the handle to move. That movement triggers a lever that pops the handle trigger, shutting off the flow of gasoline.<br><br>>Pretty clever, eh? And it\u2019s all done without transistors or sensors.

But it has back up systems after backup systems. If hydraulic pressure fails and they lose control it can be switched over to manual control.. I am pretty sure there is even a backup switch to that where if one manual control fails there is a second manual control.<br><br>In addition, the wheels are designed for crash landings. If you notice, the back two wheels never fully go into the fuselage. This is so that if there needs to be a crash landing, or the gear extending doesn<sq>t work anymore, the partially exposed wheels can still help some when landing on the belly. On top of that, all the wheels are designed to open against the direction of travel (so the wheels go up swinging towards the nose, then when they go down they swing away from the nose). This is also in case the gear control gets shot out the pilot can override it and just drop the gear manually and have gravity and the wind lock the gear into place.<br><br>There was also a TIL a little back that told how the A-10 was designed to be able to fly with half a wing, half a tail, and only 1 engine all at the same time.<br><br>Fuel system has backup after backup as well. Self sealing fuel tanks. And even if all those backup fail, just the fuel that is stored in the lines can get the A-10 another 100 miles or something like that. So even with no fuel pump, and all the fuel out of the tank, it still can fly for awhile.<br><br>Pretty cool plane, that is for sure.</p>",

As wind blows the 40degF (4degC) air around the tub of water, it will cool down in a shorter amount of time. The harder or faster the wind speed, the faster it will cool down to 40degF (4degC).

Air quality systems usually go on the ass end of a power plant in the form of injecting limestone, ammonia, activated carbon, etc. then you have baghouses to catch the ash which increases the dp toward the end of the plant. Since most plants run on a negative furniture pressure  adequate suction is required to make sure the air can get sucked through all these systems added. This means they need to crank up the induced draft fan or add booster fans which cost more electricity (money). Then you have older plants that need more maintenance. With wind and solar cycling their load on the grid, traditional plants are forced to change their load more to compensate. This causes more thermal stresses which causes boiler tubes and ductwork to fatigue faster which adds to maintenance costs. Chemical usage to make sure the water you boil is acceptable is also increased.<br><br>Add all that in along with a traditionally older workforce who are near the tops of their pay scales and additional other regulations then youll see why the cost isn<sq>t going down.<br><br> Companies that supply the new renewable generAtion like wind turbines and solar are after all a company. To recoup their investment as soon as possible they want you the ratepayer to not pay less on your bill.

What a control *does* is a product of a LOT of interaction with the people that care about what a control does. For an appliance, that means very many people. I take a long time to understand what the control needs to deliver then spend a small fraction of that time essentially writing it down. There<sq>s nuance to the writing, but the part I enjoy is the interaction with engineers from many different backgrounds.<br><br>* What school did you attend, and why should I go there?<br><br>Wentworth Institute of Technology. They<sq>ve got an outstanding BELM program. It<sq>s a 5 year program, and it<sq>s expensive, but for a program with dual BS accreditation it<sq>s a good value. They invest heavily in their faculty and the return for the student is small classes and close, frequent interaction a very smart professor. The hard part is name recognition, so you<sq>d better reach out and start networking early because you won<sq>t get heard by a large corporation unless you meet their recruiters and/or employees. Also, division 3 baseball is their best sport, but the city of Boston and a short walk to Fenway park helps ease those needs.<br><br>* What\u2019s your favorite project you worked on in college or during your career?<br><br>My current role is my favorite. I can<sq>t speak about it, unfortunately.<br><br>* If you could do it all over again, would you do anything differently?<br><br>I don<sq>t like <dq>what-if<dq>s. Of course I could dig for whatever insecurity of the moment brings on a doubt about my current path but I don<sq>t find that<sq>s particularly productive. I focus my reflection on microeconomic moments like whether my approach to a problem was warranted or could have been approached in a different way to achieve the desired outcome.<br><br>Of course, I look at student debt and wish I<sq>d pursued a career in my metal band, but looking at the market for metal these days makes me think I still may have made the right choice.<br><br>* Do you have any advice for someone who<sq>s just getting started in engineering school/work?<br><br>Work smarter, *then* work harder. Make sure you give 20<percent> of your time to understanding the way you work. If you don<sq>t know how much time you spend working on how you work, start logging your time acutely. You<sq>ll learn yourself what I mean.</p>",

One of my earliest <dq>engineering moments<dq> was as a young boy in the Christmas of 1978 when I took apart my new Star Wars X-Wing fighter to figure out how the laser inside worked. It was one of many steps that eventually led me to where I am now.<br><br>* Why did you choose your field and/or specialization?<br><br>Honestly? I<sq>d say computer games were to blame (inspiration) for me to go down the path that led me to Systems Engineering. I had just finished my first year in college as a BioEngineering - Genetics focus student, and I was miserable. I sat back that summer and did a lot of thinking while working 2 manual labor jobs (lots of time to think) about what I wanted to be when I grew up. I loved playing computer games on my uber 386DX 33mhz computer (complete with a VGA monitor AND a sound card that did speech!), and I enjoyed helping out the computer lab I had a work study position with doing batch files to help enable students run WordPerfect and Quattro Pro. So I decided to change majors to CSE and see if that was what made my heart sing. In the end it goes back to my childhood obsession that led me to SE/SEA. I didn<sq>t want to just write a line of code that turned a 1 into a 0, I wanted to understand the primitives (who, what, when, where, and why) behind the decision that resulted in me writing that code. <br><br>* What type of experience did you gain before becoming systems engineer? Did you know you wanted to become a systems engineer beforehand, or was it a coincidence?<br><br>I began my career as a software developer. I graduated college while Y2K was a BIG deal and I reverse engineered and rewrote thousands upon thousands of lines of COBOL to turn 2 digit dates into 4 digit dates. Not exactly an electrifying endeavor, but all the grey-beards who wrote the source back in the 70<sq>s & 80<sq>s were either dead or retired. I spent a few years in the Dot-bomb industry doing JAVA and JSP development for a commercial startup until the bubble burst in the early 2000<sq>s. Shortly thereafter I ended up with the company I am still at today.<br><br>I didn<sq>t know I needed (yes, needed) to be a Systems Engineer. I knew I had a very driven curiosity to understand more about what I was doing and why I was doing it. When I was in college my favorite courses all revolved around systems analysis and systems design. When the opportunity came to become a SE I almost jumped at it, literally. When I learned about the Architecture side of SE is when the epiphany hit me, this is what I wanted to be when I grew up!<br><br>* What\u2019s a normal day like at work for you? Can you describe your daily tasks?<br><br>I am not sure there is a normal day at work for me. I am the Systems Engineering Architecture lead on a multi-billion dollar program. I am responsible for making sure that the system of systems my program is building closes (meets all contractual obligations and requirements) and is complete (the delivered systems perform their mission function(s) in tandem with the users to achieve the desired and intended results).<br><br>On any given day I have between 1 and 20 meetings, 90<percent> of which are technical in nature. I am generally brought into a meeting to make a decision. That decision is usually to resolve a technical disagreement, or to provide direction on a technical issue. On a day to day (sometimes hour to hour) basis what I do depends on what is needed. In the morning I could be in the DoDAF system architecture model making updates to a sub-element state machine, in the afternoon I could be in the software UML model tracing and analyzing interface data exchanges across components. Tomorrow I could spend the whole day writing or reviewing requirements (and boy do I ever look at a lot of requirements) or updating CDRLs and contractual deliverables. That is in addition to the meetings described above. I have threatened on more than one occasion to get one of those Deli <dq>take a number<dq> dispensers and hang a <dq>Now Serving<dq> sign outside my office.  <br><br>* What school did you attend, and why should I go there?<br><br>University of Pennsylvania. You should not go there, at least not because I said you should. As an aspiring engineer you should take your college selection as your first analysis project. Perform a trade study, weigh the criteria, perform the analysis of your options against the criteria, and study the results. That would be of a lot more value than any opinion I could give you without knowing you or your unique circumstance.<br><br>* What\u2019s your favorite project you worked on in college or during your career?<br><br>Freshman college course project in BioEngineering to define a <dq>product<dq> that would be on the cutting edge of technology in 20 years. The four person team I was on designed the AGMIR 2010, or Automatic Glucose Monitor & Insulin Regulator. The AGMIR 2010 was a self-sustaining bio-medical implant that, in essence, cured Type 1 Diabetes. 2010 was the year we were projecting the product to be available. We were wrong, but we sure did have a lot of fun.  <br><br>* If you could do it all over again, would you do anything differently?<br><br>Yes. I would have started in CSE right from the start and I would not have waited as long as I did to get out of software development and into Systems Engineering. <br><br>* Do you have any advice for someone who<sq>s just getting started in engineering school/work?<br><br>1) This may sound crass... There is only one person on this planet that has a 100<percent> vested interest in your success, and that is you. To everybody else you are either a number, a job, a commodity, or a resource. Invest in yourself, advocate for yourself.<br><br>2) Getting an education has a whole lot more to do with what you did to achieve it than it does where you did it. <br><br>3) Find one or more mentors. Ask questions and suck their brains dry of knowledge. But always remember mentoring is a two way street, if you are not giving then soon enough you will not be receiving either.<br><br>Finally...<br><br>4) This is less of an issue with engineers than with the general public, but here it is<colon> The world owes you nothing, your parents owe you nothing, your job owes you nothing. You should be looking every day for opportunities to earn your career, your family, your place in society. There is a lot of self-entitlement running around out in the real world, and it is not just manifested in the millennials</p>",

I did a summer internship at NASA where I learned about PID control and was immediately amazed by the concept and decided to specialize in Controls. The more I learned, the more I love it. The idea that the things can be converted into mathematical equations and then studied, predicted, and changed has always intrigued me.<br><br>* What type of experience did you gain before becoming systems engineer? Did you know you wanted to become a systems engineer beforehand, or was it a coincidence?<br>My current title is <dq>chief engineer<dq> and I<sq>ve always had a knack for looking at a project and breaking it down into pieces. I don<sq>t consider myself a systems engineer, as that has a very particular meaning and connotation at NASA. But I feel that much of the work the old-school systems engineers do is very similar to what I do currently in that we segment problems or systems into constituent parts or subsystems and then study the interactions and data-flow. I found myself stumbling into the position during my last few years at NASA and was then hired by a start-up to do it full-time.<br><br>* What\u2019s a normal day like at work for you? Can you describe your daily tasks?<br>My job is split between managing a team of engineers, doing system-level architecture and design, and researching new architectures and approaches to interesting problems. The architecture and design pretty directly maps to my teams and a key challenge that I have to address is to keep the teams in communication so they don<sq>t lose track of the big picture and how their specific part plays with the rest of the system. I usually spend a couple of hours each day writing functional specs, brainstorming user interfaces, designing APIs, and other similar stuff. There<sq>s always meetings that have to be held to keep the engineering org in sync with sales and marketing and at least an hour or two on the phone with customers or partners. I then also do all the extra stuff that people at start-ups do<colon> packing product, FedEx drops, working with the over-seas production facility, etc. Every day is usually different than the previous!<br><br>* What school did you attend, and why should I go there?<br>I went to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. It is a great school (currently doing my PhD there) that a focus on theoretical over practical (which is good and bad). As with all universities, you get out what you put in.<br><br>* What\u2019s your favorite project you worked on in college or during your career?<br>I really have enjoyed every project I<sq>ve been on and have learned an incredible amount from each. I<sq>ve done lots of things that typical <dq>desk jockey<dq> engineers never get to do. Every project gets old or boring every once in a while, the challenge is to learn as much as you can and keep asking questions to prevent things from getting stuck in a rut.<br><br>* If you could do it all over again, would you do anything differently?<br>Not at all.<br><br>* Do you have any advice for someone who<sq>s just getting started in engineering school/work?<br>In school take up lots of outside activities; just make sure to always put school first. You really grow and learn those years and have the freedom to fail without serious risk. Learn from those failures as that is what makes a good engineer a great engineer. Make sure to do internships or co-ops so you can get experience and feel free to try different jobs!<br><br>Let me know if you have any questions!</p>",

During the course of the day, I interact with multiple product teams from Avionics, FR, EMI/EMC, Structures, Launch Ops and Mission Management. I review Engineering Evidence to ensure that it meets the standard and intent of the requirement I am closing out. I contact customers for information to ensure that their verifications meet the same standards and that their payload will not fail on the ride up to orbit. I coordinate technical changes between the customers and the tech teams, and work with mission management to drive/reject changes as needed. (Lots of meetings, but lots of interesting conversations)<br><br>* What school did you attend, and why should I go there?<br><br>Metropolitan State University of Denver. Non-traditional University. Good for Vets and people with families, but you WILL need to find out where the degree has its shortcomings, and make up for it (Hint<colon> Take Calc3, DiffEq, and Linear Algebra/Matrices. And programming/MatLab.

I think that its capabilities as an airplane - speed, range, maneuverability - were a relatively small differentiator.<br><br>But I can talk with more authority about aerodynamics and propulsion than I can about weapons and sensors, so, to answer your question...<br><br>What makes one design more maneuverable than the other? Well, <dq>maneuverable<dq> means a lot of things. Three key ones are roll rate, thrust-to-weight ratio, and the ability to pull Gs (ideally without losing too much speed).<br><br>Roll rate is pretty much determined by the size of the ailerons (which determines the max roll rate), by how far they are from the centerline, and by how well-balanced they are and what kind of hydraulic assist there is (i.e. by how hard the pilot has to work to get that max roll rate). In our case here, the <dq>ailerons<dq> are unusual<colon> Unlike the vast majority of airplanes, both the F-14 and the MiG-23 do not have ailerons on the wings, they only have elevons, i.e. they roll by rotating one horizontal tail fin upwards and one downwards. I don<sq>t know how the MiG-23 and the F-14 compare in the area of their horizontal tail fins, but you can estimate them from looking at top-view drawings if you want. Of course, you don<sq>t just need the area of the horizontal tail fins (which can tell you how much force they can exert at high speed, assuming a lift coefficient per area that is comparable to wings of the same shape, such as, say, Concorde wings) and their distance from the centerline (which combines with that force, to give you the moment), you<sq>d also need to compare the moment of inertia of the F-14 with that of the MiG. How do the moments of inertia compare? Well, the F-14 has a wingspan of 60 feet, the MiG<sq>s is 46 feet. The F-14<sq>s loaded weight is 61000 lbs, the MiG<sq>s is 35000 lbs. (BTW, MTOWs are ~75 and ~40-44). So assuming a similar distribution of mass (which is probably not a great assumption because the MiG<sq>s engine is right on the centerline, but oh well), the F-14<sq>s moment of inertia is about 3 times the MiG<sq>s (which I got by doing 61000/35000 times the square of 60/46). So in order to be as maneuverable as the MiG, the F-14 needs tail finsthat are X times bigger and Y times further from the centerline, where X times Y has to be 3 or more. (This assumes they are similarly balanced and that the pilot has a similar level of <dq>power steering<dq> assistance from the hydraulic system). Again, you can go measure up the drawings to compare the tail fin sizes and their distances from the centerline, and see what you come up with.<br><br>Thrust-to-weight ratio is easy. Using loaded weights and afterburners, for the F-14 it<sq>s 55600/61000=0.9. For the MiG, it<sq>s 28700/35000=0.8. This, of course, depends on how much fuel and weapons are on board, and whether they have earlier engines or later engines. But it means that, in general, the F-14 probably climbs better, and probably loses less speed during tight turns, than the MiG does. Both of these things are determined not really by the thrust-to-weight ratio but by the <dq>excess thrust<dq>, i.e. by the thrust needed to fly in a straight line at the speed the airplane is going, subtracted from how much thrust is available, giving you the <dq>extra<dq> thrust that can be used for climbing, accelerating, or keeping the speed up while pulling Gs. So what may seem like a small difference (.9 versus .8) can actually become a huge difference in <dq>excess thrust<dq>. For example, if these airplanes need ~60<percent> of its weight in thrust in order to fly at some speed (e.g. just below the speed of sound), then the F-14 has 30<percent> of its weight in <dq>extra<dq> thrust, while the MiG only has 20<percent>. So the F-14 basically has 50<percent> more available extra thrust (proportionally to its weight) to <dq>play with<dq> than the MiG does, once they<sq>re flying at a few hundred mph.<br><br>As for the ability to pull Gs, that gets really complicated. It depends primarily on the angle of attack at which the airplane stalls. This, in turn, depends on things like the airfoil cross-sections, their sweep and taper (which, in this case, are variable), the impact of vortices from LERXs and other little fins and things, and of course primarily on the wing loading (which is usually just <dq>weight divided by wing area<dq>... but when it comes to fighters, how much of the flat-ish fuselage counts as <dq>wing area<dq>?). In a dogfight, this can become the dominant parameter, and unfortunately, I don<sq>t know enough details to give you an answer. Some quick Googling shows that most MiGs stall around 150 mph and most US Navy fighters stall at around 130, although of course these are for the <dq>wings unswept<dq> configuration, and probably using things like flaps and maybe slats. Who knows how much higher those numbers get when the wings are swept back? Anyways... In theory, if an airplane at a certain weight stalls at a certain speed, then if it is going at X times that speed, it can pull X\u00b2 Gs. So if an F-14 is configured so that it stalls at 130 mph, then while flying at 390 mph it should be able to pull 9Gs, in theory. But in practice, this may not be true<colon> Not only are the aforementioned flaps and slats retracted, but also the structure might not be able to take 9Gs (especially with the wings unswept, where the root bending moment will be higher), or the force required on the stick might be higher than what the pilot can produce, or the elevons might not deflect enough to pitch the nose up that much, or the higher speed may cause the stall to happen at a lower angle of attack (thus <dq>breaking<dq> the X\u00b2 relationship), or the drag might get so high that the speed drops too quickly for such a maneuver to be sustained for more than a couple seconds. That<sq>s where you get into the nitty-gritty of flying a specific airplane<colon> How quickly does the energy bleed off as a function of altitude and of Gs? What is the <dq>rule of thumb<dq> for how many Gs you can pull (as a function of altitude) without bleeding off speed too quickly, assuming you give it full afterburner? The faster you fly, the more Gs you can pull, but the slower you fly, the more degrees-per-second you can turn while pulling a certain number of Gs, so... at what speed can you swing the nose around the fastest, at the most degrees per second? That depends on how the airplane stalls, as a function of altitude... So many factors impact each other in funny non-linear ways, that each airplane basically becomes a list of <dq>sweet spots<dq> and <dq>rules of thumb<dq>, and I<sq>m not going to be able to guess them just by looking at the numbers available online. It would make a fun school project or something, though.<br><br>Does that answer your question... as much as it can reasonably be answered without breaking out the CFD? ;]<br><br>Edit<colon> Added flaps and slats into the part about stall speeds, to help show why the 130 and 150 numbers are not a good predictor for how many Gs the airplanes can pull while flying faster.</p>",

So you see, they<sq>re not the same.<br><br>First, the acceleration. When you<sq>re looking at a plane, there are four major forces acting on the plane that can produce acceleration in flight. First is the thrust of the engines, second is the lift from the wings, third is the drag of the wind on the craft, and fourth is its weight from flying in a gravity well. The pilot has immediate control over two of them, the thrust and the lift, so in discussions of maneuverability, those are the big two.<br><br>Thrust is pretty simple. For big thrust, you have a big engine, but that comes at the price of added mass, which significantly offsets the benefit of the extra thrust. You<sq>ll also run into increased fuel usage, which means you either sacrifice range or add more fuel and sacrifice maneuverability.<br><br>Lift is a little bit more subtle. A lot of people don<sq>t think about it, but the biggest force most airplanes produce isn<sq>t from the engines. It<sq>s from the wings, and that makes sense if you think about it a bit. Most airplanes *can<sq>t* take off straight-up, but take off they do, so yeah, it<sq>s the wings that do most of the work. Once again, it<sq>s the mass of the plane that is what tries to hold you back, so the important measurement here is <dq>Wing loading<dq>, which is the ratio of the mass to the wing surface area. The higher your wing loading is, the more lift per area your wings need to generate to fly. Now, it<sq>s not an *exact* measurement of the acceleration potential, because it doesn<sq>t tell you how much your wings *can* produce, just how much they have to. It<sq>s still useful, however, because a craft with high wing loading will need to produce a lot of lift just to be able to fly at all, so there isn<sq>t much <dq>extra<dq> lift available to help maneuver. Another measurement of the lifting ability of the wings is climb rate.<br><br>So those are the big forces the pilot can call on to move their plane around. That leads to the next problem, though<colon> The thrust points forward, and the lift points up, and if your pilot wants to change the direction those forces point, she has to move *the whole aircraft* to do it.<br><br>This gets... a little bit fuzzy at this point. It<sq>s easy to put a number on the thrust an engine produces, but the rate an aircraft can turn will vary significantly under different circumstances. One of the big issues for airplanes is that the amount of lift the wings can produce strongly depends upon the direction the airflow hits them from, the <dq>angle of attack<dq> being the vertical part of that direction and the <dq>side slip<dq> being the horizontal part. When you increase the angle of attack, lift will increase dramatically until the angle gets too large and the airflow separates from the wings and lift plummets. There<sq>s a *similar* issue with side slip, but it<sq>s a bit hairier to explain so I<sq>d rather just say <dq>high sideslip is bad, and it<sq>s worse for airplanes with swept wings.<dq><br><br>There is one really good measurement that will give you an idea of the aircraft<sq>s turning rate, and that<sq>s the difference between the <dq>center of gravity<dq> and the <dq>aerodynamic center<dq>/<dq>center of lift<dq>/<dq>center of drag<dq>/et cetera, which is the point that aerodynamic forces <dq>can be considered to act through<dq> (They don<sq>t really, but gravity doesn<sq>t really act through the center of gravity, either, so there you go.) If the CoG is much farther forward than the AC, the aerodynamic forces will force the craft to point in the direction of travel and keep it from turning very far to the side. If it<sq>s far behind, those forces will try to flip the plane around, and if they<sq>re right on top of each other, the plane will pretty much point wherever. For maneuverability, you want the CoG as far back as you can safely get it before it makes the plane uncontrollable. You<sq>ll also want large, strong control surfaces far away from the center of gravity so they can apply large moments.<br><br>Enough theory, what<sq>s up with these two planes? According to the (rather limited) numbers I can find, the MiG is comparable or slightly better than the F-14 in every way that relates to maneuverability. Slightly lower thrust/weight, significantly lower wing loading, higher (or comparable, depending on *just how much* greater the US means when it says <dq>greater than 45,000 ft/minute<dq>) climb rate... What I could not find was good numbers on the turn rate, and since both planes are swing-wings, they<sq>ll both have highly variable CoG and AC positions, so it<sq>s hard to draw a distinction there. <br><br>*If* the F-14 had a much higher success rate because of its maneuverability, it must have had a significantly higher turn rate than the MiG 23. At this point, it<sq>s just speculation on my part, though. *Possible* reasons could be that the F-14<sq>s wing joint could move faster to allow faster transition, or it had more effective control surfaces, or more favorable distribution of mass, or its airfoils could better tolerate high angles of attack, or, or, or... <br><br>*With all that said, it seems likely that the difference in success rates was not entirely up to the design of the airframe, but rather, as others have suggested, differences in targeting/weapons capabilities, or pilot training, or just the level of support they had in operation.*</p>",

This plate has friction pads, which come into contact with another plate that is connected to the gearbox, from which the connection to the wheels starts. This connection transfers the rotation of the engine shaft to rotation of the shaft at the gearbox. When you push down on the clutch, you disconnect these two plates, so that both sides can rotate independently of eachother.<br><br>> Why does the car stall when it<sq>s stationary and I release the clutch and the gas?       <br>            <br>The plate on the side of your engine is rotating and the plate at the gearbox is not.

When you depress the clutch, the plate at the gearbox side (which rotates the wheel) starts to slow down because there is no more input from the engine.

The engine suddenly experiences extra load because the gearbox and wheels are again engaged onto the engine, so the car will slighty slow down, making your car dip a bit. This is why you need to apply enough gas to handle that extra load to the engine, but not too much so the speed difference between the friction plates isn<sq>t becoming too large.   <br>> How does the handbrake work as a mechanism?

On the wheel, you can imagine it as a drum that runs with the wheel. Inside of this drum are two friction pads. If you press the brake, the friction pads are pushed onto the inner surface of the drum with pressure from the brake lines. I know that in older cars, the handbrake is a cable that connects to these friction pads, pushing them against the drum.

I don<sq>t drive stick, but I<sq>ll do my best to explain the mechanism.<br><br>So, what the clutch does is it disconnects the engine from the gearbox and wheels by means of [a fairly complicated mechanism](https<colon>//www.howacarworks.com/basics/how-a-car-clutch-works). The gas pedal controls the amount of fuel and air going into the engine, which controls the power. When you have the gas released, the engine will normally be at idle, meaning there<sq>s just enough fuel going in to keep it spinning against friction and any power demands for peripheral hardware like the air conditioner and electrical system. It<sq>s also at low speed, so there<sq>s not much kinetic energy in the flywheel and crankshaft.<br><br>When you release the clutch without adding power, the engine suddenly engages the wheels, but it<sq>s not producing enough torque to significantly accelerate the car, and the energy transferred from the flywheel isn<sq>t enough either, so the engine rapidly slows down and stops. This is a stall.<br><br>To start moving, you therefore need to simultaneously release the clutch while increasing power with the gas pedal. If you let off the clutch too early, you<sq>ll stall for the reason mentioned. If you apply the gas early, the engine will rev up to higher rpm, then suddenly engage the drivetrain. The large amount of energy in the flywheel will cause the car to <dq>lurch<dq> or jerk forward. This also forces the pressure plate and flywheel to slip against each other with more force than normal, which can cause the clutch to wear out faster.<br><br>> What exactly is the biting point? Why does it make the revs decrease and the front of the car <dq>fall<dq> slightly?<br><br>Basically, when the clutch pedal is fully depressed, the flywheel and pressure plate within the clutch are separated by a small distance. As you release the clutch pedal, there<sq>s a point somewhere in the middle where the discs just barely touch each other and the engine starts transmitting torque. This is called the <dq>biting point.<dq> Releasing the clutch further reduces the force counteracting the internal springs that ordinarily hold the plates together, so the contact force between them becomes greater and more torque can be transmitted.<br><br>> How does the handbrake work as a mechanism? What kind of mechanical action does it take in order to prevent the car from moving?<br><br>Basically, the handbrake lever, which has a ratchet mechanism to lock it in the extended position when you aren<sq>t touching it, pulls on a cable. This cable is split into two more cables by a <dq>Y<dq> shaped linkage called an equalizer that distributes the tension to both of the rear wheels. The tension in the cables forces brake shoes against brake pads; these can be the main brake, or sometimes a separate smaller brake. Note that on most cars the main brakes are hydraulically operated, but the cable on the handbrake is completely independent of this, and even if a ruptured brake line causes all the hydraulic fluid to leak out of the main brakes, the handbrake will still work. This is why it<sq>s often called an emergency brake.<br><br>> Why does the car crawl along on it<sq>s own when it<sq>s in gear and has gained enough speed?<br><br>Simple<colon> the engine is running, which means the crankshaft is spinning, and since it<sq>s in gear the crankshaft is connected to the wheels. Either the wheels turn or the engine stalls.<br><br>> What exactly is a stall?<br><br>The internal combustion engine in your car works on a self-sustaining cycle. Air and fuel are drawn into the cylinder by the piston moving upward, which requires energy. Then the intake valve closes and the piston is forced downward, compressing the mixture, which requires quite a bit of energy, just like it takes energy to force air into a tire using a bike pump. Then the mixture burns, forcing the piston upward and releasing a LOT of energy. Then the exhaust valve opens and the piston descends, pushing out the exhaust, with uses a little more energy. The energy required for all the steps that consume it comes from the kinetic energy of the spinning flywheel and crankshaft.<br><br>Now, basically what all this means is that both the torque and the power produced by an internal combustion engine get lower with decreasing speed, and eventually you<sq>ll reach a speed, where it just doesn<sq>t have enough energy to sustain the cycle, and will slow down further and stop. This is why with a pull-to-start engine on a lawnmower, chainsaw, or whatever, pulling slowly on the cord won<sq>t start the engine<colon> you need to get it going fast enough.<br><br> In practice, the engine<sq>s idle speed is usually quite a bit higher than the minimum speed because (a) vibrations are more severe at very low speeds, and (b) the engine needs to produce some power to drive things like fuel pumps, run the alternator to charge the battery, power air conditioning, etc.<br><br>But what happens if the engine is forcibly stopped completely - say, by suddenly adding a much bigger load like an entire car when you accidentally release the clutch? Now that the crankshaft isn<sq>t moving, there is *nothing* doing the work to compress the air-fuel mixture. The burning of fuel stops, the engine produces no power or torque whatsoever, and it will not produce power or torque until you start it again.<br><br>By contrast, a permanent magnet DC electric motor actually produces *maximum* torque for a given voltage when stationary, and maximum power at 50<percent> of its top speed.

                "answer": "<p>So to start you off right I<sq>d like to explain it from the beginning... the engine. A majority of vehicles today use an internal combustion engine (ICE). This engine has a series of cylinders which house an explosion from a fuel and air mixture. This fuel and air is ignited by your spark plugs. Each timed perfectly to spark each cylinder at an exact instant to allow for the fuel and air explosion. The explosion pushes the cylinder in a downward motion which causes a shaft to rotate. The more fuel and air you can push into the cylinder the larger the explosion, the faster the shaft rotates i.e. the faster your car moves. <br><br>The engine shaft (also known as the crank shaft) rotates. It<sq>s is always rotating when the engine is running. Always. The crank shaft is basically extended and attached to a circular plate (which we call a fly wheel), which is perpendicular to the center axis of the shaft. <br><br>What is also pretty interesting is that this fly wheel is also connected to your starter. The fly wheel has teeth, or gears on the end of it and mechanically connects to another gear. This other gear is connected to a shaft which is connected to the starter. The starter uses battery power to help turn the engine over through the flywheel, which is why you can<sq>t start your car while in gear. When your in a gear there is too much load, or friction for your tiny little starter turn the engine over. It would need to move the entire car to be able to turn over. When you see people roll a car down the hill, or a push a car to get it started they usually do this to create enough rotational speed from the tires, through your transmission and finally to the clutch/crank shaft. You<sq>ll hear the term pop the clutch, and this means that they engage the clutch and turn the ignition on. They do this if the starter is bad or the battery hasn<sq>t been charged. <br><br>So, anyways, back to the fly wheel. The fly wheel has a then ring attached to the face of the clutch. This ring is used to create friction between the fly wheel and the transmission. When you push the clutch in, it pulls the fly wheel away from the transmission. This is called the friction zone, or the bite as you have called it. The further you push in the clutch, the further the fly wheel gets from the transmission. <br><br>As the fly wheel makes a connection with the transmission it starts to transfer the power from the engine to the transmission. Within the transmission there are five or six differently sized gears. The larger the gear number, the larger it<sq>s outside diameter. At higher speeds, the higher gear numbers are used to convert the RPM<sq>s into torque. This is a whole other level of physics that might need another comment to discuss. So at the end of the transmission comes the drive shaft. This is a single shaft, connected to the rear axle. The rear axle contains a series of bevel gears which is more commonly known as the differential. Again, another whole comment is probably needed to describe this. The axle, as it takes power from the drive shaft spins the wheels. <br><br>The amount of power the wheels are  seeing is all dependent on how far you push in the clutch. You can rev the engine all the way up but barely engage the clutch and it won<sq>t go any faster. <br><br>So from the crank shaft, comes the fly wheel, which is semi-connected to the transmission (how much depends on the driver) where the tranny is connected to a drive shaft which turns the rear axles which then spin the tires. </p>",

In theory, the low bid process is supposed to ensure the best possible price. In practice, however, suppliers face a lot of risk and end up building that into their pricing.  <br>  <br>For example, the engineers might want XYZ and they might try really hard to get that written into the specs, but the specs will end up reading XYZ, ABC, or equal. Well sure enough, this set of engineers would try to add verbiage to favor XYZ since that<sq>s what they really want. But the old specs may have had verbiage that favored ABC. And rather than completely rewrite the specs, the engineers just keep parts of each. Well over the course of years or decades, the specs get so messed up that no product actually meets them 100<percent>. Come bid day, the big unknown is whether the reviewing engineer (different company than the specifying engineer) will accept the equipment you proposed.  <br>  <br>You bid a firm price that you<sq>ll supply something that meets the specifications and hope that 6-18 months later, the reviewing engineer agrees.

                "answer": "<p>I kind of took OP<sq>s question in a slightly different direction. Bear with me a moment.<br><br>Locomotive technology is kind of the opposite of how vehicle technology developed. We were actively using steam trains well into the latter half of the 20th century simply because of the raw force you can extract from pressurized steam. It was reliable and, more importantly, it was a very *simple* system all around. Make steam, push it into a piston one way, then the other way when the piston gets to the end. Scale this up and you have the [Big Boy](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific_Big_Boy).<br><br>Now the problem is, of course, you have this massive boiler and a ton of water you have to lug around. Plus the whole coal thing as well, which was just obnoxious. Eventually we developed fuel burning boilers, but you still had that whole boiler to deal with. An alternative was sought.<br><br>Electric drive locomotives were developed around a similar timeframe to the electric car, with Siemens (the man, not just the company) developing them around 1880 or so. The problem was the same as the electric car, namely, batteries suck and are heavy. So long as you could electrify the rails they would work (and went on to be a smashing success for subways). The US had a *lot* of rail to cover though, so it was a non-starter. Torque was great, the problem was <sq>fuel<sq>.<br><br>There were a number of direct-drive ICE to rail developments, but all stemmed from a similar problem<colon> power to weight ratios were poor, and raw torque was not sufficient for some of the long freight applications necessary in the US West mountains. Steam won the day for a long time. Torque was the problem, but fuel was plentiful.<br><br>GE was one of the developers of the electric locomotive, and had initial success. Upon running into the issue of rail electrification costs, they then asked what was stopping anyone from mounting a diesel generator *on the locomotive*. So they did that, developed a control system to control both the generator and electric motors in tandem, and then started building [44-tonners](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_44-ton_switcher).<br><br>This proved the concept. Use electric motors to actually move the vehicle, and then a diesel motor to generate the required electricity at the point of use. This was a *phenomenal* concept. The diesel generator can be tuned to work well at a handful of speed ranges, and you get to have the excellent low speed torque characteristics of the electric motors. Not to mention the decreased mechanical complexity (outside of the diesel engine you had a handful of moving parts<colon> the generator and an air compressor being the primary bits).<br><br>The concept was a hit for switchyards. Previously you<sq>d have to keep a small locomotive heated up during lots of breaks throughout the day as work came and went. A diesel-electric locomotive could be turned off and turned on within a few minute<sq>s time. Simple. As development of diesel engines continued their running costs verses steam dropped. Parts were easier to mass produce, locomotives didn<sq>t need to be custom built for individual routes, and operator count could be safely decreased to a single driver. The concept of consists came into play, where multiple diesel locomotives can be chained together and operate as one very big very powerful locomotive. This was nearly unheard of with steam power.<br><br>As a result, (nearly) every locomotive you see operating on modern railroads in the US will be a diesel-electric locomotive. Usually several decades old because they simply just keep plugging along fine.<br><br>---<br><br>As to OP<sq>s question. Given the preponderance of information about how much batteries suck, I took his question to be <dq>Why didn<sq>t the [diesel-electric powertrain](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel-electric_transmission) ever develop for cars?<dq> This type of powertrain bypasses the issue of storing electrical energy, and instead using a much more efficient storage medium<colon> diesel. The problem lies in the manufacturing complexity. Electric motors, especially larger ones that a car might need, were expensive at the time. Fine manufacturing tolerances for things like gearboxes and early drivetrains had been developed and were decreasing in cost. ICEs were readily developed for producing plenty of power in a fairly simple system, which could then be attached to a fairly simple and inexpensive set of gears in order to propel the vehicle forward. <br><br>Quite simply, there was no demand for it like with train designs. <br><br>As vehicle sizes increased, however, the concept was revisited. Most large mining equipment makes use of electric motors with onboard diesel generators, mostly because they have to. At that size most direct drive ICEs would simply stall out on the torque requirement. Electric motors work very differently at 0 RPM and can handle the demands placed on the vehicle. This extends to tanks ~~(The Abrams uses a [turbine](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine-electric_transmission)!)~~ and some busses.<br><br>The concept is now being revisited in other areas, mostly looking for fuel economy reasons. [Zytek](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zytek) develops a diesel-electric powertrain system. The Chevy Volt technically matches this description in certain modes. <br><br>Personally, I<sq>m still waiting on the electric cars with individual wheel motors, with a diesel APU for range extension. Put a battery capable of 35 miles on a charge in there and let the diesel handle the rest. Bam, 800 mile range electric car. For some reason it<sq>s just not being built <colon>(<br><br>Edit<colon> I read somewhere the Abrams tank uses a turbine-electric system, but this appears to be incorrect. Instead, check out [this Diesel turbine powered truck](http<colon>//www.wired.com/2014/09/fedex-wrightspeed-diesel-ev-trucks/) FedEx is looking at.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Having done exactly this, here is my advice.<br><br>TL;DR<colon> Take the hourly rate your employer charges customers, set that as your bare minimum and ask for some more. In your shoes you get to set the upper limit on negotiations so don<sq>t start any less than your current billable rate. Also, cover your ass, your employer is currently covering it for you.<br><br>At a BARE MINIMUM you will need to charge them the same hourly rate they would bill you out as an employee. Just to keep the numbers easy, lets say you made $50/hour as an employee before taxes. Tack on top of that insurance, overhead to deal with billing clients, time to deal with invoice disputes, etc. Your employer is probably billing you out at $150-$200+ an hour to account for all of their expenses involved in having you as an employee. Based on your description it sounds like you have the upper hand in negotiations, so I wouldn<sq>t skimp on your starting number. If you are billed out at $200 start at $250 or $300. Worst case you end up with $200, best case you make more.<br><br>To be quite frank an honest, your <dq>salary<dq> as far as your take home pay is kind of a bullshit number. Yes, it is what you live on, but from the employer perspective there are a lot of other costs involved having you as an employee. Your true worth, at least in the eyes of your employer, is whatever they are charging customers for your hourly rate.<br><br>You also need to account for self employment tax. This is the portion of your taxes paid by your employer that you never see as an employee. I<sq>m not from NY so I<sq>m not sure about state requirements, but you also probably need to account for state self employment tax too. <br><br>Again, NY may be different, but you also probably need to account for unemployment insurance. This is a percentage of your wages that goes to the state pool of unemployment dollars. You want the real kicker? You likely will not ever be able to collect unemployment yourself from your time being self employed. Frustrating, but it is what it is.<br><br>The other benefit your employer has that you don<sq>t need to worry about as an employee is professional liability insurance. Sure you *can* work without it, but if you blow up a plant, or someone sues you, or any number of other things, you will have a big hole to potentially dig yourself out of. Account for this cost. <br><br>In addition, you may or may not need to worry about health insurance. Calculate out the penalty vs. a plan, either way it is going to cost you some money.<br><br>Depending on how you set things up you can get some tax breaks, look into S Corporations, owner draw/dividends on that approach. Basically you can save the self employment tax on SOME of the money you earn.<br><br>You should probably ask an accountant/lawyer about this for your specific case, but I would also recommend setting up a business entity to keep your business income COMPLETELY separate from your personal income, then pay yourself as an employee/owner of the company. See the previous point about getting sued. If you have everything separate and someone sues the business entity it is harder for them to get at your personal assets than if you are using personal finances for everything. If you do this, account for the time/cost of doing payroll as part of your hourly wage, your employer definitely is.<br><br>As a contractor you will also get some other deductions like travel expenses, cell phone, home office, etc. Look into this, and save all of your receipts.<br><br>Back to the employer benefits side, specifically dealing with the automation world. Unless you set up some sort of agreement in advance, you may need to account for software licensing. For example, if you work primarily with Rockwell/Allen Bradley or Wonderware or Siemens products, you will need to have access to their licensing for your development purposes. If you aren<sq>t able to use their licenses, don<sq>t have a license you can borrow from a customer, etc. you will need to procure the right licensing. Repeat this advice for tech support. <br><br>Cover your ass. Get everything in writing, if you can, have a lawyer read over things before you sign them. Likely your employer has a lawyer looking over their side of things. <br><br>Things to specifically cover, in some level of detail<colon> <br><br>1. Customer interactions - If you do work for a customer on a project through your former employer who gets billed? Once that project is over and the customer calls you for a second project, can you bill them directly and cut your employer out of the deal or do you need to keep the same relationships in place?<br>2. Software licensing, support, office space, office supplies, etc. Be detailed, last thing you want is the employer sending you a bill for your portion of the utilities, rent, etc. if you are in their space for any amount of time.<br>3. Travel expenses - who pays your expenses on a project with travel? Do you get reimbursed, does the customer get charged, what rates do you get for per diem, hotel, etc.<br>4. Overtime - likely right now you get paid overtime if you have to work +40 hours a week, do you charge a different rate to your employer after X number of hours? This can get into some legal gray areas in terms of responsibilities so maybe include this in your lawyer discussion.<br>5. Back to customers, see distributors. If the Rockwell guy calls you for a project directly, who gets the project revenue? See item 1 above for further discussion.<br>6. Trademark, trade secrets, proprietary information. Dictate any employer resources you get to take with you on future projects, no need to have this bite you in the ass 6 months from now.<br>7. How the relationship can/should/will end, from both sides, including durational limits if needed. Again, 6 months from now you don<sq>t want to be in a position of expecting to get 3 more months of pay and your employer drops you once they bring someone on board.<br>8. Probably won<sq>t get much by asking for holidays, but your hourly rate the employer charges customers also includes holiday pay, wrapped up in the calculation of your hourly take home pay. Take this into account as that could be anywhere from 7-13 days (or less or more) depending on how you have things set up that you won<sq>t be getting as a contractor.<br><br>That is everything I can think of off the top of my head. <br><br>My advice? Make some money, do it as long as you want to and then branch out on your own or find someone who you would enjoy working for. Like Paul Graham of Y Combinator says, being your own boss is like getting punched in the face repeatedly but working for someone else is like being waterboarded.<br><br>Good luck!

Axial engines can be small and conveniently sized, but thats about it.  They vibrate and can<sq>t be balanced easily.  The swashplate is also a large, complicated, and less efficient component compared to a crankshaft.  These two factors combined mean it requires a lot of maintenance and can<sq>t be run at high speeds.  The rotating cylinders also make cooling hard, since you can<sq>t pipe in as easily.  The fact that the cylinders have to seal at the top and slide at the same time guarantees they will 1. burn massive amounts of oil 2. wear super quickly 3. leak and 4. be a lot more susceptible to getting coolant in the pistons and blowing the fuck up.<br><br>Theres no reason this setup should have better compression or less predetonation, and it would probably be much worse due to the cooling issues.  It *could maybe* have slightly better ignition characteristics since you can have plugs and valves in different places, giving you more room to spread stuff out. <br><br><br>edit<colon> also, extremely high inertia, very high idle, and slow acceleration, since you<sq>re basically spinning up the engine block as well as moving the pistons.  Thats a huge amount of mass.<br><br>edit 2<colon> a pro<colon> you can adjust the swing of the swashplate to change your compression ratio by a small amount, so with some modification these engines could swap fuel instantaneously.  nobody cares though, because that isn<sq>t useful</p>",

You apply a presse and they respond instantly. Gases require you to work (compress them) to increase pressure.<br><br>Gases store a lot of energy as pressure (because they compress like a spring) and that kind of spring energy is easy to extract.<br><br>Now let<sq>s see what we need to do for a basic power cycle, Stat with a cool fluid, compress it, heat it, expand it while capturing energy, coll it back to state one (lost heat).<br><br>Supercritical fluids never undergo a phase change between liquid and gas. They just expand or compress until they behave more like one or the other. So you take a cool dense fluid (like a liquid), you pump it to a high pressure easily (without a lot of entropy increase which would result in loss of efficiency). Then you heat it (it<sq>s dense so it heats easily). This heat expands it to amore gas like state (more springy).

Because the retreating blade has a higher AoA already, it will be the first part of the disc to experience Stall; what occurs when the AoA is so high that the blade no longer generates any lift at all. As a result the retreating blade will stop generating lift while the attacking blade still does, causing the helicopter to tilt to the left (in a normal right-to-left helicopter; tilts to the right in a Eurocopter or some others). If this is not corrected it will cause the helicopter to tilt past it<sq>s recoverable point and crash.</p>",

Mach number limits are due to shock waves (either preventing them from forming in bad places on a commercial airliner, or from getting too strong and causing heat problems on a supersonic jet).<br><br>For indicated airspeed, the problem is basically that the dynamic pressure gets too high. You have two potential problems<colon> the usual limit is flutter, which people have mentioned. You also eventually get <dq>divergence<dq>, which is when the wings rip off.<br><br>The yield strength of a material is a pressure, so the yield strength of a structure is also based on a pressure. As the dynamic pressure in the flow increases, the ratio between the yield strength and the dynamic pressure decreases. In a higher-speed flow, the wing is basically weaker.<br><br>This causes two problems<colon> in reality, flight isn<sq>t entirely steady-state. The wing shudders slightly. As you go faster, the wing shudders more, because relative to the air, it<sq>s flimsier, and gets pushed around more. Eventually, it starts flapping so much that the structure is endangered, or the wings start stalling.<br><br>The second problem is divergence. Flutter generally happens at a lower speed, so this is generally not a practical issue, but it<sq>s still an upper limit. If you fly at the correct angle of attack, you can fly level no matter what your speed is, which means you<sq>re producing lift equal to the weight of the aircraft. So lift isn<sq>t the problem.<br><br>The problem is that the wing doesn<sq>t just produce lift. It also produces a twisting moment around the axis of the wing. As you go faster, even though you<sq>re producing the same lift, that moment gets bigger. Eventually, it<sq>ll get too big for the structure, and rip the wing off.

I don<sq>t have many direct answers for you, but let<sq>s take a cruise through what we do today versus what 48V would do, and observe some of the differences<colon><br><br>In all cases, there<sq>s probably high voltage coming to the site (I dunno, > ~60kV, say?). This gets stepped down to probably three legs of 277 via big transformers. In some cases this goes through some huge static transfer switches to allow failover to generators. This AC voltage goes to each system, which runs a power supply to step down to 12V and 5V, which is fed to power supplies right next to the load (cpu, gpu) where a point-of-load switch turns it into a ~1v perhaps 100+ amp source for the core.<br><br>There<sq>s a couple things that run differently in 48V. The substation to switch down could be setup with a different ratio that could perhaps better feed the 48V-out power supplies. Instead of needing dozens of power supplies per rack, each using some of the rack<sq>s cooling budget, there can be some significant consolidation into big 48V sources, saving a lot of space, materials, cost over many power supplies. Instead of producing a range of 12V and 5V sources, the power supply can produce one drive voltage, which is simpler. Since the output voltage is higher, I tend to think the power factor could be better- you<sq>re not trying to use a fire hose of 277V to trickle out a faint 5V signal<colon> you can let loose more potential and step down at a much smaller ratio. Current is massively less for the same power, which usually translates to smaller passives (capacitors, inductors).<br><br>Instead of having generation capabilities and massive massive transfer switches for switchover, individual or sets of racks have their own battery backups as needed. I don<sq>t think there<sq>s a ton of loss in most static transfer switches, but there is some and a battery supply system- aside from some maintence charge/discharge cycles and small losses- should be very very power efficient, mostly just sitting there. More/smaller switches is a different kind of risk profile than big static transfer switches, diffusing a big capital construction cost anchoring the data center<sq>s power system out into local switches. Beyond switching, maintence/likeliness-to-work is more predictable for batteries than with generators<colon> less moving parts, can check each battery supply & charge/ discharge circuit individually & at a range of power-delivery capacities often. And when you are drawing batteries, the batteries can be setup to directly provide the asked for 48V, or something real close. For example, a 12S li-ion pack goes from 50V charged to mid 40<sq>s disrchaged which may be an acceptable range.<br><br>What actually has to go on the motherboard is the point of load power supply, the ~1V supply for the cores. I believe the notion is, in this future 48V world, that the point of load step down would be fed directly on the 48V power. I don<sq>t see any clear advantages to this. There are a lot of new technologies on the field that open up 48V whereas clasically it would require some hefty mosfets to switch this- eGan (gallium-nitride) FET for example has somewhat higher internal resistance for current flowing through it (more power loss), but the gate charge is at least an order of magnitude less, meaning it<sq>s way way easier to turn on and off, and the wide bandgap makes it far better at switching higher voltages, all of which means far far faster switching devices working at far higher voltages, and- perhaps importantly- capable of dealing with noisier or ripplier 48V source power, which, if true, would allow the 48v supply to cost-down and increase-efficiency quite significantly<colon> the high switching speed lets it adapt to the more chaotic source faster, better.<br><br>If you really want to peer deep into the crystal ball of the future, you need to check out what the competitors for the [Little Box Challenge](https<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/4clvn6/google_little_box_challenge_winning_inverter/) did, to understand the advanced technologies and new techniques the best enigneers in the world put together to deliver ultra-high-density switching systems.</p>",

The normal highway load model for lorries and cars corresponds to a structure used by traffic associated with an international port - i.e. the worst case in Europe.  These cover the global effects on the bridge. Local effects (including accidental loads) are considered using a single axle which is a bit heavier than the axles in the normal load model. Also, there are <sq>special vehicles<sq> - for example, a power station turbine which are transported on separate bogies, but could be expected to use a main highway. And there is pedestrian loading. These four load models are there combined in groups (and factored differently and other variable actions are included) and moved around the bridge in order to capture the worst case envelope for each component on the structure. <br><br>Dynamic effects are accounted for by factoring the base actions and at least one of the groups included longitudinal and transverse loading. The effects of resonance is a bit beyond what I do but generally it<sq>s down to modelling and I don<sq>t think the code says much about it.<br><br>Now then... what has probably happened here is that a new Eurocode assessment has been carried out on the structure - possibly due to a concern raised from inspection, or just because it got old enough to warrant one. I don<sq>t know quite how Germany operates with regards to assessments, but in the UK we don<sq>t used Eurocodes because they aren<sq>t really set up to handle assessments, and we are still using the British Standards, which have supplementary codes to assist in assessing older structures. It could be<colon><br><br>1) the more onerous loading of the Eurocodes (compared to the older DIN) has highlighted the potential for buckling<br>2) the original design intent has been lost and the bridge just fails hard when applied to a modern code<br>3) it was a bad design and the highway authorities are nervous about it<br><br>It<sq>s probably a mix of 1 and 2. The Eurocode loading is quite onerous and the UK National Annex reduces to loading to a level comparable to the old British Standards (within a percentage point), just so new bridges didn<sq>t have to be made stronger and so when assessments are transitioned to the new codes, all the old bridges don<sq>t fail! I suspect Germany would have done something similar but maybe not for assessments.<br><br>I doubt the bridge is in danger of falling down but the the load models are more onerous for a reason - traffic is much heavier than the 1960s  - so bridges are treated with some caution as a failure is obviously catastrophic.<br><br>On just a related but interesting note, the UK and Germany are the only two countries to have a complete list of all their structures and to have a structured system of inspection and regular assessments.

Note my units are in american units and we use kips and kip ft.<br><br>The loads bridges are designed to take are all of them you can think of with focus being given to certain ones based on location. These loads are broken down into the categories of dead and live loads. Dead loads are loads that are permanent which include the loads from concrete, steel, utilities etc. The calculation of the dead loads are then further broken down into the categories of composite dead loads, noncomposite deadloads and the dead load of the wearing surface. The reason for this is because while the bridge is under construction certain loads will be acting upon only the steel components (non composite). Such as the steel self weight and diaphragm self weight. Once the deck is in place the dead loads act on the structure as a whole (composite). Such as the loads from the sidewalks, deck, parapets etc... Note this is how it works for a regular steel grider with composite concrete deck bridge, things can change depending on the type of bridge. For example if the bridge is fully concrete then there will be no consideration for non composite dead load or if the deck isnt composite with the steel girders. <br><br>The next set of loads that are considered are live loads. These include dynamic loading from wind, earthquake, and as you mentioned vehicular loads. <br><br>Specifically on vehicular loads bridges are analyzed using a standard HL-93 truck loading. This truck has 3 axles with the loadings of 8 kips on the front axle, and 32 kips on the last 2 axles. The spacing between the 32 kips axles are 14 feet and we also consider the spacing at 30 feet. The next type of truck we consider is a tandem truck which is just 2 axles with 25 kips on each axle spaced 5 feet apart. We also consider and double truck configuration with two hl-93 vehicles spaced 50 feet apart. <br><br>These trucks are then run across the lanes of the bridge with each truck configuration being considered seperately. We look for the configuration that cause the maximum moment in the bridge and that will be the moment used for the rest of the bridge analysis. Impact loding from the vehicles moving are included here and with current modeling we can simulate what type of moments the bridge will see during and accident. Note the loads are just the start of the bridge analysis steps. And i only briefly explained some things feel free to ask more questions and i would gladly clarify. <br><br>In america the standard guidelines are set by asshto (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) highway bridge design and the methods used to analyze bridge include are usually lrfd and lfd.</p>",

One day their dumbass game came to a horrifying end when a round with a cardboard wad was fired, lodging it deep in the abdomen of the unsuspecting victim.  <br>The point being, yes you can kill someone with rice if you aim at a shallow vital area and you are able to get the barrel within a foot of them....because if the rice doesn<sq>t get them, the wad will.  My reasoning is that most of the ballistics tests I have seen as well as known local fatalities, lightweight #8 lead birdshot cannot penetrate skin over 55 meters with a fatal range of 3 meters to a shallow vital.  FBI 10 ft test only shows 3-5 inches of penetration by #8 birdshot, with wicked damage to the first inch.  Tests with salt loads aren<sq>t impressive either with most of the salt bouncing off the skin. Considering dry rice has less density than lead and the velocity gain in the load from a lighter projectile isn<sq>t going to overcome it, results would probably be poor and not fatal. Sounds like a fun ballistic gelatin test.<br><br>TL;DR Not fatal unless you are aiming at the carotids in the neck or some shallow target and no more than a few feet (1-2) away.  Might get under the skin and chafe a little from further away, but we need a ballistic gelatin test to know for sure. I think clothing would keep most of it out.</p>",

Getting water down the air vent is not going to be good. <br><br>* Maintenance is a nightmare. Current washers/dryers are relatively simple and easy to fix now. If they are combined the resistance heater probably needs to be in a waterproof enclosure. All the plumbing will have to be somewhat intertwined and hard to access. Any seal failure will severely damage the unit - O-rings do not last forever. <br><br>* It<sq>s either going to be a huge unit, or the same size as a normal unit with tiny capacity due to all of the extra guts.<br><br>* Laundry will take twice as long for multiple loads. Say you<sq>ve got 4 loads of clothes and washing/drying are an hour each. With a combined unit that takes 8 hours.

One major drawback International ran into was that unless the valve is operating near valve float, the valve returns most of the energy required to open it back to the cam. It actually take surprisingly little power to run a camshaft under normal circumstances. The hydraulic pump to operate the valves became much of a burden on the system as it was difficult to recover the energy.  I think where Koenigsegg stands to gain is the elimination of the spring so it takes very little force to operate the valve so the loss can be written off.</p>",

Let<sq>s guess a plane takes ~3,000 different parts (probably a reasonable number, no less than 300).

You<sq>re pretty close but consider this<colon> does your formula work if I have a needle thin cable, a shoelace thick cable or an arm thick cable?  You need to use the volume of the cable  cross sectional area by length. <br><br>So now we are more correctly approximating the weight of that cable.

That<sq>s 400 Mega Pascals. 400x10^6 N/m\u00b2.<br><br>So we now know the force on the cable from the mass of the cable and how much force it can take before breaking. If you just leave Length as a variable in that formula you can try figure the max L. Yes you can vary your area too.. A larger area means more force can be held but it<sq>ll also increase your mass..

The closer the blades are to the cylinder (sometimes called a blade track, or a seal segment, or whatever a particular company may call it), the better it is for efficiency.

The maximum deceleration gives you a maximum force (F=ma, and the mass of the car is known); the force is determined by the cross-sectional area of the honeycomb.

Bank accounts are not anonymous, and for each transaction, one bank issues a payment, another receives the payment, the credit card clearing house has a record of the transaction, the merchant<sq>s POS system has a record too, and everyone can easily verify the details of the transaction against everyone else involved during audits. In particular, the customer/user sees their statement, and can flag problems.<br><br>For e-Voting, the act of casing a vote must be secret. That means when I user clicks <dq>candidate A for office<dq> or <dq>No on ballot issue 20<dq>, no record associating that persons vote with the tally may be kept, or else it becomes possible to learn how someone voted. You must rely entirely on a single machine to keep an accurate tally, and that tally cannot be cross-checked and verified later against some other system.<br><br>Yes, open source security software allows experts to audit the code to insure it<sq>s free of errors, vulnerabilities, and malicious hidden features, and is a good thing generally. That<sq>s all great as far as it goes, but it<sq>s just one good brick and you want to build a house.  How do you ensure to the average voter that software is indeed what<sq>s running on the machine? In fact, if an e-Voting machine is hacked at the BIOS level, it could indeed be the audited, open source software running, but the BIOS is playing VM tricks to alter the vote outcome somehow.<br><br>It<sq>s also *efficient* to hack a voting machine for an attacker. IT<sq>s certainly possible to hack a traditional paper ballot voting system, accusations like that fly around whenever there<sq>s a close election, that one side or the other may have discarded ballots, double-counted, etc. The difficulty is those sorts of hacks are rarely *systemic* -- you<sq>ve got to hack into each ballot box, which only hold a few thousand ballots, one at a time, and repeat the procedure for many, many ballot boxes to significantly change the outcome of the election.<br><br>Hacking the software or communications of an e-Voting system is on the other hand very *efficient* for an attacker. If I can slip in my malicious source code, or hack the systems en-masse, I can now make subtle, but widespread changes to the voting tally. Many election decisions are quite close, and just a few percentage change across many eVoting machines can throw the election one way or the other. Really good hacks would then erase their presence after their work is complete, leaving a seemingly original system in place. How would someone then challenge these results?<br><br>To be truly secure, you want an eVoting system that has a paper or other tangible trail. A voter enters their choices in the machine on each issue or question, reviews the results on screen, then presses <dq>complete<dq> and the system prints out a ballot card that<sq>s human-and-machine readable. The voter can see for themselves on the ballot that their votes were correctly registered, then they drop the ballot into a lock box. <br><br>Now, the machine knows what the citizen voted, and thus can keep tally or count for instant transmission to the central election authority over secure and authenticated transmission methods. There now exists, however, a tangible, human readable record, so that the votes can be sampled randomly against the machine<sq>s counts, to ensure accuracy in the machine<sq>s electronic result. A losing candidate or propositions supporters can lobby a court to manually count the ballot votes, if there<sq>s indication of fraud, or even just so that you can shut down conspiracy theorists by a public count.<br><br>A paper trail of ballots also ensures that votes won<sq>t be lost if the voting machine has a failure and crashes. Doesn<sq>t even have to be a software failure -- hardware fails too.<br><br>None of these ideas are original with me, by the way, many people including security technologists have thought about them for many years.<br><br>TL;DR -- secure eVoting is possible, but requires well thought and designed processes and equipment, and is hardly unsolved because someone hasn<sq>t thought hard enough about it yet.<br><br></p>",

By this reasoning, the maximum force you can push on the ground with is likely equivalent to or below your bodyweight (otherwise your shoes will just be slipping on the pavement). since we aleady established that the air drag on a human at 120mph is equivalent to that humans body weight, i would guess that your shoes would be slipping before you reached that speed.<br><br>Now, let<sq>s talk about softer shoes. If you want to exceed a coefficient of 1.0, you can use very soft rubber shoes. However, even the softest rubber imaginable (think<colon> silly putty) won<sq>t get you above 4, and since the air drag is a factor of speed squared it will only buy you 240 mph.

However, the fore mentioned issue with rubber heating up and melting becomes an proportionally larger issue with higher force applied to the ground. You could try plastic/composite/steel soled shoes, but then your coefficient of friction on asphalt/concrete will go down significantly.<br><br>keep in mind, all of this assumes you are perfectly varying your horizontal force to avoid under-accelerating or slipping as the vertical force on your feet goes up and down.</p>",

Learning and acquiring experience is a lifelong thing - you should spend part of every week thinking about how to improve what you do (and what your company does).<br><br>- Not thinking for yourself. The reason why seasoned engineers give you a task, and get you to try it yourself, is exactly the same as the whole <sq>give a man a fish vs. teach the man to fish<sq> saying. As a more senior engineer, you won<sq>t have someone watching over your shoulder all the time. You will never learn the solution to every problem through experience, so a BIG part of engineering experience is learning problem solving itself. And, how to have confidence in your ability to do so. Yes, ask questions, but make sure you have actually had a proper go first. If you think you lack confidence in your own work or ability to solve problems, then this is something you need to consciously focus on.<br><br>- Several of the items above lead to the consequence of *making up solutions*. The final stage of the bad engineer, is where you have given up on continued learning, you are happy to ignore problems with your own work, and you don<sq>t want to think critically for and about yourself. Thus, you provide designs that are sub-standard, wrong, and potentially unsafe.

Obviously, keep in mind that what you are designing must be built (i.e. it needs to go together, it must be practical, it must be safe to assemble etc.). Also, keep in mind that someone is paying for the item (easy for you to spec. something expensive).

I am an economist, and while this is not my specialty, I think we need to fully evaluate the implications of alternative energy on the market for fossil fuels.<br><br>If you think of electricity, i.e. the product of solar plants, wind farms, coal power plants, etc., as the product of generation, you will see that electricity is a homogenous good. For all intents and purposes, the end-user does not care if it came from a coal plant or a solar plant because it all does the same thing. If you could box it up and put it on the shelf, the only difference is the source. The function is exactly the same. Furthermore, if there are multiple sources, there<sq>s no reliable way to know whose electricity the consumer is actually buying.<br><br>Now, let<sq>s assume the quantity of electricity produced by fossil fuel methods does not change over the period we<sq>re talking about. However, solar power becomes much more efficient, and therefore much cheaper to produce. So we expect the quantity of electricity produced by solar plants to increase. As any elementary economics student will tell you, an increase in total quantity supplied, all other things equal, will cause the price to fall.<br><br>Because electricity is a homogenous good (all electricity in the grid does the same thing) this means that the price of *all* electricity will fall. This implies that quantity consumed of *all* forms of electricity will rise, including fossil fuel based methods. So by making more clean energy, you may actually cause more fossil fuel based production. The actual outcome depends on the price elasticity of demand for electricity.<br><br>So how do we solve this problem? By making fossil fuels more expensive. This is the only way to ensure that the optimal long-run quantity of electricity is produced, and it will give electricity producers (and fossil fuel producers) real incentives to pursue alternatives. In fact, a price increase is the only way to accomplish this in any meaningful way because we must assume that for-profit actors will maximize profit given the market conditions they face. This is actually quite easily accomplished through Pigovian taxes. Pigou<sq>s theory of market externalities basically states that if any party imposes externalities on society, that party should be taxed such that the quantity supplied adjusts so as to produce the socially optimal quantity. So basically, if fossil fuel producers and consumers were forced to internalize the environmental costs of their actions via a tax, they would quickly find cleanear alternatives, and the problem would be solved endogenously.

Engineer-artists like Leonardo da Vinci simply did not have the math and science tools and knowledge to build things like steam engines or flying machines. <br><br>The primary <dq>calculation<dq> methods were<colon><br><br>* Geometric similarity<br>* Ratios of measure<br>* Arithmetic calculation<br><br>Things that didn<sq>t exist<colon><br><br>* Algebra (not part of the West until Arab/Indian knowledge was introduced to the West - <dq>al gebra<dq> is an Arabic word.<br>* Trigonometry (lost knowledge recovered/saved from the Arabs)<br>* Calculus (no differential equations, etc., which are the basis of most engineering today)<br><br>Plus the science knowledge derived from<colon><br><br>* Systematic knowledge of materials (materials constants)<br>* Reliable chemical and physical models of materials and systems - equations describing behaviors using (minimally) algebra and materials constants<br><br>Where this bites you is in *compressible* fluid mechanics, combustion physics/chemistry and most forms of material engineering required for non-room-temperature materials and system (i.e. what you need for heat engines - of which steams engines are a subclass).  <br><br>Steam, air and high temperature combustion products of piston and turbine machines of various types all involve nonlinear compressible fluids with complex phase behaviors that were beyond the mathematics of the time.  <br><br>Much of the mathematics (e.g. Navier-Stokes, calculus, steam tables, etc.) to understand these and reliable calculate did not exist until the mid-19th century.  Some empirical knowledge existed in the 18th century but there was no systematized science to back it up as a reliable engineering skill.<br><br>You can<sq>t work with simple geometric and ratio based calculations for this - though they can work for incompressible fluids (hence hydraulics was relatively well established, but steam and air heat machines were not).  Similarly for rigid bodies (stone, wood, etc.) you can generally work well enough with ratio-based calculations as well (as long as you stay within the elastic region which is pretty linear for most materials).  Plastic deformation was always an empirical null design result (cathedrals and bridges failed and were rebuilt with 2x the prior design until they stood).<br><br>You can pretty much explain why most of da Vinci<sq>s most fanciful inventions could never be implemented because they involved exactly the things you could NOT use the (ancient) engineering methodologies for.  The things of da Vinci that did work in practice/construction all uniformly do involve materials and processes that are able to be predicted with the methods and knowledge available at the time.<br><br>So basic wood and later metal working and machines used in clocks mostly are within the realm of ancient/medieval design techniques that worked since classical times with stone, wood and metal.  So these are what arrived first.<br><br>And then there were the economic incentives.  Ship-based trade that optimally needed time-based navigation was already common by the 16th century - as soon as you cross lines of longitude, you need time-keeping such as clocks and watches for navigation (unless you can manage to hug the shore always keep land in sight).<br><br>There was no comparable need for <dq>steam engines<dq> or the energy conversion they provided.  Wind power was still sufficient.  And even steam wasn<sq>t viable for shipping until the 19th century despite land-based steam engines existing in niche applications (e.g. Lycoming<sq>s mine water pump engines).</p>",

[Here](http<colon>//imgur.com/87xZwTw) is a look at one of the pieces of equipment, sorry for the quality. There is basically one company in the US that handles derailments like this because of the type of equipment required. </p>",

This includes companies that physically remove the train, air monitoring specialists, and environmental consultants to oversee the entire clean-up process.

There are typically two, one called the brake pipe, the other called the brake cylinder. Both are usually air pressurized up to somewhere between 70-110+ psi depending on the company and region/country. When you initiate a stop with the brake pipe (the one I<sq>m a little more familiar with, but still not very) it dumps all the air and the brake clamps (and cannot be repressurized and therefore released) until the train is fully stopped. These have been in use, virtually unmodified, since 10-20 years after either the steam or diesel locomotive was invented. (on mobile now so I can<sq>t easily double check my references. It<sq>s a surprisingly old setup)<br><br>Why? Because they work, for the main purpose of many train systems<colon> reliably coming to a full stop in case of an emergency.

It<sq>s somewhat funny when you consider the price tag of a brand new locomotive cab/engine, (a few million) but even the most basic failure/accident has a lot of potential for lots of really bad and/or expensive repercussions.

As far as dealing with tarps that tear easily at the grommets, I have two suggestions that I have used successfully at Burning Man with large shitty tarps in high wind.  As you have learned, tarp grommets tear out easily.  You have two basic alternatives that I know of.<br><br>1.  You can ignore the grommets completely and use <sq>buttons<sq>. Basically, you put a small stone or other object just in from the tarp edge, gather the tarp around it and tie a tight a knot around the gather.  Anything that stays tight is good, I usually just use a few half hitches.*  It is far less likely to rip out than the shitty grommets. <br><br>2.  The other, better option, is to string the entire side.  Basically you run two lines along the edge of the tarp.  At each grommet you tie a loop through one line, feed it through the grommet and run the second line on the side through the loop.  You want the loops to be as small as possible to avoid slacking.  Any loop knot that doesn<sq>t slip will work, a basic <sq>loop knot<sq> is easiest.  http<colon>//www.camping-field-guide.com/loop-knot.html  Tie all your anchors to the the lines, not the grommets.  That way you will distribute any wind loads along all the lines and grommets instead of it being focused on just one.  It is a time consuming pain in the ass to do this.  But you can use fairly small diameter cord and you only need to do it once. I have tarps I<sq>ve used over and over again strung this way using mason line that have held up in 70mph wind.  Although those were 20x30, so you might want to use something stronger, like 550.<br><br>*If you only ever learn to tie one know, learn the half hitch.  It is easy as hell and fantastic in a great many situations</p>",

The only issue was that they could not spin the threads into fibers with properties that were even close to spider silk. The technology simply wasn\u2019t there yet. Also, since they could only get a couple ounces of proteins out of each milking and the time that it takes to breed the goats to make more \u201cspider goats\u201d, they were limited in what they could do with the proteins. They found that some of them worked well in cosmetics and sold some fibers to fashion designer [Sruli Recht](http<colon>//store.srulirecht.com/collections/all/spider-silk) to weave into clothing, but nothing that came close to commercial scale. Eventually, they went bankrupt, but the idea did not die.<br><br>One of the lead scientists from the project, Randy Lewis, started working in collaboration with silkworm specialist and professor of microbiology Donald Jarvis, gene splicing expert and co-inventor of the PiggyBac gene splicing method Malcolm Fraser, and an entrepreneur and business lawyer, Kim Thompson, in order to put the spider genes in Bombyx mori silkwroms to make them spin spider silk fibers naturally. They formed the company **[Kraig Biocraft Laboratories Inc.](http<colon>//www.kraiglabs.com/)** and had a [breakthrough in 2010](http<colon>//www.pnas.org/content/109/3/923.long), creating silkworms that are able to make silk that is much stronger than normal (though not quite as strong as spider silk) that they dubbed \u201cMonster Silk\u201d. <br><br>Since then, they have used other gene transferal methods to create even stronger silks, one of their most recent rivalling the strongest natural spider silk known to man, the dragline of the Darwin Bark Spider, at over 2 GPa tensile strength. They entered into a cooperative contract with Technichal Textile maker [Warwick Mills](http<colon>//www.warwickmills.com/) and started scaling up to commercialization back in 2013, but ran into quality issues with their silk due to environmental factors here in the USA, so had to hold back production as a result. To overcome these issues, they started working with the Government of Vietnam to move their operations there, where environmental factors are more what they silkworms are used to. Finally, at the end of 2015, [they finally reached an agreement with the government of Vietnam](http<colon>//www.talkvietnam.org/2016/03/american-spider-silk-manufacturer-invests-in-vietnam/) to set up a subsidiary and move commercial operations there which they are currently in the process of doing.<br><br>During this time, Professor Randy Lewis was offered a position at Utah State University to head up their Department of Biology and be a chair in their Synthetic Biomolecules Center there. He accepted and moved there with the goats from the by then defunct Nexia Biotechnology. He left Kraig Biocraft Labs to start up his own company there called **[Araknitek Inc.](http<colon>//www.araknitek.com/)** and, while still working with the goats, has created his own silkworms as well as transgenic alfalfa and E.coli. Most recently, he has developed some [spider silk adhesives](http<colon>//digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&context=roch) that are biocompatible and hold better than super glue.<br><br>These are not the only companies pursuing commercializing spider silks. Most notably, Japan\u2019s Tsuruoka based **[Spiber Inc.](https<colon>//www.spiber.jp/en/)** has constructed factories that can produce and weave several tons of spider silk proteins created from their own transgenic bacteria into textiles as well as automobiles and medical applications. Last year, they entered into a contract with [Goldwin Inc.](http<colon>//www.goldwin.co.jp/tnf/special/spiber/moon_parka/), the Japanese distributor for The North Face Inc. and created the [Moon Parka](http<colon>//www.spoon-tamago.com/2015/10/20/moon-parka-outerwear-made-from-synthetic-spider-silk/). It will be available this year in limited quantities in the Japanese market and will likely be the first transgenic spider silk textile available to purchase commercially.<br><br>San Francisco based **[Bolt Threads Inc.](https<colon>//boltthreads.com/)** is another company that is on the verge of commercialization. They have found that using transgenic yeast allows for better gene transference and more protein generation than standard E.coli, so they have been working with it to generate the proteins to weave into threads for textiles. They are working with North Carolina based [Unifi Inc.](http<colon>//unifi.com/) to work their fibers into textiles which should also be commercially available sometime this year.<br><br>Other companies are also in the mix. Ones that use transgenic E.Coli are German Based [AMSilk GmbH](https<colon>//www.amsilk.com/home/) which has had a limited sales of spider silk cosmetics in the past and Swedish based [Spiber Technologies AB](http<colon>//www.spiber.se/) (no connection to the Japanese Spiber Inc.) which is looking into medical applications. Transgenic silkworm producers include North Carolina based [Entogenetics Inc.](http<colon>//www.entogenetics.com/) which is currently in contract with the military to produce blast packs for them, Japan Based [Okamoto Corporation]( http<colon>//www.okamotogroup.com/en/) which simply wants to create more luxurious socks, and the new Japan based Isanago Inc. which is hoping to incorporate their silks into space suits or robotic ligaments. There are even others such as [Oxford Biomaterials Ltd.]( http<colon>//www.oxfordbiomaterials.com/) and their subsidiaries which rely on physical modifications to silkworms and [Cocoon Biotech Inc.](http<colon>//www.oxfordbiomaterials.com/) which hopes to inject biocompatible silk proteins into joints to help relieve arthritis symptoms.<br><br>I know it has been a long wait for commercial spider silk products, but the light at the end of the tunnel is in sight. Hopefully, by the end of the decade, they will be commonplace.

Spider silk is amazingly complex, being composed of many different proteins. The last I heard, the most advanced artificial spider silk we can create only includes a small portion of these proteins, and is much weaker than actual spider silk. Unfortunately if you want spider silk that is stronger than already existing materials, you need to pull it out of a spider<sq>s backside. To get enough silk to make anything useful, you need a massive spider farm, which, in addition to being terrifying, is also not very economical because spiders will eat each other if held in captivity together. So until we make some serious improvements in genetic engineering, spider silk is not really an engineering material.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Before going on to do a PhD I worked in industry for 5 years.  In that time I filled 3 roles; Mechanical Design Engineer, Design Engineer II, and CFD Engineer.  The last was after doing a MSME.<br><br>What did I notice?  Well, during the first two jobs I had a BS.  Very little math and science was involved, and an awful lot of CAD, paper pushing, and going by specs already written by someone else.  For some people this was great.  For some it was just a well paying job.  Nothing wrong with that.  There was some creativity in the design process.  But I felt bored and that that was not what I went to school for.<br><br>So I went on to do a MSME, knowing I really wanted to do CFD/NHT.  Could I have moved into a more advanced analysis job without the MSME?  Unlikely.  As much as I had a passion for it, and attempted to learn it myself, there was a barrier without guidance and resources.  Also, there was no one at a job to learn from, everywhere wanted you to come in being prepared to hit hte ground running, and do more than just follow a rule book.  So I had to learn the fundamentals really well and be flexible in applying them.  Finally some math and science!  And some research!  I got to spend a lot of time reading research publications on the latest methods and models and attempt to discern if they were appropriate to our physics/numerical stability/speed needs.  Damn good thing I had the MS going into that job!  And no one there to help me.  Also, no one there to lay a groundwork and control what I had to do.<br><br>But then there was a nagging feeling that I<sq>m still just a user of other peoples work.  I wanted more, to create the methods to solve unique never before resolved problems.  The groundwork for that?  Well a PhD of course!  It hasn<sq>t been education in the traditional sense, but there is no better way to get that experience.  It is like an apprenticeship for R&D.  No way I was picking up those skills on the job.  <br><br>Would it help in any of the 3 jobs I had before?  Hell no.  Work experience would count for way more.  Promotions had nothing to do with have a PhD or not.  But I didn<sq>t want to do those things anymore.  I wanted more challenge, uniqueness, freedom, and impact.<br><br>So, it seems you are toying with the idea of a PhD to get into an R&D group.  Well, no that isn<sq>t necessary.  But if you want to do the deepest work in that group you just won<sq>t be prepared without it.  I wasn<sq>t prepared for any of the major changes in job description based purely from job experience, even when being around the people who did those jobs.

I usually work closely with Engineers.<br><br>**Backstory<colon>** I worked for a Tier I automotive supplier in the mid 90<sq>s. I worked there for about a year and a half. I got hired at the tail end of the company being an awesome place to work and actually got to watch as the company decayed, crumbled and eventually closed it<sq>s doors. Towards the end comments like <dq>Well, if we disable the safeties, we can get 3 more parts per hour out of the production workers.<dq> were *extremely* common. It also lead to a human being getting permanently altered for the rest of her life.(That<sq>s another story)<br><br>**Story<colon>** This one is about the Engineers. I was initially hired in as Assistant Maintenance Manager and although my boss, the Maintenance Manager was about 25 years older than me, we had a really good working relationship.<br><br>What made it even better was that the original Engineers at this company were all awesome. I remember one of them constantly pushing me to go back to school to get my Engineering degree. But you know, sex, drugs, alcohol and partying are far more important than a quality education that can take you places...right? *Right?* (God I hate hindsight) But basically, the original engineers were a blast to work with, really great environment, jokes, they shared as much knowledge as they could with me, they taught me *a lot* and I just soaked it up. Some of these guys would even work production if the staff had too many call offs. Which really impressed me.<br><br>Anyway, the big 3 had established their QS9000 requirements and it had finally made it down to our arena. Management was clueless as to what it took to create and implement a program like this and basically pissed off the Engineers and they ended up resigning, all of them *at once.* The Engineers were already working hours well outside their salary, management cancelled their vacations and basically told them to work *more hours* without any more compensation. These were the issues I was aware of, but I didn<sq>t go to Management Meetings where things were evidently a lot worse than just what I mentioned.<br><br>Management in their infinite wisdom and desire to be cheap decided to hire new Engineers and I am not really sure where they found these guys. They were young, I think one of them was related to someone in management and *all* of them were very, very green. They looked down on the maintenance staff and commonly blew us off, didn<sq>t listen to us and in some cases insulted us. So the work environment actually went to hell. Engineering and maintenance constantly clashed.<br><br>Two of the engineers had made their way down to the production floor and needed a freshly made part from the main press. This press made the most crucial part of our product. There was only one, and it pressed out 6 pieces from a (If i remember correctly) 5 x 10 sheet of raw material. <br><br>When they asked for a fresh part, I pointed them to one of the gaylords that had freshly made parts in it. The argument then turned into the fact that they didn<sq>t want to take parts out of production. I explained to them that we had paperwork to do that, and that it was common for maintenance/engineering to grab a single part and use it, as long as we filled out the production notes out so that the production manager knew why one gaylord had an odd number in it, everything would be fine.<br><br>They said they would press their own during the production worker<sq>s break. I tried telling them that they couldn<sq>t press just one part. If the press head came down and basically stamped crooked, it would damage the press. The machine was designed to stamp from sheets, not single parts at a time. It explicitly stated this in the manual, the previous engineers explained it to me and it was part of the new operator<sq>s training. I *tried* explaining why it was a bad idea, but they were convinced that since the sheet of raw material wasn<sq>t *that* thick, that a minor shift in the head would still allow it to say within tolerances.<br><br>They didn<sq>t listen. I got blown off and insulted. A few minutes later when the production workers went on break, the two engineers started going through the scrap bin to find a piece big enough to make *one* part. I started arguing with them, they blew me off and went on with what they were doing.<br><br>I basically started running across the shop floor to get to the Maintenance Manager<sq>s office. Basically just as I crossed the threshold of his door and started saying <dq>The engineers...<dq> we heard a <dq>CRA-CRACK!<dq> and it sounded like someone fired a cannon on the shop floor. My boss basically jumped up and said <dq>What was THAT?<dq> (with more swearing). I explained to him that it was our main press.<br><br>We hurried our way over to it and found the two engineers with the press in manual mode, trying to lift the press head back up and it just wasn<sq>t happening. There was hydraulic oil basically streaming out of the machine. My boss ran over, slammed the E-stop and then the fireworks started. Lots of cussing and they were real close to getting into a physical altercation.<br><br>They had tried running one part. The press head came down, the pressure built up, the press head shifted out of tolerance and two of the four main hydraulic cylinders catastrophically failed. These weren<sq>t small cylinders, they weren<sq>t the biggest I<sq>ve ever worked with, but they were substantial. The push rod of one cylinder broke, which was amazing to me, because the push rods were quite thick. *That<sq>s a lot of force*. The second one failed when the barrel of the cylinder split because the push rod shifted. That<sq>s where all the hydraulic oil was coming from.<br><br>What made everything worse was that these hydraulic cylinders were proprietary equipment. We couldn<sq>t get the cylinders from any distributor other than the manufacturer. They were custom to this press and were designed by the engineers that created this press.<br><br>My boss went up to the management offices to verbally berate everyone he could and in the mean time I started making phone calls to the press manufacturer. I figured out they weren<sq>t something I could buy off a shelf, so I called the manufacturer. The first person at customer support asked <dq>What company are you with?<dq> and I told them. I was *immediately* transferred to the finance department and was basically told that we hadn<sq>t made a payment on the press in over 8 months. We had no credit with them and we weren<sq>t getting any parts, regardless of how big or small.<br><br>When I told my boss this, he stormed back up into the President<sq>s office, probably said some pretty interesting things, came back down, apologized to me, packed his stuff and left.<br><br>At this point, I was eating lunch because there really was nothing else I could do. I spread out things to soak up the oil, but without parts or knowledge of when we were going to get parts, I was basically dead in the water. I was sitting at the Maintenance Manager<sq>s desk taking everything in and eating my peanut butter and jelly sandwich when the President poked his head in the office and said <dq>Hey, you, you<sq>re the Maintenance Manager now.<dq> He didn<sq>t even refer to me by *name*, mostly because I don<sq>t think he knew it. No pay raise, no increase in benefits, just a shiny new title that I really didn<sq>t give a shit about. Oh! and business cards. yaaaay.<br><br>Production basically ground to a halt. We had quickly used up all of our back-stock. I have no clue what voodoo magic the shady president of the company worked, but we ended up getting two new cylinders about a week and a half later. Rumor was that he had a close friend put them on his credit card. I installed them. By this time we had no stock in house. Everything we were making basically went out the door to General Motors. We were supposed to have enough stock to last 6 weeks according to our contract and the GM reps were *really* unhappy that we didn<sq>t.<br><br>The company never made up ground after that. GM ended up sending in their own engineers who basically blew off the new green engineers at our plant. The green engineers at our plant tried to give the GM engineers the same attitude they gave the maintenance staff and that just went over like a box full of dead puppies. The GM engineers basically started ignoring them and coming directly to me to discuss things. It was like having my company<sq>s original engineers back. Even though the situation was shit, I really enjoyed working with the GM engineers and I<sq>d like to think they enjoyed working with me.<br><br>The GM engineers eventually stopped showing up. I think that was the death toll for the company. The company kept trying to save itself, but the decisions they were making to save itself were *horribly* unsafe and extremely stupid. They were taking risks with people<sq>s lives and well being. One of the women working production eventually lost an arm in a press while I was working. <br><br>A very short time after that I quit. I eventually ended up in an active OSHA investigation because of that company and the only thing that really saved me was my documentation, which the original engineers taught me to do to protect my own ass. The company tried to blame me for the woman losing her arm. *Shady assholes.*<br><br>The company eventually shut it<sq>s doors within a few months of me leaving. Not because of me leaving, I am not that big-headed, but because of the decisions and changes in operations they made in the last year. It was really a sad thing to watch go down. <br><br></p>",

Brunel<sq>s broad gauge, which is what the Great Western railway used (a smidgeon over 6ft). Brunel reckoned it<sq>d be a smoother ride and allow greater speed, just for the reasons you guessed. However, for various reasons, in an early industrial rerun of betamax vs VHS, the standard gauge won through and the Great Western had to convert their lines.

Over time, the muscles which would be utilized when not wearing a bra either do not develop or atrophy from lack of use. So when a bra is removed those muscles/tendons are stressed and thus fatigued more quickly. I think if you want a good answer you would need to compare osteo-spinal issues with groups which do not have cultural norms of wearing bras likely in Southeast Asia and Africa with Western groups. My guess is that the literature does not exist to support easy data mining for that.

I don<sq>t have any experience with building or designing concrete structures (I<sq>m an ME)but I<sq>ve been interested in this same thing since I live in Atlanta. <br><br>From what I<sq>ve read so far concrete structures like these, called prestressed members (they could be postsressed members I<sq>m not sure but it doesn<sq>t make much difference), have steel cables embedded in them to increase the overall strength of the structure. Concrete is great in compression but useless in tension so to make up for this steel cables can be used to roughly speaking squeeze the ends of the structure to keep the concrete in compression. So when you hold a flame to the bottom of a concrete structure like this a lot of bad things start happening all at the same time<colon><br><br>* Thermal Expansion - Both the concrete and the steel are expanding but the steel expands more quickly. As the steel elongates it begins to compress the ends of the concrete structure less and less, eventually causing the bottom face of the concrete structure to go back into tension. Concrete in tension = no more bridge. At the same time the steel is also expanding in diameter and inducing additional stresses in the concrete leading to cracks.<br><br>* Explosive Spalling - Basically chunks of concrete start being popped off the structure as the water molecules jiggle their way to freedom. The newly liberate chunks of concrete can either expose more concrete or if it goes deep enough the steel reinforcement underneath. Not sure how much this played a factor in the overall failure but it certainly didn<sq>t help.<br><br>* Changing Mechanical properties - As the temperature goes up the mechanical properties of the steel and the concrete go down. It looks like between 400-600 C is when things start to go downhill fast for both materials. The concrete basically starts to break down and just crumble.<br><br>Again I<sq>m not an expert on this stuff so I<sq>m sure someone else can correct anything I might have misstated. <br><br>Ultimately I think the steel cables stopped being able to carry the tensile load, the concrete on the bottom face slowly went from compression to tension, and the bridge came down.</p>",

After a pretty short distance the round would begin tumbling and lose accuracy.  They found that they could stabilize the round by spinning it.  To spin it, they developed the concept of rifling.  Today<sq>s modern tanks use smooth bore barrels because the rounds deploy stabilizing fins when they exit the barrel, or are <sq>sabot rounds<sq>.  A sabot round has an smaller aerodynamically shaped projectile inside of a casing that fits tightly into the barrel.  When the Sabot round leaves the barrel, the outer casing is shed, revealing the aerodynamically stable sabot round.  This isn<sq>t a practical approach in the case of small arms, so rifling is still used.<br><br>Because rail guns are so large and high powered, similar to artillery or tank weapons in size, the rail guns that I have seen have all been sabot based.

The result is a single file that serves as my master document for the machine, and this is what I use to keep all of our machine shops up to date.  When a change happens, I make my changes in CAD, then export a new PDF of the drawing(s) that affected.  Then I copy the files to the relevant drawing set(s), and update their changelogs.  <br><br>I have roughly 10 machines that I handle in this way.

This got a LOT more challenging when you are managing highly educated, experienced people - plus I had to learn business finance on the fly. And I was doing it all in my second language.

Engineers are inherently bad at this because we take listening to be <dq>did I parse the words coming out of your mouth?<dq> What it REALLY is, is making the other person feel like <dq>man he really understands me.<dq> Listening is a very active skill, and I eventually wound up rearranging my whole office to give the person or people addressing me a stage where they are my sole focus. <br><br>The number two skill you need to learn to lead with questions. As an engineer, someone asks a question, you provide the answer, end of. As a manager you need to lead them to the answer. Yes, there are times you just come out with because time is urgent or the matter is too small to bother with (or sometimes just answering the question is the right thing to do). But if you are trying to persuade a group of people to accomplish a goal, which is your job description as a manager, then you need to leave your expertise-based certainty of the correct answer to the side and get your team pursuing it on their steam, not yours. Your job isn<sq>t to be the smartest, most motivated guy in the room (which you might well be). Your job is to get everyone else at their smartest and most motivated. And that<sq>s not a matter of rah-rah or prizes, though they can help. It<sq>s a game of persuasion. <br><br>If you get these two things, those are the biggest soft skills you need. </p>",

I don<sq>t believe that the angle of repose is affected from being supported by two walls within the annulus. Those two walls merely intersect the cone. They don<sq>t affect the stacking properties of the gravel. (as long as the diameter of the gravel << the space between the walls. i.e. No mechanical bridging or wedging can occur.)<br><br>Imagine that you had two infinite sheets of plexiglass with a five-inch space between them. If you start dumping gravel in at a single point far above, you will end up with a 2-D slice of the conical pile. Its left and right edges, unencumbered by plexiglass, will continue to collapse and spread at the same critical angle as the conical pile. There is no amount of gravel you can dump in that will cause the outer edge to suddenly defy physics and pile vertically. <br><br>Now take this infinite sheet, and roll it into an annulus. It becomes clear that it is physically impossible to fill one side of it without filling the other. The maximum difference in height between the two sides is solely a function of annulus circumference and the material<sq>s angle of repose. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>ve been in the field of mechanical engineering for a little over five and a half years. I graduated with a bachelors in ME with a concentration in aerospace, and then went to go work in industry. While working, I got my master<sq>s in mechanical with a focus on solid mechanics.<br><br>At my first job (which I was with for five years), I started off using my brain and consequently, applying my coursework fairly often. I was performing hand calculations, learning finite element analysis, and making new designs for parts for a system that<sq>d never been built before. It was a great experience. A year in, I started getting pulled more into the construction support side of things; which was also a good experience. I got to learn how to troubleshoot issues with manufacturing, and how to solve problems; but in general I wasn<sq>t really applying my engineering background as much as my general problem solving ability.<br><br>Fast forward to about 3-3.5 years in to my last job. I<sq>m quickly becoming a local expert in finite element analysis. I<sq>m finishing my grad school degree and I<sq>ve established a name for myself at the company. People come to me for help pretty often, and I<sq>m working on some cool problems. I<sq>m working a lot of hours again, and I<sq>m doing a lot of math. A lot of hand calcs supplementing a lot of finite element analysis. A lot of the time, I would have to program solutions to problems that we don<sq>t typically solve, because of the scale and the rate at which I was trying to do work. I came up with a lot of clever solutions to a lot of problems, and had the ability to provide insight to new designs for new hardware. <br><br>This period was supplemented with some <dq>BS<dq> work, but most of it was easy and enjoyable; for example I hosted a monthly finite element analysis user meeting at my company. I would spend a day or two developing slides for a concept in finite element analysis, and make some models to demonstrate a principle or two and its application, and then present to 20-35 people and have an open ended discussion about how to do our jobs efficiently.<br><br>I also got pulled in to explore new software for performing analysis. While it<sq>s not really applying any engineering principles, I did have to think about the business from both a cost sense and an experience sense, thinking about how much experience with checking calculations people would have; what the learning curve effect would do to our budgets, etc.<br><br>Fast forward another 6 months or a year. Upper management has finally realized I<sq>m competent. This is a bad thing. I get pulled into meetings about business and design process, with high managerial oversight and direct interface with boss<sq>s boss<sq>s boss level of leadership. They like me a lot because I talk during meetings and contribute good ideas. Sometimes my ideas are stupid, but sometimes pointing out stupid obvious ideas is a good thing to do to make you rethink stuff.<br><br>So I<sq>m making flow charts and requirements documents. I<sq>ve had to make requirements docs before; they<sq>re boring but necessary. I<sq>m fine with doing some <dq>BS<dq> work where I<sq>m not doing a calculation because I know I<sq>m supporting a system that will need analysis, and the work has to get done regardless. I get a system<sq>s engineer under me, and eventually I<sq>m getting programmers to work with me. I have to coordinate meetings with people in different disciplines that have their own problems and want **nothing** to do with process stuff. I don<sq>t want anything to do with it, and I<sq>m not using my brain for the better part of 6mo-1year. I<sq>m still hosting FEA conferences, but I<sq>m not doing any math. I bring it up to my boss, his boss, and his boss, and they all told me to go pound sand and that we basically <dq>didn<sq>t have anyone else<dq>. I<sq>m not a systems/process engineer. If I wanted to be a systems/process engineer, I<sq>d go tell my boss <dq>I want to do systems and process engineering<dq>. I<sq>m a math guy.<br><br>So I quit.<br><br>My new job threw me into the pit right away. Yeah, there<sq>s always going to be some BS work; but in my first month I<sq>ve had to do a bunch of mini hand-calcs, I<sq>m being brought up to speed with doing FEA to support projects, and it already feels like I<sq>m going to be doing math again pretty consistently. I<sq>ve been learning a ton, and it<sq>s fun to try to keep up. I<sq>m doing a bunch of work that<sq>s within my capability but just outside of what I<sq>ve done before, so it<sq>s a good feeling to have to learn new things and still apply old principles to them. It feels like people already listen to what I have to say, and I know I might be partially blinded by a <dq>new job mentality<dq>, but I<sq>m certainly happier right now than I was a couple months ago.<br><br>So that<sq>s my story. I hope it helps. I love doing calculations. It helps to get hobbies that let you express yourself through doing calculations outside of work during times that your work may not be exciting. Just because work isn<sq>t exciting doesn<sq>t mean you<sq>re above it. All work needs to get done, but to a certain extent, you have to parse the work you like to do against the work you don<sq>t like to do, and talk with your supervision about the balance between them. For my first 3-4 years at my last job, they were pretty receptive to it and I was pretty happy with the work; and I liked the people. My last year they stopped listening and I was becoming miserable; not feeling like I was accomplishing anything on a day to day basis--so I left.<br><br>C<sq>est la vie, right?</p>",

Closed loop controllers are primarily for maintaining a constant position when there are disturbances which need to be rejected. Open-loop controllers work okay if your system model is sufficient and there are low or no disturbances. <br><br>Second, what sort of disturbances are there with extrusion 3D printing? Well, pretty much none. There are very few forces which are acting on the print head, especially in the X and Y planes. That means that closed-loop control isn<sq>t absolutely necessary, but the open-loop controller needs to be well tuned.<br><br>Third, can the end user tolerate tuning the open-loop controller? This is the big diversion from home users and industrial users. Even though there are small, nearly negligible disturbances, things still go wrong. <br><br>To home users, a failed print just means print it again, or re-calibrate. They<sq>re not measuring downtime, and downtime has no real-world cost. It<sq>s tolerable.<br><br>For industrial users who are measuring downtime, a failed print is lost money. By adding closed loop control, you significantly reduce the likely hood of failed prints and downtime caused by calibration issues. <br><br>It<sq>s worth nothing that industrial CNC machines use motors with encoders in them, because the disturbances they see when machine bits are working on a part are significant.

My experiences are based in research so I apologise if my answer is slightly skewed.<br><br>One of the most powerful applications of Fourier Series is vibration testing. Using the Fast-Fourier Transform (usually shortened to FFT) you can approximate the time-domain signal which you get from your sensor (accelerometer, strain gauge, etc.) as a sum of sine waves of varying frequencies. This allows you to examine the frequency response of your structure from which you can identify the natural frequencies (eigenvalues) which is extremely important as you obviously want to avoid your structure resonating as this can lead to failure.<br><br>Basically the Fourier series and the discrete Fourier transform (and the FFT) allow us to transform a signal into the frequency domain, which is generally much easier to understand/interpret and many useful insights can be made which are not necessarily possible (or easy to do) in the time domain.</p>",

We have had a lot of quality problems with almost every driver supplier we have worked with. The issue, IMO is that companies are still very focused on driving new models to keep up with the race and not resolving quality issues in the current production drivers. The drivers are pretty complex circuits and can face any number of issues any other PCB design can face. There are a few driver manufacturers that have started offering 50k hour + warranties. We have started requiring reliability testing on any drivers we use to reduce field returns. <br><br>Edit<colon> Agreeing with u/402C5 on heat dissipation as a reason for early failures.

Within these ranges, towers tend to be the most cost effective (considering the steel plus the land they sit on) for the height (assuming 4-5 different carrier levels, with fair soils, in a populated area).<br><br>From a site space perspective, monopoles can have the smallest footprint (drilled shaft), followed by self support towers, which have a larger base, followed by guyed towers which require a lot more room and separate foundations for each cluster of guy wires. Monopoles will have a large base moment at the foundation, so if you have soils that will not perform well to resist the lateral loads of a drilled shaft or bearing of a mat foundation, you will often see small self support towers instead. This is the case since each individual leg will either only see uplift or compression and the skin friction on a drilled shaft can be used to resist those forces. The other extreme is when you see very small guyed towers. These are more typical for very light loads (maybe 1 level, or just radio equipment) in remote areas where space is not at a premium.<br><br>Again, there are so many factors that are site-specific and these are far from set rules.

Sprinkle rouge on one, take another, and rub the two for a good long time until the two have ground each other down such that the rouge appears fairly evenly distributed. Be sure to rub them in different directions, to distribute the rubbing evenly. <br><br>Now, take stones 1 and 3 and do the same thing. You<sq>ll notice the rouge rubbing off in certain spots which correspond with the high spots on stone 3, but over time, they<sq>ll get knocked down. Then, take stones 2 and 3 and do the same thing. Then go back to 1 and 2, and just keep rotating between stones. Eventually, you<sq>ll see that the rouge is very evenly distributed across all three stones, and they<sq>ve become astonishingly flat and perhaps even taken on a polish. Done properly (this is just the 2 second explanation; search the web for a more in-depth explanation) they<sq>ll be flat to within about .0001<dq>. For comparison, a sheet of paper (such that you put in a xerox machine) is about .004<dq> thick. <br><br>Once you have a flat reference surface, you can make tools that are very precise for making other things.

That sounds in contradiction to saying that they didn<sq>t roll much in heavy seas, but it stems from the same basis<colon> as the hull rolls or the seas cant around it, the submerged volume does not change much, so there is little increased floatation on the side which is more submerged. In contrast as something shaped like an aircraft carrier heels over, the submerged volume on the <dq>down<dq> side is greatly increased, which tends to right the ship.<br><br>The Russians lost three battleships  of tumblehome design (out of four) at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. Apart from stability problems while turning, one of the biggest problems was further loss of stability when the water-tight compartments were partially flooded. This led to abandoning this design for military ships, although it is still sometimes used for civilian ships.</p>",

These are surfaces that the user will touch and hold.<br><br>One way to limit this temperature, as said elsewhere on this thread, is current limits based on temperature sensors internal to the phone. Usually at least two, one very near the battery and the other near the hottest chip (ex. Apple<sq>s A10) as well as the chips own internal temp sensors. <br><br>After current limiting it<sq>s all about conduction to the exterior surfaces where designers let the environment take over usually in the form of still air convection (again this is designer dependant). To help with conduction to these <dq>cold walls<dq> there are several methods used.  Most typically seen are graphite heat spreaders (usually black in color) as well as copper blocks and thermal pads.  Usually these TIMs (thermal interface materials) are solid and easy to manufacture but sometimes thermal grease or conductive gels are used, but these are typically a last resort method for a product like this where manufacturing inconsistencies are present and product reliability is concerned.<br><br>For PCB design, thermal design is done through the copper layers of the board. Thermal vias, copper plated small holes through the layers of a board are typically packed in close to the surface mount solder pads or balls of components high in power consumption and help sink heat away from the component through conduction. Other methods of PCB level thermal management that come to mind are board size, copper/FR4 layer thickness, and one that typically goes to the wayside on PCBs this small is copper layout and routing to prevent a break in the thermal path.<br><br>If you are looking for PCB thermal management tips there are a lot of resources out there from IC suppliers.

Because really, the radius of gyration  (if you had a thin cylinder with the same rotational inertia as the actual wheel, what its diameter would be) of a real wheel is less than the overall wheel diameter, the real effect is less.<br><br>So, if we say the effect is that wheel weight savings <sq>counts as<sq> 1.75x of non-rotary weight savings, your 40lb weight savings will have the same straight-line effect as saving 70lbs or about 2<percent>.<br><br></p>",

This has nothing to do with sprung vs unsprung, its just about the fact that wheels need to both store rotational energy and be accelerated longitudinally.<br><br>So if your ~4000 lb car (curb weight with driver) looses 40 lbs from the wheels, you can expect 2<percent> faster acceleration.

This is due ENTIRELY to the change in unsprung mass, and is not much affected by MOI.  If your wheels weigh 33<percent> less, they get accelerated 50<percent> faster by the suspension, so track the ground better.  How much difference that will make is hard to quantify.

                "answer": "<p>On a power grid malfunction, all US power reactors will end up scramming (emergency shutdown, rapid insertion of all control rods). The cause varies from plant to plant. Some plants the Reactor Protection System (RPS) uses power from the grid to hold the control rods out. On a loss of offsite power, the RPS deenergizes and the control rod grippers let go (or scram pilot solenoids deenergize) resulting in the SCRAM. Within about 3 seconds of this happening, the reactor is fully shut down.<br><br>On a loss of power grid, the majority of reactors will scram on a load reject. The main generator cannot go from full output to house loads only without potential damage in most plants, so on a loss of grid, the generator will lockout, which causes a turbine trip, which will generate a reactor scram signal. <br><br>Ultimately, all reactors will end up offline. Decay heat now becomes an issue. With no offsite power, emergency generators will eventually start up automatically or manually. Generally on a LOOP they will automatically start, but some plants emergency generators will only start when a safety-injection signal comes in (with no human interaction it eventually will). <br><br>For PWR plants, decay heat is removed by the steam generators venting to atmosphere, and steam generator makeup is through the auxiliary feed system. Operators will cooldown and depressurize the reactor to cold shut down by venting steam from the steam generators, removing more and more heat from the reactor. Once the reactor is cooled down enough, the residual heat removal system will be activated and use heat exchangers to cool the reactor directly to the ultimate heat sink.<br><br>For BWR plants, makeup will initially be with the high pressure core spray (or coolant injection) system, the reactor core isolation cooling system, or the isolation condenser will be used for heat removal (depending on design and fitted equipment). Decay heat is removed by the relief valves to the suppression pool. The suppression pool is a 1 million gallon supply of water which acts as an emergency cooling water source, and also a temporary heat sink. The suppression pool is cooled using the residual heat removal system in the suppression pool cooling mode. Operators will depressurize the reactor by slowly venting steam to the suppression pool, until pressure is low enough to put the residual heat removal system in service directly on the reactor itself. <br><br>All of this is accomplished using the emergency generators and safety systems only. The spent fuel pool cooling system at most plants is also powered by the emergency generators, for other plants, there are either cross-ties with the residual heat removal system for emergency pool cooling, the ability to do emergency makeup with the emergency service water system, the ability to make up with fire pumps, or the ability to cross-tie the spent fuel pool cooling pumps to the emergency generators once the reactor has been cooled down and the ECCS systems are no longer necessary.<br><br>In the event that no diesel fuel is re-supplied, eventually your cooling systems stop, and you are reliant on portable pumps powered by fuel oil (whether its gasoline, diesel, etc). Every plant has at least 7 days of fuel supply on site for each generator. With no fuel, and the emergency generators shut down, the core will heat up, pressurize, lose coolant through the safety valves lifting on overpressure, core uncovery will occur, then you have a slower version of a traditional core melt sequence. Depending on how long since the shutdown, the amount of containment leakage will be much smaller, but you will likely have radioactive release due to the short amount of time since shutdown.<br><br>As for the spent fuel pool, BWR spent fuel rods are capable of air cooling in an extreme emergency after 4 months out of the reactor, and PWR spent fuel rods after 11 months. If the pool boils off and hasn<sq>t had sufficient decay time, the fuel rods may heat up enough to cause an auto-catalyzing metal-water reaction with the fuel cladding, causing large amounts of heat and potentially creating a zirconium fire, causing an large release of radioactive material. Of course, a fire pump spray can completely prevent this. About 150 gpm of spray will keep the fuel safe even if it cannot be kept covered for BWR fuel (not sure on the numbers for PWR fuel).<br><br>If the power grid goes out, as it did in the 2003 blackout, as it happened at Turkey point during hurricane andrew and at Browns Ferry in 2011 due to tornados, the government prioritizes the safety of nuclear units. The department of homeland security has air lifted emergency generator components to reactor sites and even landed on the highway to get the components to plants as necessary. At Browns ferry they brought in emergency generator components when one unit was down to only 1 power source remaining. <br><br>Another thing to keep in mind<colon> SAFER/FLEX (the post fukushima plan). There are 2 locations in the US which each have 6 full sets of emergency cooling systems, emergency generators, and supplies for them. They can be delivered or air lifted to any nuclear plant in the us within 24 hours. So for realistic scenarios where portions of the grid drop, and there is a failure of emergency generators, a plant can maintain adequate core cooling for at least 24 hours until the SAFER equipment can be brought on site to implement FLEX and achieve core cooling with just portable equipment.<br><br>If you have any questions please let me know.</p>",

Break the large project into smaller tasks. Create a schedule, that is complete bs, and try to get tasks done on time.

When I can<sq>t get a straight answer what needs to be done and I have a schedule to meet, I already know whatever the engineer gets done will be incorrect someway anf will need to be reworked.

Be positive and treat the team with respect.  Listen to them and take their opinion into account.  If they say something is going to take 3 weeks and not to pad the schedule; believe that it takes 3 weeks, don<sq>t be telling them to get it done in a week.  That just demotivates them and next time, the schedule will be padded.<br><br>2. Break down tasks, figure out how to make the tasks smaller and easier to manage.  If it truly is a large task understand how many people will be needed, try to see how multiple people can work on it.  Remember that often adding 2 people to a task doesn<sq>t mean it takes \u00bd as long, but closer to \u00beths as long.  More is not always better but often good for ideas and grinding through tasks.<br><br>3. Playing the blame game.  Something goes wrong and the schedule is missed by a few days.  Now you go about finding out what went wrong and then put the blame on their shoulders.  Shit happens, schedules get missed, life plays a part, etc.  My previous project manager did this and the team was always angry and frustrated and thus unmotivated to continue.  One day I decided that whenever something went wrong, I would step up and take the blame, no matter what it was.  A month later the team is working much better with one another, they are no longer feeling like beaten dogs, and are making good progress.  I told them, no matter what, blame me, it<sq>s my fault.  I took a lot of heat for a few months, but now everyone is working harder and there is little blame to take.  Sometimes just getting through the problems needs to be done, once blame was removed, people were willing to figure out solutions to the problems and move ahead. </p>",

This includes landing features.  The only real thing a pilot has to do is take the plane off.  After that autopilot can be engaged and the job requires entering speed, heading and altitudes via dials on the control panels.  Landing is pretty similar.  You bring the plane into a descent pattern either manually or by auto pilot.  The computer will have your final airport location stored in its system.  The computer can then control the descent.  When you enter class A airspace (very close to the airport I forget the actual distance) all the planes are actually talking to each other.  This helps the computers know more about their surroundings.

Bar none this technique will yield the cleanest clothes.<br><br>Next came top loaders, which operate on the principle of creating a soapy bath with an agitator in the center to move that water.

                "answer": "<p>Biplanes existed for several reasons<colon><br><br>* **Early aircraft did not have efficient airfoils.** They needed the extra wing area to produce enough lift at a slow enough speed to enable heavier-than air flight. Part of what made the Wright Brothers successful was their use the most accurate data for airfoils at the time. The biggest part was still the development of the internal combustion engine.<br><br>* **Aircraft wing structures would not support the weight of the aircraft without complicated truss structures.** Bracing cables were used to stiffen and strengthen the wing structure by literally tying the two or three wings together which exploited the extra bending stiffness of two offset wings. (I can elaborate on this if necessary)<br><br>* **Monoplanes could not compete with biplanes in this regard.** A single wing using the aerodynamic and structural designs used in biplanes could not lift its own weight and even if it could, the structure would fail. You do, however see some <sq>missing links<sq> if you will wherein early monoplanes were still using bracing struts and wires. Some monoplanes still rely on braced wing structures to reduce wing structural weight (see most Piston-engined Cessnas) but they do some much more efficiently than early monoplanes and biplanes.<br><br>Biplanes and Triplanes have all but disappeared for several related reasons<colon><br><br>* **One of NACA<sq>s (The precursor to NASA) first tasks was to kill the biplane.** Specifically they put a lot of effort into designing airfoils and airfoil standardization (NACA-series airfoils) that created not only more-efficient lifting surfaces, but also adequate thickness for internal structure as opposed to bracing wires. Now you didn<sq>t need to brace a wing with another wing. You could fit enough structure inside the wing instead.<br><br>* **Why bother getting rid of the bracing?** It<sq>s extremely draggy. A single cable in a wind flow has as much drag as a small streamlined wing. Now look at a biplane and count all the bracing wires and fiddly bits hanging out in the wind causing drag. More drag = more fuel burn to get to the same speed as well as a lower top speed. It<sq>s also annoying to maintain but so are a lot of things we deal with.<br><br>* **So why not still use un-braced biplanes?** The problem here is that two wings near each other interfere with each other. From a design standpoint if you need twice the lift it may seem like an easy solution to simply change to a biplane and expect twice the lift of a monoplane but in practice fluid mechanics doesn<sq>t allow it. The influence of one wing on the other reduces the lift on the other and vice versa. If you do things well you<sq>ll be lucky to get 150<percent> the lift of a monoplane. But at the same time you<sq>re guaranteed to get at least 200<percent> the wing drag of a monoplane. **So while you can increase your lift, your Lift-to-Drag ratio actually decreases** and that drives your range, endurance, and other performance metrics. Biplane performance is comparatively crap. It should be no surprise then that high-performance aircraft like we saw in WWII are all monoplanes.<br><br>* **A reason often overlooked is pilot visibility.** High-wing aircraft often have a prominent blind spot -- they cant easily see things above them. Low-wing aircraft have a similar problem -- pilots often can<sq>t see things below them. The wings are in the way! Now imagine you<sq>re flying an airplane that has both these problems. Staggering the wings (moving one forward and one backward) attempts to alleviate this to some degree but stagger is usually done for aerodynamic reasons that are clear from basic trigonometry. The further away a biplane<sq>s wings are from each other, they more they act like monoplane wings (i.e. more efficient). Having them on top of each other is worse off then the same height but spread apart horizontally too.<br><br>Why do biplanes still exist at all?<br><br>* **They<sq>re a wonderful part of aviation history** and there<sq>s a certain amount of nostalgia associated with WWI and interwar aviation that was arguably dominated by biplanes.<br><br>* **They do have less <sq>roll damping<sq> which is the engineering way of saying they can roll really fast** without a lot of effort. Airplanes with longer wingspans have to drag more wing area and a longer moment arm through the air and it<sq>s thus harder to roll. So biplanes are often attractive for aerobatics because they have a lot of control power (four ailerons as opposed to two for instance) and less resistance to those controls.</p>",

While the balls are not magnetized, they are magnetic or the stirrer couldn<sq>t spin them.<br><br>As the balls spin, the outer balls are rolling on the surface of the plate.  This gives them rotational kinetic energy and momentum.  The stirrer wants the ball to move in a circular path, but this rotational momentum wants to move the ball in a straight line.  The result is that the ball shifts out so that it<sq>s direction of rotation is a little off from the path to the center of the stirrer.  This leaves the edge that<sq>s toughing the middle ball with a little bit of <dq>upward<dq> motion.  <br><br>Normally the back of a tire is moving up while the front is going down.

So, just to throw some numbers in there, let<sq>s say he<sq>s pointing at 57 degrees rotation (measured from the longitudinal axis of his aircraft), and at 37 degrees from the horizontal (of his aircraft). Since the enemy plane is flying at a higher altitude, the gunner has to keep inclining his gun to 38 degrees, 39 degrees, etc. as the plane flies closer and above him.<br><br>At some point, his inclination will be 90 degrees (pointing straight up), and his rotation will be facing the direction the enemy plane used to be coming from. As the enemy plane passes overhead, the gunner will have to incline his gun to 90 degrees, and rotate 180 degrees *instantly* to follow the enemy plane perfectly, and then follow the enemy plane from 90 degrees, to 89 degrees, 88, 87, etc.<br><br>The gunner obviously cannot rotate 180 instantly, and he can only incline his gun 90 degrees maximum, so when the enemy plane is directly <dq>above<dq> his plane, he is <dq>gimble locked<dq>, because he cannot perfectly follow the enemy plane with his sights as it flies overhead.<br><br>The problem is that, while the gunner can point his gun in any direction, under a few, specific conditions, he cannot perfectly track an enemy plane between two points.<br><br>Or if you think of it as a continuous state space, he can access all possible states (eg<colon> every single rotation/inclination pair), but he can<sq>t transition between two specific states under certain conditions (eg<colon> 90 degrees inclination facing <dq>forward<dq>, to 90 degrees facing <dq>backward<dq>).<br><br>So that<sq>s a real-world example of mechanical gimble lock.<br><br>There are a few ways to design the gunner<sq>s nest to alleviate that gimble lock<colon> the inclination mechanism can be designed to allow the gun to go beyond the vertical, 90 degree limit, although that<sq>s kind of weird for the gunner, or add a <dq>degree of freedom<dq> and let the gun rotate left and right independently of the gunner<sq>s turret (which would still also rotate). That way, a suitably trained and talented gunner can rotate his nest and his gun in tandem to perfectly track the enemy plane.</p>",

The mechanism itself doesn<sq>t actually <dq>lock up<dq>.  It doesn<sq>t break down, it doesn<sq>t catch or snag.  What happens is that, when two of the axes of a three-axis gimbal line up, you effectively only have a two-axis system.  If you have some system that can handle all three axes at once, then you can still get to any position you want, you just end up taking a non-ideal path.  <br><br>Imagine this difficulty to a pilot.  They try to just tilt the nose downwards, and instead the plane banks and rolls.  In an atmosphere-free situation, you<sq>d still end up with the correct orientation.  However, in real life, the banking and rolling and yawing of the vehicle will have changed its position, speed, stability, etc.  <br><br>Similarly, there are applications in robotics.  If a robot is trying to adjust slightly to get to a different position when gimbal locked (called a <dq>singularity<dq>) it may calculate huge movements like 180-degree turns to move that small amount, as it has lost a degree of freedom due to certain axes aligning.  <br><br>BScatterplot posted a video about gimbal lock in animation, shown in a way that ignores all the matricies.

Aren<sq>t you aligning your capital justification with a program?  <dq>   <dq>No, that<sq>s not my job; my job is to run the machine and make measurements.<dq>   <br><br>Well actually in *that* organization, it really *was* his job (if he wanted nice shiny equipment).  But since he didn<sq>t play the game properly he was going to be a bitter engineer of eternal Epic Fail.  <br><br>Why did I know this?  **Because I had all the nicest, newest equipment.**  We had $M test equipment routinely rolling into our lab across the hall each quarter.  We replaced Mentor Graphics CAD stations and the workstation hardware every year at $250K a pop with the latest and greatest.  We had travel budget to do anything we wanted.  I was <dq>the national expert for nonvolatile memory technology and applications for DOD<dq>.<br><br>How did we achieve this <dq>magic<dq>?  We (as a department) aligned with our program offices and made them deals they couldn<sq>t (*and didn<sq>t want to*) refuse which included massive capital budget support from them.  They did this because we engaged them politically and technically to solve problems that mattered to them and to the organization so it is <dq>obvious<dq> we should have our equipment needs met *and our technical ideas should be embraced*.  This was our department strategy and we played the strategy as a team.<br><br>Why did the equipment matter?  Because it allowed us to execute well and fast when the program offices needed answers.  We also were more financially creative than most other groups<colon> we created a <dq>retainer funding<dq> system that put us on call to our program offices, first in line, in exchange for a steady overhead funding level.  We could execute well and had a track record of that so our ideas were embraced.<br><br>BTW most of us had only BSEE and MSEE degrees.<br><br>As we also say routinely in /r/entrepreneur, ideas are a dime a dozen; nearly worthless individually - all that matters is execution.   A middling idea well executed is ALWAYS better than a great idea poorly executed.

After that it<sq>s about what you *actually do*.  How you execute on things.  Degrees are ONLY indicators of ability but not proof of ability.

I left my think tank partly because there was an element of non-innovation beyond my own department.  Also the primary charge numbers we were using were from programs that were in the process of being de-funded by Congress so it was obvious hard times were imminent.

                "answer": "<p>Some good info here already. But when you say <dq>tipping over<dq> that is what we refer to as the lateral design. Buildings are built for the gravity loads and for lateral loads (downward and sideways). Lateral loads are wind and seismic on the above ground portion of the building, soil, and occasionally water pressures below. The lateral system is designed separately from the gravity system. Within the building it can be composed of braced frames, moment frames, and/or shear walls to name a few common systems. The lateral system controls the sway of the building and transfers the load into the ground. Once you are at the ground you have two types of lateral loads - shear and overturning moment. The shear wants to push the building sideways and the moment wants to tip it over. You can counter the shear with soil friction and/or soil pressure. The moment can be countered with mass and/or with soil friction. There are many types of foundations, as stated already, including deep foundations (caissons, piles, etc) and shallow (matt, spread, etc). The type of foundation used is determined by the combination of soil quality, economy, local preferences, building loads, etc. A geotechnical engineer will analyze the local soil and/or bedrock and provide capacity, friction coefficients, drag, and other soil parameters to aid the stuctural engineer in the design. That<sq>s the short answer.</p>",

It has [this graph](https<colon>//www.cartech.com/uploadedImages/Tech_Center/Technical_Articles/ta54agehardsuperalloys05aprfig1.gif) which shows that there are some materials that don<sq>t lose a lot of strength up to 1200\u00b0F.<br><br>1000\u00b0F is about 810 K which isn<sq>t actually [that deep](http<colon>//www.lpi.usra.edu/exploration/training/illustrations/planetaryInteriors/preview/03.png) in the ground. That graph looks like it might only be 100 km down.<br><br>From [this graph](https<colon>//www.researchgate.net/profile/Lajos_Volgyesi/publication/228377528/figure/fig12/AS<colon>302084151889936@1449033882831/Fig-12-The-pressure-at-different-depths-in-the-Earth<sq>s-interior.png) of depth and pressure, it looks like 100 km deep would be about 0.045x10^6 bar. That<sq>s 4.5 GPa. <br><br>The highest strength material on this chart at 1200\u00b0F (looking at the right axis) is about 1.1 GPa. So the strongest hull you could build would only be 1/4 as strong as you need at the depth with no factor of safety.<br><br>If you surround the hull with a bunch of insulation so that the temperature is down to something reasonable by the pressure vessel walls (maybe layers and layers of asbestos blankets?), at room temperature titanium for example has a yield strength of about 1450 MPa or 1.45 GPa so it<sq>s still not strong enough to withstand being crushed.<br><br>Another issue is that rock is quite dense and the hot rock in the mantle is gooey. Your hull is going to constantly be floating and rising since a container of mostly air will be much lighter than the surrounding rock. You<sq>re going to have to weigh it down to make it neutrally buoyant.<br><br>Let<sq>s say there is a strong enough material to build this. You could run a heat pump to cool the interior but there isn<sq>t a cold reservoir to use to generate energy. You can<sq>t run an engine that dumps heat into the living space and then use a heat pump powered by that engine to move heat to the exterior--that<sq>d be a perpetual motion machine. So you<sq>d have to use batteries or have a connection to the surface for power. Or you could get something even hotter, like your nuclear system and use the surrounding rock as the <dq>cold<dq> side. (But then you<sq>d again have the issue of decreasing strength at higher temps and you<sq>d want to dump your heat as far away from your ship as possible, meaning pushing pipe far into the surrounding hot mantle.)<br><br>In undergrad I worked for a professor that did cryogenics. Another professor started at the lab group toward the end of my time who<sq>d been involved in designing robots for conditions like landing on Venus. The conditions at the surface there are 740 K and 9.2 MPa of pressure, or a similar temperature but about 1/500th the pressure of your situation. He said the best they can do is to slow down the melting long enough to get some useful data and typically this means only 1-1.5 hours.</p>",

You can get binder tabs for it and keep separate projects behind different tabs. First step when you get an idea is to scribble down what the idea is, and maybe draw a quick sketch. When we do this in the field, we do it in a special notebook and get it notarized by another engineer (have them look at it and sign it) for potential patent purposes, so it<sq>s not a bad habit to get into. *You* would be doing it to prevent wasting your precious materials once you actually build something. <br><br>Step 2<colon> Draw it to scale- [you can even print free graph paper and isometric graph paper too!](http<colon>//www.printfreegraphpaper.com/) Step 3<colon> Make a <dq>mock up<dq>.

Sometimes you need to make more than one set of drawings and more than one mockup. See which one you like the best. <br><br>Now you<sq>re ready to prototype. If you<sq>re building anything with any electronic parts (hint<colon> go to a thrift store or garage sale and buy broken electronics to scavenge for parts- garbage picking is great for this too!) then you want to prototype your circuits with a <dq>bread board<dq> after drawing them on paper. <br><br>I came up with basically a <dq>young electrical engineer<sq>s<dq> kit as cheaply as I could (my father is an Electrical Engineer, so I<sq>ve picked up some tips)<colon> <br>1) [free printable graph paper](http<colon>//www.printfreegraphpaper.com/) to draw out the damn circuit. Seriously, I was a TA for an intro circuits lab and you wouldn<sq>t believe how much trouble it will save you. 2) (optional) a free educational copy of AutoCAD for electrical engineers 3) [a basic bread board with jumper wires](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/microtivity-IB401-400-point-Experiment-Breadboard/dp/B004RXKWDQ/) will save you the headache of building circuits first then realizing they don<sq>t work 4) [I<sq>ve used this kit myself](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Rosewill-Professional-Computer-Components-RTK-090/dp/B004H07POS/) it<sq>s a good starter set with the little screw drivers and wire strippers necessary to scavenge old electronics, and more importantly, it has a soldering iron and *solder remover*. Trust me, when you<sq>re a solder newbie, you<sq>ll need it. 5) [A cheap-ass multimeter,](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Digital-Multimeter-Voltmeter-Ohmmeter/dp/B00B7CS3UY/) my multimeter came from Harbor Freight, to let you know what<sq>s going on with your circuitry. And 6) (optional, but highly recommended) [Helping hands](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/SE-MZ101B-Helping-Magnifying-Glass/dp/B000RB38X8/) to help hold your wires when you learn to solder. If you can<sq>t immediately find electronics to solder, I honed my skills by repairing my, and my mother<sq>s and my sister<sq>s, etc. broken jewelry and made them pretty grateful. <br><br>For your materials for building mechanical stuff, summer is DIY season. Make sure your tetanus shot is up to date, make sure your health insurance covers rabies shots, then put on long sleeves, long pants, closed toed shoes and go dumpster diving and/or garbage picking. You wouldn<sq>t believe the stuff that people throw away! Picking around in rich areas typically gets you bigger and better stuff. I furnished half of my apartment that way. Just make sure it<sq>s legal where you are. And bleach is your friend- ten parts water with one parts bleach on something will kill all bacteria and even viruses. I hope that helps <colon>) Edit<colon> If you know someone doing a remodeling project or something, ask them for their leftovers. Then you won<sq>t have to jump into the dumpster. </p>",

You won<sq>t see this a lot on more modern, large vessels, but I think it still sees wide use on recreational ships and probably smaller commercial ships.  It is still used to seal the shaft of many pumps, and the stems of all applicable valves that I am aware of.

This creates a torturous path for water to move.  We also used water that we pumped through the shaft seal to cool and keep it lubricated.  <br><br>Also, on modern large vessels, they may use redundant systems.  We had two labyrinth seals, in case one went bad and started leaking water.

In a conventional configuration, you can stand and walk around; you can literally walk into the sleeper room in the back.

Before maintenance, a driver has to be very careful to fully clean out or tie down any objects inside like tools, gadgets, anything that could fly free and move around inside, because to access the engine on a cab-over, in many designs the entire cab is lifted off the engine by tilting it forward.

We utilise boilers, coal fired heaters and gasification modules. Your guess about the match is not far off, except it<sq>s a bug ass match... Well to be honest in the boilers and gasifiers are lit using a large steel drum, filled with pulverised fuel (coal) which then gets thrown into the fire chamber. Once the coal takes fire it can sustain itself so long as you keep it fed. The main problem isn<sq>t keeping the fire going but rather keeping the fire going **where you want it**. Inside the fire chamber a heating zone exists, this is where the fuel is burned, the secret is keeping this heating zone at the correct height within the vessel. If it burns to high you will have damage to the top seals, if it burns to low you risk it going out. Ash is removed though the bottom of the vessel so the way to control the heat zone height is by either increasing or decreasing the speed at which the ash grate rotates thereby removing more or less ash in a given time. </p>",

Zero pressure differential means that nothing really wants to try that hard to leak. <br><br>Mineral oil is not the best thing to be leaking into your pool however. <br><br><br>For your rotating shafts, use well lubricates o-rings or even better, use mechanical seals. Same as they use for air conditioning compressors, it is a ceramic and a tungsten, or 2 ceramic discs that are perfectly machined flat and they provide a perfect sealing surface as long as they are exposed to water or oil. Same thing that is in basically every single industrial pump. They go several years of full time operation, 8-24 hours a day before they need service.<br><br>If you ran an umbilical cable, you could flood the electrical system to be a slight positive pressure using compressed air. Use insanely small line so it won<sq>t try to float up. Hunt around and find the plastic stuff that is around 1/8<dq> OD. <br><br>Now, it does mean a compressor and tank need to be installed, and there would ALWAYS have to be compressed air available. A dryer would also need to be installed to prevent sending down moisture. But at 10 feet, you only need several psi to keep your system dry. Something simple, slow and efficient can be made, and if you are not hitting high pressures or temperatures a lot of the compressed air problems will be a non issue. An intentional leak at the furthest point away from your intake would ensure a steady flow of dry air to keep things dry. A pressure regulator set to burp at a few psi above normal means you could pump the pressure on a set interval and do a purge cycle to clean things out in there.<br><br>You want ultimate durability?

I.e., I abstained for ~2 weeks beforehand, drank *lots* of water day of, and took a vitamin B12 pill (so pee still yellow despite drinking so much water).  After I got the all clear, I went back to my old habits.  Actually, started smoking *more* after that, as the fear of *<dq>you<sq>ll never amount to anything if you smoke so much<dq>* was taken away.  (It was a great job working on NASA projects; far exceeding parents expectations.  They could not give me shit ever again.)<br><br>I don<sq>t discuss this with my colleagues, unless I know them very well outside the office.  An anonymous tip could lead to a retest.  Probably wouldn<sq>t be fired right away, maybe a substance abuse class?  They<sq>d test more often though, and I<sq>m sure multiple violations would be career ending.  A decade in, I had a bad breakup (understatement), and crazy chick sent some <dq>anonymous<dq> letters to various agencies telling lies about me, like I showed up at work stoned every day, and had stolen data.  After a long investigation, I was cleared.  I started to abstain again as soon as I found out, but they never tested me; didn<sq>t really care about that part of it and it was obvious I wasn\u2019t high at work.  But potential data breaches get taken seriously.  In the end, the worst thing they found was by auditing my time cards for a month.  I charged 8 hours a day, but the logs of my entry/exit times averaged 7.5 hours.  *<dq>I don<sq>t use a stopwatch<dq>* I claimed.  (A lie; I did use a stopwatch, I just didn<sq>t pause it over lunch.)  *<dq>Be more careful<dq>* they said.  I was good at my job, made the whole department run smoother; they were motivated to keep me around.  After I was cleared, they investigated the chick for making false statements; no idea what came of that (probably nothing).<br><br>I have never applied for security clearance, which has limited my opportunities in the industry somewhat, and raised some eyebrows as I have to give other reasons why I don<sq>t want to.  (Politics, not wanting to bother my hippie/artist friends with background check interviews, wanting to continue talking about my cool job at parties, not wanting to work on weapons, etc.)  But really, the issue is the question about drugs.  Smoking pot is an infraction, not even a criminal offense here anymore.  But lying about it on those forms is a felony.  No thank you!  (And being honest about it on those forms is a bad idea.  One colleague told me he answered honestly about taking a hit of a joint passed around at a party a few years prior.  They made him write a fucking essay like a schoolboy, saying he wouldn<sq>t do it again.)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m curious, I was watching Friday<sq>s horrible game, and started looking at the beams.  There appear to be 4 that drop down vertically, then beams that go from those 4 that tie into the structure.  I added some construction photos which show the trusses going across the top of the roof.  My question is, <br>1. Why are they angled and not horizontal?<br>2. How do they distribute the weight of the roof?<br><br>I also found this info...  But it doesn<sq>t go into how the trusses still transfer the weight.. it would seem to me that any heavy loads on the top would push down, and because the truss is angled at the angle it is, it would seem like it would give..<br>The United Center in Chicago is now home to the Bulls basketball team and the Blackhawks hockey team. The arena features luxury suites, a column-free interior and unobstructed views. An innovative long-span roof, similar to the one topping the Anaheim Arena in California, is integral to the design and was engineered by the same firm. By using structural steel, designers and constructors created a roof that is aesthetically pleasing as well as cost-effective. The United Center features a two-way, multipost tied-arch-roof system that spans the arena seating bowl. This structural steel system produced a significant cost savings (approximately $1 million, compared to a conventional one-way truss system) and proved readily constructable. The main framing elements are six intersecting tied-arch trusses, i.e., four queen-post tied-arch trusses spanning in the short direction and two multipost tied-arch trusses spanning in the long direction. Vertical compression struts are located at eight intersection points of the tied-arch trusses. Tension tie members traverse the arena, tying the ends of the arch trusses and connecting to the bottom of the compression struts. Although the structure appears light and elegant, the effective structural depth of the system is 60 ft. This article also focuses on some of the seismic, snow and thermal loading requirements governing the designs of both the United Center and the Anaheim Arena.</p>",

I like to have around 6-8 <dq>projects<dq> going on at a time. Often I<sq>m waiting for 5-6 of those people to get back to me about something. Having a good sense of <dq>who owes me what<dq> helps me to keep them on track so that I stay on track.<br><br>* **Lots of meetings.** Huge time sink mostly. Gotta meet with <dq>shareholders<dq> (anyone whose money/time could be affected by changes, mostly other engineers, technicians, operations leaders, etc).<br><br>* **Updating procedures**. This is a big one. Managers always want procedures written so that a high-schooler could perform the operators<sq> jobs. Operators are very undervalued, I feel. The workload for procedures depends on how busy/motivated everyone is. Each procedure needs to be reviewed by a production engineer once a year. So if I<sq>m swamped with other things, I<sq>ll probably look it over for egregious errors and, not finding any, just rubber stamp it. Most of the procedures you edit will have been last edited by you anyways (one year earlier), so there<sq>s a disincentive to change anything (<dq>Why didn<sq>t you do it right the first time?<dq>). Also, not changing things only requires 2 other people to sign off on it. If you do change anything other than grammar, you<sq>re supposed to get 4-10 people to sign off on it...which often can open a huge can of worms that you don<sq>t have time for that month. If it<sq>s a slow month you can spend a lot more time fixing up old procedures that were never written correctly. Sometimes you can even fix real problems with the procedure that can help people do their work with a lower chance of injury.<br><br>* **Writing new procedures**. This is a fun one for me. Like <dq>hey we have a super rusty tank, let<sq>s get the rust out and use it for something else.<dq> OK, Use acid. Oh, but the acidizing compound needs the tank to be free of oxygen. OK, Use a nitrogen blanket. Oh, but the N2 pressure would blow out the tank. OK, use a pressure regulator. Oh, but the nitrogen has to flow through the tank for at least 11 volumes to purge the O2...and that will take 14 days with the regulator we have. OK, the exit hole is 3<dq> diameter, so we can use full pressure N2 from a 40<sq> rubber hose, and with the calculated flow rate....we<sq>ll have a 75<percent> margin of safety so the tank won<sq>t blow up even though we<sq>re using 75psig N2 on an API 650 tank that only handles 0.5psi overpressure. Etc.<br><br>* **Some engineering.** Most of the engineering is done by our engineering department, but I can usually <dq>pre-design<dq> any new changes before sending them off to the number crunchers. So I can say <dq>We<sq>ll use this tank, and this general instrumentation strategy, and put it roughly here.<dq> Which actually helps A TON, because number crunchers are great for designing for lowest cost and highest performance....but not for the realities of production/operation. I<sq>ve seen so many <dq>manually-actuated<dq> valves 30<sq> in the air with no way to physically access them. Chemical companies are getting better at this...but you still want to have a heavy hand in design when possible.<br><br>* **Oh fuck something broke.** This is when you really need an engineer in production. So, there<sq>s some very toxic gas leaking. Someone already sounded the unit alarms. How to stop it? What<sq>s leaking? How much leaked? Who do we need to report it to? Okay, it<sq>s just after the block valve on the exit of the #2 check tank, so we can shut the block valve, (<dq>THank GOD it<sq>s automated!<dq>...hate sending operators into clouds of toxic gas). Okay it<sq>s not leaking anymore, that was fast. Assuming a pinhole leak, assume a 1/8<dq> hole...bernoulli<sq>s equation...Crane TP-410...Leak calculator tool...Open EPA guidelines...okay we<sq>ve got a Level 2 leak because the HCl gas is over 1 pound. Tell boss they need to report it to the EPA.<br><br>* **Solving gremlins in the process.** Sometimes the weirdest shit goes wrong and you don<sq>t know what in the hell is causing it. Like we couldn<sq>t get a distillation column running correctly for weeks. Then it just fixes itself.<br><br>* **Redoing other people<sq>s work**. This is a huge one. In most meetings, I<sq>d say 40-60<percent> of people are just there to collect a paycheck. Maybe 1/5 are actual hard workers. 2 people can<sq>t do all the work, but the other 8 people<sq>s work SUCKS. I hate this part of the job. Get the results from someone and decide you<sq>ll just re-do it yourself instead of letting the project get behind ANOTHER two weeks.<br><br>* **Keeping operators happy.** Show up early, buy them donuts. Talk to them about their family and hobbies, and the new bullshit procedure your boss just demanded. <br><br>* **Staying in the other engineers<sq> good graces**. Go to their holiday parties, invite them out for beers or a baseball game. Generally glad-hand and slap eachother<sq>s backs. A chemical plant is really just an office job with giant pumps and toxic chemicals. Office politics are very much a real, tangible part of the job.<br></p>",

They are getting better. iDrive (BMW) and Sync (Ford) are substantially improved over what was available just a few years ago.<br><br><br>2. Automotive lead times are long. Cars get a full refresh every 4-8 years or so, and often a partial refresh in between that cycle. That means if someone finishes designing a perfect system tomorrow, it might not make it to market until 2019. Consider that the android/iOS only released 4/5 years ago, in 2008/2007. If you designed a system at the same time as those were, you might only be releasing your first generation today.<br><br><br>3. Automotive hardware generally has very strict requirements, and thus there are few options available. The processor in your phone cannot be used in a car, no OEM could approve it. Electronics that are used in cars are made to function for decades in the harshest weather and highest vibration environments known. Everyone expects that every part of their car will work when its 15 years old, and when its -30F or 110F, while it<sq>s raining, etc. Cell phone processors are not designed to operate in environments that harsh or for that long. They only need a lifetime of 1-3 years. Hardware thus runs slower and later than the versions in other consumer devices. Less hardware means less UI options. I don<sq>t know the actual marketcap for car processors, but I assume it\u2019s rather small compared to cell phones/tablets and thus you wouldn<sq>t expect as much development there either.<br><br><br>I hope that helps provide you some insight into the issues lead to car systems that seem expensive and behind the times. I don<sq>t mean to imply that the quality most companies deliver is acceptable, but above are some of the reasons it happens. Consider that most consumers are starting to replace hard drives with SSDs (Solid State Drive, a type of flash storage) which are immune to vibration, cheaper than what they currently use, and much faster. Yet you still see 10GB and 20GB harddrives used even those you can<sq>t buy less than 250GB has a consumer. Most companies don<sq>t have durable, proven SSDs available for the automotive market yet.

From memory nickel alloys (inconel/monel etc) were typically >9-12 times mild steel and titanium was similarly costed.

I had never done the co-ops or internships many of my peers did so my experience was literally zero. I ended up getting hired into Operations, as an operator, at a plant in a state in a different part of the country. It<sq>s not what I went to school for, but the degree over-qualified me on the education side well enough that they didn<sq>t care I had no prior operations experience like most of the former Navy sailors hired as operators.  <br>  <br>So I did two years as an auxiliary operator at a nuclear plant. That was learning from an operations perspective how the plant worked, how systems were operated, what operators were out observing and why, and then being a busy bee when we did one of our regular refueling shutdowns. At the end of that two years I levered my operations experience into an advantage in applying for a Reactor Engineer position and won it out over the other candidates. My boss wanted someone field-knowledgeable and comfortable with the culture of the plant and I was a perfect fit. This March will mark 11 years working as a Reactor Engineer.  <br>  <br>I refer to starting as an operator as one of the best mistakes I ever made. I learned so much that any engineer at a nuclear plant would benefit to learn and I have a familiarity and comfort with the plant staff that few engineers share. I encourage any Nuclear Engineering students or students looking to work at nuclear power plants to consider starting their career in Operations.</p>",

Obviously, there are many different ways in which a dam can fail, including faulty construction or using inadequate materials. However, assuming that the dam will be built efficiently of suitable materials, earth dams still have a high failure rate because the two most common causes of failure are overtopping and what is known as piping.<br><br>Piping <br><br>This is what happens when water starts to seep through the dam wall and as the water starts to seep it erodes the earth in the way and the more earth is eroded the more water can seep through and the more earth is eroded away so more water can seep through<colon> \u2013 this cycle builds fast, and failure can follow very rapidly indeed. Obviously lining the dam should be some protection against piping, but it is all too likely that the liner will have or will develop flaws or damage, or ultraviolet damage and any holes in the liner will of course allow seepage and thus raise the risk of piping. The liner may help to reduce piping but the use of the liner does not eliminate piping  as cause of failure.<br><br>Clearly earthquakes have the potential to liquefy or shatter part of the dam and we must remember that given the weight of water inside the dam when it is full or near full, once any type of failure starts, it is impossible to stop.<br><br>source<colon> http<colon>//www.ecess.org/globdam.html</p>",

If nothing else, it makes for fun thought-experiments.<br><br>Imagine a large number of small-ish airplanes, all of which have some kind of device on their wingtips that allow them to connect to the wingtip of another airplane. An arbitrarily high number of these airplanes could [form up and fly line-abreast](http<colon>//farm9.staticflickr.com/8282/7779276374_8126074493_z.jpg) and then connect in the air. Maybe some devices could even let some of the airplanes connect top-and-bottom wise, front-and-back wise... It<sq>s not too hard to imagine [a really well-flown formation](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJdMgCMqo9A#t=54s) <dq>conencting up<dq> if the airplanes had some kind of robotic arm for grabbing each other in the air. Imagine dozens of 747s connecting up, into a mile-wide aircraft.<br><br>A centralized control system could fly the whole formation like one big airplane<colon> To roll left, instead of everyone going <dq>left aileron up, right aileron down<dq>, the airplanes on the right could nose-up or deploy flaps and the airplanes on the left could go nose-down or (if the connection is too stiff for that) just deploy their spoilers. For yawing right, instead of everyone<sq>s rudder turning right, maybe the left airplanes could go power-up and the right airplanes would throttle down, etc. NASA has already developed some stuff for [autonomous formation flying](http<colon>//www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/history/pastprojects/AFF/index.html) and autonomous mid-air refueling, so this is not as crazy as it sounds.<br><br>What would prevent this linked-up formation from being practical? Or from just starting out as one huge airplane that took off and landed as one huge machine?<br><br>Well, for one, stiffness. The bigger an airplane is, [the more <dq>wobbly<dq>](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW8I2hX4GSs#t=4m13s) it becomes. This is already true of very large airplanes (the C-5 had all kinds of [flutter](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb3JHY_-ia4#t=4m51s) issues, the 747 had to manage it carefully too), and it<sq>s true of large formations (where a <dq>[ribbon effect](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGdXJ1zYXSY)<dq> makes waves propagate outwards as each airplane reacts more slowly and more intensely to shifts in position of the next-inner airplane).<br><br>Basically, the larger an airplane is, the more it must resemble a flying wing<colon> Almost every part of the airplane must generate lift locally, rather than being structurally supported by a <dq>wing<dq> part that is generating lift really far away. The constraint then becomes<colon> How would your airplane react to a strong gust of wind that affects one region of the airplane more than the other? The [NASA Helios](http<colon>//www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/ResearchUpdate/Helios/index.html) was a flying wing with the span of a 747, so it basically uses this architecture of being like many smaller airplanes stuck together. It came apart in flight when it was hit by a strong gust.<br><br>The first thing that people usually think about when asking <dq>How big can this be scaled up<dq> is the fact that, when something becomes twice as big, it will have eight times the weight but only four times as much area to support that weight. For airplanes, this basically means that more of the airplane has to be wing (again, you approach a flying wing) and that some structure will need to be disproportionately thicker. That last part means that at one point the airplane gets so heavy, it can<sq>t carry much payload.<br><br>Runway widths are another obvious problem... and building a huge seaplane is the obvious solution, like Howard Hughes did. Ether that, or you fly it out of a dry lake bed like they do for some experimental airplanes at NASA Dryden.<br><br>So, my bottom line answer<colon> It depends on the stiffness of the materials you<sq>re willing to use, on how heavy a gust you need the airplane to be able to survive, on how smart and responsive your fly-by-wire is (so that many control surfaces all around the airplane can be continuously adjusted to keep the aerodynamic loads distributed evenly and smoothly... Airbus and the 787 already do this), and of course on whether you need to actually carry some useful payload and fuel or if you<sq>re ok with a plane that can only carry enough fuel for a quick record-setting stunt (in which case you can use thicker structure) rather than for practical transport.</p>",

For example, if some where just outside your substation on your circuit, there is a fault (short circuit) occurring, but the fault is not permanent, like the wind or a falling tree branch causing two phases to make momentary contact. The breaker at the substation will sense fault current in the circuit and open, however, it will immediately close and again look for fault current. If there is no fault current after reclosing, the station breaker will remain closed. If the breaker again sees fault current it will again open, but for a longer amount of time, before reclosing again (the two minute outage). This cycle will typically happen three time before the breaker remains open causing a widespread outage.

Depending on a structure<sq>s purpose, it could be designed to function longer or shorter than that.  Some newer sustainable design practices allow us to design structures that will last 100 years or longer.  The new I-35W bridge in the Twin Cities I believe has a design length of 100+ years.  Some sort of concrete additive was used in the bridge that allows the bridge to <dq>clean itself<dq> to some degree in order to prevent corrosion within the reinforcing steel.<br><br>Regular maintenance will likely always be required though.  Every structure should have a maintenance plan.  Common tasks would be standard maintenance inspections, i.e. checking for cracking in concrete or corrosion in steel.  Things like that.  The frequency of maintenance is largely dependent upon weathering and usage factors.  As an example, the Tower Industry Association code, TIA-222, generically recommends an inspection be performed every 3 years.  This is great for regions that don<sq>t see drastic weathering effects, but it<sq>s certainly not sufficient for places like Hawaii where acidic rain from volcano ash and heavy sea breezes can batter a tower with corrosive water on a regular basis.  Regions like that may need inspections every 6-12 months.  Regional knowledge and experience is beneficial to be considered when developing a good maintenance plan.<br><br>Outside weathering isn<sq>t the only factor though.  Factories and power generating facilities often have various water sources that can create humid air, or if left unattended may lead to leakage and ponding which can create premature damage issues.  Things like repetitive exposure to heavy loads, or fatigue loading, also need to be accounted for.  If an area is designed for foot traffic only but the owner decides to use that area as a heavy equipment transport area, you might see early signs of failure and fatigue.<br><br>Just because a structure reaches its <dq>life-expectancy<dq> doesn<sq>t mean it<sq>s going to undergo some catastrophic failure.

That team could then make recommendations on how long they expect the structure will remain functional and also recommend any pertinent improvements that should be made.  This would effectively lengthen the design life of the structure.<br><br>Blah blah, hope that helps!<br><br>I recommend Googling the new I-35W bridge.

Electric motors deliver their maximum torque at zero RPM, while IC engines typically have low torque at low RPM and peak torque somewhere in the middle of their range. Torque and angular acceleration (which translates to straight-line acceleration) are directly proportional, so more torque right when you mash the accelerator pedal means higher acceleration off the line. It<sq>s worth mentioning that this advantage goes away at higher RPMs, when IC engines are making peak torque and electric motors are making much less.<br><br>Batteries, sensors, controllers, etc. also play a huge part in achieving high accelerations.

There was so much to know to do a complex job RIGHT that you were never going to learn on the job.  Hell, for them to teach you up to their level it would basically be school with them getting little to nothing out of you and them acting as professor instead of doing their job. <br><br>So I began work on MSME specializing in Fluid and Thermal Science.  I enjoyed that so much more than undergrad and became the sole CFD analyst for a company with no previous CFD experience.  Wow, all of a sudden there was minimal paperwork, no part order, no manufacturer or supplier relations, no design responsibility that required significant record keeping.  All my paperwork was technical writing of reports, best practices, and standard analysis procedures, independently, based 100<percent> on what I acquired from school.

[Like this](http<colon>//practicalmaintenance.net/wp-content/uploads/Motion-of-a-dislocation-as-it-encounters-a-grain-boundary.jpg) - you can see how if you push from the left to the right, you will cause deformation in one grain before the other, normally this is mitigated as all grains are about the same size, meaning you have to put substantial force to cause a deformation and that the deformation wont be uniform.<br><br>Sheet copper and other metal is made by taking a block and rolling it flat after many many passes - that makes the metal grains very thin and long (like rolling a ball of dough). That means that when you push in metal that has been rolled, the deformation happens along the planes that have the best geometry (and are now large and don<sq>t have other grains to prevent the deformation from occurring evenly). Thus, you see the pattern as there are always grains of this geometry, and the deformation occurs along them in a very predictable pattern.<br><br>You can see the exact same type of deformation in plastics such as when you pull a plastic bag apart - it is failing at the boundary that is easiest to pull apart.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Oh! A question for me! (Power utility engineer)<br><br>The basic gist of it has already been answered by others here. Most organizations just aren<sq>t in the business of manufacturing power, and don<sq>t want to deal with it. Doing it efficiently on large scales is still expensive, and requires specialized staff. Many customers still want a grid connection for backup type situations anyways. As has also been mentioned already, some organizations do actually have their own generation, micro grids, etc.<br><br>I<sq>ll try to touch on the economics a bit, as you mention 19 cents/kWh as if that<sq>s just <dq>the cost of power.<dq> That<sq>s not really the case. The economics differ greatly by region, and even within a particular power company there are a number of rate structures a customer could choose from, each of which is generally approved by some sort of regulating body, usually the state. (I<sq>m really only familiar with Wisconsin.)<br><br>Power lines are expensive to build, and when we have to build long lines covering vast areas for smaller rural/suburban residential customers, that<sq>s a lot of investment for not a whole lot of return. These customers are generally going to be on the more expensive consumption driven rates like you mention above (kWh).<br><br>If we have a larger customer coming online, perhaps a high rise, or factory, or a mall, that<sq>s a whole lot of power they<sq>re gonna be buying. Whatever assets we have serving that load, we<sq>re likely going to recoup that cost much more quickly. We can afford to give them a cheaper rate. These larger customers are often billed based on their peak demand within a given monthly period (kW, pf) rather than consumption (kWh). Certain venues, like a sports arena, might have a very high demand, but peak at times that the remainder of the grid is relatively lightly loaded. This also gives them options for different rate structures where they can buy power cheaper at certain times because it doesn<sq>t stress the system, thus not requiring additional significant investment on our end. <br><br>The above is definitely over-simplified. All our assets are intertwined, as is the customer base, so we try to balance to cost of maintaining and upgrading the system with the revenue we expect from a given rate structure, customer base, market trends, etc. I know I<sq>ve addressed more on the distribution side of the costs than the generation side, which I think was your initial intent, but it plays a lot into the total cost of energy. The point I<sq>m trying make is that for companies that might be at the scale where self-generating starts to become reasonable, the power utility makes itself competitive. This benefits both parties - the power company makes money, and the customer doesn<sq>t have to deal with making their own power.</p>",

So you only really want to convert AC to DC if a device absolutely requires DC.<br><br>The only devices that require DC are electronics / embedded processors. These are all generally low power, so the efficiency losses from AC to DC are not too much of a concern.<br><br>But for very high power items, such as HVAC systems or appliances like refrigerators, ovens, dryers, etc, switching from AC to DC at the meter would only drive up your electric bill. For example, let<sq>s say Appliance X requires 2 kilowatts of power to function. If you design it to run on AC, it uses 2 kilowatts. If you design it to run on DC and if the AC-DC converter is 80<percent> efficient, it will now require 2.5 kilowatts of AC input. You<sq>d now be paying for another 500 Watts on your electric bill for a totally useless purpose.<br><br>So now we get to a bigger question<colon> why is the electric grid AC? The answer to this is fairly simple<colon><br><br>The electric grid is really just a way of transferring power (Watts) using electricity. The way to express this is power = volts * amps (current). You can have the same power with either really high voltage and low current, or low voltage and high current.<br><br>Remember how nothing in life is 100<percent> efficient? This even includes electric wires; they lose power in the form of heat. The power losses here can be described as power = electrical resistance * current ^ 2. The current squared term means that high voltage/low current power lines are way more efficient at transmitting power than low voltage/high current lines.<br><br>But we can<sq>t make everything really high voltage. The high voltages needed to transmit electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles would be completely unsafe inside a home or factory. Common insulations like plastic or rubber cannot insulate really high voltage without being ungodly thick, making it unpractical to use inside buildings.<br><br>So this means that to transfer electricity efficiently over long distances, we need high voltage, but to use it safely in houses or businesses, we need low voltage. And this is where AC won the electric wars. It<sq>s way easier and more efficient to convert AC to higher or lower voltages using transformers than it is to convert DC to higher or lower voltages. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Step 0) establish easy survival - shelter, water, food, fire. This is going to take awhile, so you better setup and get things things in order in such a way that you have at least a couple hrs a day that you don<sq>t have to spend on these tasks.  For each step, expect to fail multiple times and learn how to change things to your needs.<br><br>Step 1) Find iron.  Scrap would be great, but you said thats a no go, so you are going to have to find iron ore.  You could do this with bronze, but IDK of anywhere in the world where copper and tin are found in the same place, so you are going to have to go iron.   There is no guarantee your island as any iron resources and even if it does, it could be pyrite which is next to useless here.<br><br>Step 2) assuming you found iron, make charcoal. Get some good dry wood (beach wood works great).  Build a mud container about 4 cubic feet. Add a small air inlet and outlet, but just barely enough to keep a fire lit. You aren<sq>t trying to maximize the amount of flame, you want the flame to just barely survive. Fill the mud container with wood and light it up.  This makes charcoal.<br><br>Step 3) - Smelt Iron. Dig a hole in refractory sand. The hole doesn<sq>t need to be too big, you are going to want to start small. Not any sand will work and if you don<sq>t know your sand types, you are going to have to trial and error this through lots of different sands and muds. Bad sand will turn to glass and you are SOL for smelting.  Again, there is no guarantee that such sand/mud exists on the island. But dig a hole in sand and then find some type of blow tube. Reed is great but you may have to be creative.  Place the blow tube so one end is at the base of the hole and the other sticking up out of the ground.   Now put the iron ore and charcoal into the pit, lit it on fire, and blow. Blow and blow until you can<sq>t blow any more. Then breath and blow again.   If you are lucky and you got the hole right and the iron/charcoal mix right for your type of ore, you will get a small amount of iron.<br><br>Step 4) Pottery.  You need to find some clay and get some basic pottery. Again, need the right clay and will have to trial and error this. Using charcoal, you will also need to make a firing oven out of mud. This time, you will need to maximize flame and heat and make a two chamber system where the charcoal is burned and then the gas is directed into a second chamber to fire the clay before it can exit the oven. <br><br>Step 5) Knife and Saw.  Find a flat rock that can be used as an anvil.  Find a smaller rock to use as a hammer. Improvise tongs of some sort.  Dig a pit, put in charcoal, put in blow tube, put iron into charcoal until its orange hot, but not melting. Pull iron out with tongs, put on anvil, hammer it until its dull red, repeat.  Do this until you have drawn out a piece roughly blade shaped (its going to take awhile). After you like the shape, get it orange hot and dip it into water (it may break the metal and you have to repeat and trial and error the color between quenching, the right color will be based on the quality of the iron) then heat it back to red hot and then let it air cool.  When its cool, find a stone to sharpen it.    You have a wrought iron knife.   Repeat this process again for a flat piece of iron about two feet long and about 1/4<dq> thick or as thin as your iron lets you go. This piece is your saw. You don<sq>t need saw teeth or sharpening. This saw is used by placing sand on what you want to cut and moving this piece of iron back and forth.  The sand does the cutting, the saw just moves sand across a surface.<br><br>Step 5 alternative) If there is the right stone around, like obsidian because the island if volcanic, you can make a stone knife that is better than the iron knife. This will take skill to develop the ability to crack stones together to make a good blade edge.<br><br>Step 6) Drilling.  Find three rocks, one roughly 1 ft in diameter, as close to wheel shape as you can find, the other a bit larger than that one. If you can find a softer rock likely sandstone, that will help.  For one, you are going to have to chip it away to make it roughly wheel shaped. For all three, you are going to have to drill a hole through them. To drill a hole through rock, find a strong hard stick and a soft bendy stick.  Find something to make string (reeds again help, but you may have to trial and error lots of plants to find something of enough strength).  Us the string to make a bow with the bendy stick. Place some sand on the rock, put hard stick on the rock, wrap the bow around the hard stick, hold  a small rock on top of the hard stick, and move the bow back and forth. You will have to change out the sand once in a while, but you will eventually drill a hole. Again, this is going to take awhile to get through all three rocks. <br><br>Step 7) Lathe<colon> Take the two bigger rocks into the ground and align the as best you can.  Get a strong stick and put it through the smaller wheel rock. Strap the stick to the rock as best as you can figure out. Put it all together so the big rocks hold up the stick and small rock and you have a shaft sticking out of the side. Get it aligned well enough that you can turn the small rock and get at least ten rotations. You may need to find some type of grease from animal or plant to grease the bearings. This is a hand powered lathe, so get use to the work out to keep it rolling. <br><br>Step 8) turn a better axial for the Lathe<colon> Get a long, hard stick and carve it (with your knife) best you can into a rod. Make it the axial of the lathe but have the stick be at least twice the needed length. Use the lathe and knife to make a nice smooth wooden axial and replace carved axial. <br><br>Step 9) Improve the lathe again.  Use the lathe to make two wooden bearings.  Replace friction heavy rocks with wooden bearings.   Use blacksmithing ability to make nails for fasteners if you need them.<br><br>Step 10) Casting.  Get that refractory sand and some firing clay and mix it together. Something stiff enough that you can mold it like clay but loose enough that you can brush it away.  This is green sand.  Use some green sand to make a cup, fire that cup with pottery oven. This is your crucible. Expect to need to make a new crucible for every firing, a better alumina crucible is beyond your abilities right now.  Make a sand molding box.  This is where the saw comes in handy.  Dig a hole, this one pretty deep and narrow, put in charcoal, place blow hole, put crucible in the pit, put smelted iron into the crucible.    Make tongs, you can make a set with black smithing skills if necessary. <br><br>Step 11) Improve the Lathe.  Take those wooden bearings, make a sand mold with them, use casting pit to make molten iron (will take a lot of blowing) and pour yourself new bearings. Use some smooth sand and wooden dowel to smooth inside of new iron bearings.   Repeat to have a piece of iron that will attach to the wooden axial where the axial lies on the iron bearings.  Use the lathe with wood and sand to make a smooth outer.  <br><br>Step 12) Improve the lathe.  Maybe you need a better turning wheel, the part that is still rock.  Carve the wheel you want, cast it in Iron and improve the lathe.  Maybe the wood you can find isn<sq>t hard enough.  Blacksmith a new iron rod, best you can, then put it on the lathe and make a better axial.    Repeat until you have the best lathe you can get.<br><br>Step 13) Choosing a power pathway.  You need to either choose a low power or high power route.  If the island has any source of copper, choose the low power route. If not, high power, while longer, is likely needed for success.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>OK, as a huge multimeter nut, something that I know a LOT about. This is a long post but it<sq>s a simple question with a VERY complex answer.<br><br>The high cost of a Fluke comes from more than one particular reason. While we all know Fluke makes high quality meters, to say something has quality is a generic term, which truthfully has no meaning at all. It is like saying something is good, what may be good for me might not be good for you. In reality, the cost and quality is the combination of multiple things (some may be worth it, some not). More importantly, what is worth it and what is not is unique to every individual. So deciding what is worth it means knowing what you need to evaluate.<br><br>**Safety**<br>First, and foremost, the reason for the high cost is safety. Fluke multimeters almost universally are rated to CAT III 600V or higher, with many being CAT III 1kV and CAT IV 600V. What this means is that even in industrial settings where a 600V line might be able to supply 10s or 100s of A, these meters will still fail safely without injury to the user. The same can<sq>t be said for many cheaper meters, which when subjected to these conditions will arc over and possibly explode in the users hand, injuring or killing the user. Specifically, the CAT designation (I, II, III and IV) indicate the kind of electrical environment the meter is rated to handle. <br><br>* **CAT I** is basically low voltage stuff, signal level voltages, fused 12V lighting, circuits powered by regulated low voltage supplies, etc.<br><br>* **CAT II** is wall-outlet level stuff. Specifically, wall-outlets far removed from the circuit breaker/junction box and plug in loads.  This can be things like household appliances, wall-outlets in rooms, etc.<br><br>* **CAT III** This is for junction boxes, circuit breakers and outlets attached to or near the junction box. Truth be told, due to its relatively arbitrary nature there is very little difference in the real world between CAT II and CAT III. If you need CAT II then you likely should be using CAT III anyways. <br><br>* **CAT IV** This is installation and industrial level voltages. So this would be rated for the source side of the circuit breaker box and in industrial settings where huge currents can be sourced. <br><br>To achieve the various ratings they must be able to withstand the following [voltage ratings](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/SZhUiA7.png) from devices with source impedances listed at the bottom of each column. This means, to achieve a CAT IV 1kV rating, the meter must be able to withstand a 12kV voltage spike from a device capable of sourcing 6kA! These are no easy numbers to achieve and are often faked on lower quality meters. For Fluke, and a few other reputable manufacturers, these numbers are real world, UL-certified numbers that you can trust. Additionally, the meter can just be safe, the safety features can<sq>t affect the measurements as well. There is a LOT of research and development that goes into developing high quality safe input protection that doesn<sq>t affect the measurements. All in all, you need a sensitive ADC with high input impedance (usually 10MOhms or greater), PTC on many of the functions. You also need (HRC) high rupture current fuses (quite expensive but essential for getting the CAT ratings) and MOVs or spark gaps on the current ranges, a case designed to contain the gases from an exploding fuse or MOV, etc. I know this introduces a lot of acronyms that I didn<sq>t define, I can go in to them further if you wish but I omit defining them and their function for brevity sake. I will say this though, HRC fuses are a MUST for a meter. If your meter has glass fuses, then it is unsafe for current (meaning A/mA/uA) measurements even for household work.  <br><br>**Accuracy, Precision and Resolution**<br>We can<sq>t discuss quality without discussing the quality of the measurements. There are three components to measurement that must be addressed<colon> Accuracy, Precision and Resolution. Accuracy and Precision are related to each other, and often confused for one another, but are not the same thing. Accuracy measure how close the average of a series of measurements is to its real value. Precision is how close a series of measurements of the same value are to each other. I often use an image like [this one](http<colon>//academic.greensboroday.org/~regesterj/potl/BasicSkills/SigFigs/darts.png) to indicate the concept. A quality meter will be both accurate and precise and have VERY VERY well defined accuracy and precision definitions for all of the functions and ranges. These will be included in the manual and as such allow you to evaluate your readings accordingly. <br><br>Resolution is how detailed the readings on your meter are; this is often called counts. A 2000 count meter can show a maximum value of 2000 on any range (so the 2V range is 2.000V), while a 20,000 count meter can show 2.0000V on the 2V range. The meter that reads 2.0000V is often more accurate and precise than a meter that reads 2.000V, but this is not always the case. There are a few meters with decent accuracy and precision but high resolution. This isn<sq>t a show stopper, there are  times when you need the resolution more than you need the accuracy. Such as watching a battery slowly drain, you don<sq>t care if the batteries voltage is 14.1241 or 14.2334, what you care is watching as it counts down 14.1241, 14.1240, 14.1239, etc. To see how the battery is draining as time goes on. <br><br>**Reliability and Robustness**<br>When you read the voltage on your meter and it says 120.12V AC, how certain are you in this reading. If you read it 6 months from now, will it read 120.12V AC or will it read 140.32V AC (an exaggeration of course but one done to illustrate a point). Fluke put a lot of research into creating meters which maintain their calibration very solidly. The only meters that I have ever found out of calibration were either abused or over two decades old (when they were using potentiometers to set calibration). Truthfully, at this point most modern meters hold their calibration pretty well, but not all. When you purchase Fluke, or other reputable manufacturers, you are getting something that you KNOW meets, and likely beats its rated specifications. With other manufacturers, some of their meters might be the same but one or two others might not and you never know which one without testing. There is cost in this peace of mind. Also, most quality meters are rated to withstand a certain amount of physical abuse, some meters even have IP ratings for water and dust resistance. This used to be very very important when calibration was set by mechanical potentiometers, now that most calibration is in software it is not as critical an issue (unless you need the water or dust resistance). <br><br>Another thing to note related to this, is that if your meter does drift out of spec, with reputable manufacturers it is very easy (though not cheap) to send it to a calibration lab and have a calibration and adjustment performed on it to get it back in spec. With cheaper meters, this is not possible, once it is out of spec it is out of spec for good. <br><br>**Durability**<br>One thing I feel I must touch on is that the safety regulations are not always an indication of the meters ability to survive high voltages. The regulation only require that the meter must FAIL safely and make no requirements about them surviving. That being said often times, the designs that enable the meter to withstand a high voltage spike and fail safely also enable it to withstand higher than normal voltage spikes and keep working. Voltage spikes like these are very common when working on inductive inputs like transformers and motors (including compressors like on refrigerators and AC units) and as such, if your work involves working on loads like these then you should look be looking at top quality meters because they might save you money in the long run (spend $200-400 one time versus spend $50 a dozen times). Similarly, the quality of the housing is very important, if you drop it from 10 ft and is shatters, you just lost your meter. Most meters now have rubberized cases to prevent this but some still use very cheap quality plastics and materials which can fail over time. <br><br>**Functions**<br>We can<sq>t discuss quality without discussion features. Believe it or not, in this day and age functions are cheap to add. It used to be VERY VERY expensive to add functions to your meter but just like with cellphones, most functions have moved on to the main processor (SoC). Companies like Cyrustek, Fortune, etc. have created dedicated multimeter ICs with pretty much every function imaginable. So with one IC, a manufacturer can pick and choose which functions they want to enable or ignore to set their model line. Because of this, the function list of many cheap meters meets or beats many quality meters. Many of the most venerable meters (like the 87V) had their feature list set back when functions were costly to add. Unfortunately, this is one area where Fluke used to shine but really hasn<sq>t kept up the pace in innovation. After their acquisition by Danaher, they didn<sq>t do much in the way of innovation and allowed other companies to really catch up. Danaher recently announced that they are spinning of their test and measurement division (which includes Tektronix, Keithley, Fluke, Pamona, etc.) so hopefully this will change. <br><br><br></p>",

At the same time, because the licenses were only valid for 40 years at a time, 40 years was a convenient design criteria for demonstrating the original plant can make it to the end of its license life without any of the non-replaceable equipment exceeding its operating limits. This does not mean a plant<sq>s operating life is limited to 40 years, but it does mean to go beyond 40 years, any non-replaceable components need to be evaluated based on the actual wear and tear they received. Additionally, there are typically many major maintenance items which may need to be performed. For example, the plant I<sq>m at now, our dry transformers were tested and qualified for a 40 year lifespan, and we have plans to replace all of these if/when we go into license extension.<br><br>For new plant builds, the original design life is 60 years, even though the license is 40 years. A license extension is expected for these plants.<br><br>For major components. No reactor pressure vessel has ever been replaced in US nuclear power plants, and no plant has plans to ever replace the vessel. This is extremely challenging, and would likely not be worth the cost. Instead, a combination of methods are used to extend the life of the vessel. First up, when we designed the vessels, we used very over-conservative estimates for how neutron flux would damage the vessel. This was because of limited data. Inside the vessel are capsules that contain the metal which was forged with the vessel. Those capsules are removed periodically to test their strength, which in turn gives a very good estimate of how much neutron embrittlement the vessel has received. In the life of these plants we have discovered a few things. First, we are doing less damage overall than we thought. Second, that in most cases less neutrons than expected reach the vessel. Third, that reflectors or low-leakage core loading designs reduce neutron fluence to the vessel even further. We also have been seeing that most plants have not caused as many transients on the vessels which have the potential to cause fatigue. This all leads to a longer useful life for the vessel. For some plants, they may need to adjust their vessel operating limits to account for embrittlement. Specifically, raising the minimum temperature for criticality or pressurization. Many plants are also incorporating new models and methods for analyzing vessel stress and fatigue limits in combination with new inspection methods and more frequent inspections, allowing those plants to either extend their vessel limits or reduce the necessary design margins (by getting more accurate, you can use more of the available margin and still retain the same or greater safety limits). Finally, there is always the option to anneal the vessel to help deal with embrittlement and extend the life of the vessel, although no commercial power unit operating in the US has done this.<br><br>Many components get replacements or reworks. The main turbine and generator are typically reworked once in the life of the plant. Many plants try to combine these rework costs in with power uprates or other capital projects to help absorb the cost of it. The generator stator will need additional rewinds every 15 years or so. The main feed pumps and other turbine drives at the plant have insurance requirements for major inspections and maintenance every 8-12 years. Safety system motors and pumps typically are not replaced unless performance degrades or they are utilized past their design limits. I know at my plant, we have some safety equipment that we have notes to not use for more than X hours per month/year for non-emergency situations, in order to ensure they will still have sufficient design life in the event a major accident occurs and they need to function for a month straight. The emergency diesel generators are reworked roughly every 1000 hours or 10 years. This is major maintenance where the engine is literally torn apart and rebuilt, and its generator is usually rewound or reworked. Other maintenance is performed every 2-4 years. <br><br>For control systems, it varies from plant to plant. For major I&C systems most plants have installed one or more digital systems such as digital feedwater/level controls, digital turbine/EHC (electrohydraulic controls), digital generator voltage regulators, digital core flow controllers, digital reactor protection/scram systems. Just about all plants have been replacing analog controllers and relay logic with digital equipment in the past 5-10 years. Digital I&C is very far behind in the nuclear industry, especially on safety systems, due to the extensive requirements, lack of qualified vendors/engineering firms to design digital safety systems, and inexperience with the regulator on licensing these systems. The plant I<sq>m at now got its first major digital control system last year (feedwater). Many plants opt to only replace things which have significant benefits. I know in my plant<sq>s case, feedwater controls have always been a significant issue and have caused many scrams and operational headaches during transients, so we really wanted to get it installed. Other major systems may stay with the original analog components and even going as far as to have parts reverse engineered and rebuilt to the same quality standards, as its easier than dealing with the regulatory requirements and re-training your operators/maintenance. <br><br>One final mention about maintenance rule and other regulatory requirements. All nuclear plants in the US are required per 10CFR50.65 and other regulations to have a maintenance effectiveness program. All equipment is categorized based on its importance (very roughly<colon> safety, important to safety, important to plant reactivity, important to plant operations, non-critical, or not scoped). The equipment which directly affects nuclear safety needs to have preventative maintenance programs which assure that failures do not occur. Additionally repeat failures are not allowed. If a component fails at a different plant, and we fail to fix it at our plant, that<sq>s considered a repeat failure, because we all share component failure data across the entire US nuclear industry and we are required to fix problems that originated at other plants if we are susceptible. Anyways, the system engineers are responsible for determining maintenance requirements for systems, ensuring that they have the appropriate PMs and major maintenance requirements scheduled and performed, and also determining if maintenance needs to be performed more or less frequently. If equipment does fail, that equipment needs to be repaired based on its importance, with safety systems and important to safety systems also having operating license impacts which need to be fixed in a timely fashion or result in the mandatory shutdown of the unit. (The operating license/technical specifications are very explicit about the minimum equipment required for the plant to safety operate and actions required if that is not met). <br><br>This is just a bit of an overview about how nuclear plants deal with long plant life. The tl;dr is that they are required to either replace equipment before it exceeds its design life, or ensure that the equipment can last until the end of the license term.

At 8000 feet, that pressure falls to 10.9 psia. By 35,000 feet, it<sq>s all the way down to 3.5 psia. The important part, of course, is the delta between the inside and outside (fuselages are sometimes rated in pressure delta rather than specific altitudes). Flying at 35,000 feet, an internal pressure of sea level is a delta of 11.2 psi, while an internal pressure of 8000 feet is a delta of 7.4 psi. Increasing the cabin altitude to 8000 feet means the fuselage only has to withstand 66<percent> of the pressure delta at cruising altitude. <br><br>Airplanes are incredibly weight sensitive - even a few pounds can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel consumption / lost cargo capacity over the life of the plane. The extra material necessary to accommodate that extra pressure delta safely will add noticeable weight to the cost of the plane, and significant increase in lifetime operating cost - for little to no benefit. <br><br>TL;DR - higher cabin altitude allows for safe operation with a lower strength fuselage, which reduces weigh and thus operating cost of aircraft, with minimal negative consequences. </p>",

The faster you collapse the field, the more the voltage will spike. If you create and collapse a field very very quickly by - for example - switching power to the inductor on and off you will see an output that looks like a whole bunch of large voltage spikes.

You need to plug it in periodically.* People can be astonishingly stupid. If you don<sq>t believe me, work in a mall for a few years.<br>* Many Li-ion batteries come conditioned straight from the OEM, but sometimes the cathode/anodes still need forming. That is, a flat plate has a surface area we can get from its dimensions. For batteries, the surface areas of the cathode/anode determine how fast it can discharge. Once it<sq>s been charged and discharged, that flat plate develops a rough, fuzzy texture with much more surface area. (This is a much bigger issue with older battery technologies like lead-acid and NiMH, but it still remains a factor even in Li-Ion)<br>* It is not easy to determine the state of charge(The battery<sq>s remaining capacity, 50<percent> for example), or SOC, of Lithium-ion batteries. Complex circuits are used that build models, but these are entirely mathematical and may or may not reflect the actual chemistry going on within the battery. By charging the battery to full, they have a much better change of getting a 100<percent>-to-0<percent> cycle in the customer<sq>s day. This full cycle gives the circuit a chance to confirm that the battery actually has the properties it expects.<br>* Phones need to download several important files when they are first activated - PRL lists are the first ones that come to mind, but firmware updates and other gobbledygook are also involved. If the battery is too low, the phone may shut off in the middle of an important process and corrupt a file it needs to do things like, oh, make calls or establish data connections. This is also why your computer yells at you for shutting down unexpectedly.<br>* Lithium-ion batteries can fail catastrophically. Not like a NiMH cell, which fails by spraying caustic electrolyte - no no, a Li-ion cell can fail with [an explosion of hydrogen gas](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMy2_qNO2Y0) and [a lithium fire following soon after.](http<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvUjIWEVRnY) So in the sake of safety, it<sq>s a good idea for the manufacturer to have the battery charge up to 100<percent> while on a charger - someplace the user (probably) won<sq>t be holding it, and it would do much less damage if it failed. The charger would also help reduce heat buildup while the phone is running, which also helps contribute to battery failure. This reduces the chance of a faulty OEM battery burning someone, and instead turns that same case into a simple angry customer returning a phone with a bad battery. Much better outcome!<br><br>So to answer your question, yes the <dq>better safe than sorry<dq> approach does play a large role, but so do various technical procedures that the battery and phone may need to perform on startup.</p>",

This is great because it allows the engine to idle at a stop, without any action required to go except to take your foot off the brake and hit the gas.<br><br>The downside is there are inherent losses associated with this <dq>fluid<dq> connection due to turbulent flow turning into heat, vibration, sound, etc. Manual transmissions, while in gear, are mechanically linked from the engine all the way down to the wheels, which limits their losses to pure friction between gears and in bearings. These amount to less than is lost in an automatic transmission.<br><br>An additional factor is weight and gearing. The typical automatic transmission is a good deal heavier than its manual counterpart. In my subaru, there<sq>s like a 150 lb difference between the two. So, essentially, driving the automatic is like constantly having a passenger.  Also, until recently, the average automatic transmission was only 4 speeds instead of the typical 5 found in a manual transmission. More gears means that a savvy driver can keep their car in the proper rpm range for maximum efficiency better than a car with fewer gears. In practice, automatics are geared higher so they tend to suffer more in acceleration than fuel efficiency but it<sq>s still something to consider.<br><br>Recently, the gap has been closing between the two because modern autos are locking the torque converter at much lower speeds than they have in previous years thanks to improvements in computer control.

                "answer": "<p>For those of you saying that titanium<sq>s raw material price isn<sq>t as significant as the machining costs associated with processing it, I really think you<sq>re underestimating how truly expensive the raw material costs become.  Titanium is definitely hard to work with, but part of the reason it<sq>s still so expensive is because through all that machining and processing, a lot of yield is lost.  Note<colon> I work for a titanium mill.<br><br>In steel, yields of 20-40<percent> from start to finish are no big deal and depending on the application, normal.  But with titanium, those kinds of yields are horrendous.<br><br>To try and compare apples to apples, steel scrap tends to sell for roughly $0.10/lb.  Titanium scrap, on the other hand, can sell anywhere between $1.50-$10/lb depending on how much titanium scrap is available on the market and what the demand for it is.<br><br>Another huge factor in the price is the extra care that companies use when processing titanium just to save on yield like more careful forging, grinding, rolling, etc etc.  If we make 100 sheets and 10 get rejected for some quality issue, that<sq>s a big loss for us.  For steel, that kind of loss is negligible.  Companies go to great lengths to try and save even 3<percent> on yield.<br><br>On top of that, even though titanium has been commercially produced for 60+ years, the industry uses largely the same equipment as steel mills.  While the processes are largely the same, there are nuances that titanium needs which can be cost prohibitive to implement because most equipment manufacturers are making their equipment for steel producers.<br><br>Plus, if titanium came into wider use, it would become even cheaper because titanium companies would have more incentive to upgrade their equipment to make it faster, cheaper, and more efficient.  Right now, there is so much variability in demand for titanium that companies are hesitant to upgrade equipment because by the time they installed a major upgrade and got it up and running (which would be 1-3 years realistically), they might fall into a lull in demand for titanium which could last a year or two.  The huge variations in demand for titanium are a big problem for companies that are constantly trying to stay profitable.<br><br>In short, yeah, titanium is harder to work with than steel, but that<sq>s a relatively small factor in why it<sq>s so expensive.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Efficiency is not everything. In power production efficiency (for typical fuel fired systems) is measured by heat rate (typically BTU/kW). From a business perspective this is only half the equation. The other hugely important number is $/BTU (IE fuel price). Now logic dictates that heat rate times fuel price yields $/kWh (kWh is what you sell obviously scaled to larger numbers). Lower energy fuels (like coal) typically have a lower cost per BTU (logically). <br><br>Now you know what it cost you to produce what your selling. Half your fuel price with half the heat rate will yield equal cost power.<br><br>There is more to the story though of course, involving the non fuel costs. These costs include fixed installation costs, operating and maintenance costs, regulatory restrictions, capacity, load type (base, wheeling, and peaking), and many other important considerations.<br><br>Now why do we use steam. Lets follow a logical path. Realistically, the only type of energy generation that can meet all the requirements of the grid (in the largest picture) is electricity produced by rotating equipment. So, the question is what is the most effective (cheap and efficient) way to rotate a generator? Well if your fuel is liquid and has a high energy density a direct fired turbine is a logic choice (with a HRSG for bonus points). Efficient, build-able, and they can be scaled within reason. Now liquid (or gas) fuels are historically expensive relative to lower energy solid fuels (here is looking at you coal). Now obviously you can<sq>t burn coal in a turbine. <br><br>So question, what is the easiest way to concentrate energy of low energy fuel so you can turn a large mass? Well that<sq>s a good question (and maybe the question that answers your question). The only way other than steam, that I can think of is coal gasification (syngas).<br><br>TLDR; we use steam turbines, because it<sq>s the easiest way to concentrate low energy (and cheap) fuel.</p>",

This sounds potentially quite a bit more serious, possibly with a strong depression component. If you<sq>ve been through a protracted stressful period that left you feeling helpless and out of control without a healthy mental framework for handling stress, you very well could have plunged in to a depressive episode.<br><br>For some perspective, one of the methods used by depression researchers to induce depressive-like models in animal studies is the chronic unpredictable mild stress model. Animals chronically exposed to stressors that they can<sq>t escape from or deal with almost always develop depressive symptoms. Obviously you<sq>re not a lab rat, but the same stress-induced depression risk still applies.<br><br>The good news is that this is not new territory, and there are a lot of ways to address this. The bad news is that people in your shoes are notoriously good at coming up with excuses to not address their issues and/or feeling too helpless to do anything about it. To that end, I<sq>ll just go ahead and provide some rebuttals to the usual excuses that most people in your situation come up with<colon><br><br>1) <dq>I can<sq>t afford to get help<dq> - Addressing depressive-type issues doesn<sq>t necessarily mean visits to expensive psychiatrists and expensive medications. A good GP will be well-versed in getting you started on addressing these issues with a single visit and can rule out underlying conditions that will mimic burnout/depression (thyroid issues, etc.) very quickly. It<sq>s well worth your time and money to visit a doctor and get started there. This doesn<sq>t necessarily mean you<sq>ll go down the medication route either, but if you do you should also know that most anti-depressants are available as generics now, often for $5/month. If nothing else, the price of medical evaluation and treatment is cheaper than lost wages from another month of unemployment. Think of it as an investment in yourself and your career.<br><br>2) <dq>I don<sq>t want to take medications<dq> - That<sq>s fine, because there are plenty of ways to address this issue that don<sq>t necessarily involve medication. In fact, depending on the severity of your burnout you may be better off with a regimented program of exercise, a good diet, some self-directed CBT-type training, and setting some incremental goals toward improving your well-being. The most important thing here is to acknowledge the issues, set a plan for incrementally improving yourself with small, attainable steps, and following through on it. Doing *anything* along these lines will go a long way here. Consider this<colon> In anti-depressant studies, even the patients given *placebo* actually improve quite a bit, just because they feel like they<sq>re moving toward getting better. Amazing, isn<sq>t it? Go run or walk or lift weights or do anything, but do it every day.<br><br>3) <dq>I<sq>ll get right on this... tomorrow.<dq> - Nope, start today. Go for a walk, and set a goal to walk a little farther tomorrow. Set a goal to start a very small project by the end of the week, even if it<sq>s just updating your LinkedIn profile. Add a little bit more to the project next week, doing just a bit more than the week before. Keep the steps small but progressively larger. Build your sense of ability back up one step at a time, but don<sq>t kick yourself if you slip or move backward.<br><br>Good luck!</p>",

The thing is with office politics, is that if you want to manipulate yourself into opportunities, or have a particular path you want to grow in, i would personally avoid sharing the plan. <br><br>After the first few years of <dq>learning the ropes<dq>, building your skill set in your particular industry, it should be time to have a couple of career steps in mind. Career steps such as an immediate step out of your <dq>trainee<dq> role and the next step after this one (3 years or whatever is typical in your industry). This could mean a different country, a different department, maybe a different path than what your boss and his boss want you to do. The way office politics plays in this, is really up to whether or not you want to take the <sq>typical<sq> path, or if you want to move a little more quickly. <br><br>Generally, you will find that your interpersonal relationships with your team, the teams around you, your vendors, your competitors etc will give you the support structure to reach your goals. However, sharing your ambition and plan with your peers, or with people above you that are afraid of losing their <sq>seats<sq> will allow them to figure out how to keep you down. <br><br>If you can leverage vendors, collaboration with people in the industry (with other companies, customers) in order to accelerate your career, then why not (so far as you are not breaking any rules ofcourse). The downside is that there is generally always jealousy and sometimes malicious jealousy which will sometimes try to sabotage your reputation, or relationships. Depriving them of information is a good way of protecting yourself. <br><br>So, if you find yourself doing all the right things, shaking all the right hands, making friends with industry leaders and people in influential positions as you should be, then you should be growing a little quicker than normal. Protect this support structure. Grow it. Grow people below you. Grow the person you report to (since it is always easier to receive support from someone that grows because of your growth) <br><br><br>In the end, remember; it is business. Friendships are cool, but I<sq>ve seen people throw friends under the bus when their confidence is low and their income is at risk. <br><br>Keep those relationships private from people you dont trust to have YOUR best interests in mind, do not boast about them etc. </p>",

Definitely a unique take on the front suspension of a motorcycle. <br><br>A few things though. <br><br>You come asking for advice on whether or not something is going to fail. You say you used some fancy software to design the geometry. I think all of that is great. You are taking the right steps to make sure you don<sq>t hurt yourself with your creation.<br><br>Then, you hear from many of us, of which most are engineers, that a few certain things are going to fail. First off, we feel they will fail either because we have experienced it before, or our knowledge of those devices tells us they fail in the way it is going to be loaded. <br><br>Then you get defensive saying they should hold just fine. But you have nothing to back up such claims. No Finite Element Analysis or even free body diagrams with mechanics of materials type calculations. You also got defensive and asked for a few user<sq>s details on their analysis. The short of that is that they did not do any. They do not have dimensions of anything. They don<sq>t know wall thicknesses of the steel tubing, they don<sq>t have a detailed diagram of this and how it works, most don<sq>t even know what they are looking at. So, they went with their gut to tell you it will probably fail. <br><br>Now, to answer your question on how to load test it when it<sq>s done<colon><br><br>Find a trailer. Find a vehicle scale, these are typically 4 load cells hooked up to on readout. Take one of these load cells, put it in the middle of the trailer. Put the front wheel of your motorcycle on the load cell. Strap down your motorcycle. You want the straps on the frame, near the front.  These straps should be the expensive ones. Not a cheap strap. Mostly because the ratcheting mechanism of the more expensive straps are far superior and easier to remove when done. Start ratcheting.<br><br>Something else you should know is what is called material fatigue. If you load a member over and over again, as is the case for the suspension of a motorcycle or car, it will not be able to take it<sq>s max load for very long.  The max load of a member being the yeild strength of the member. The point where more force will cause the member to fail. Example<colon> Member 1 can handle 1000lbs of force. That is it<sq>s yeild strength. Load it once to 1000lbs. It does fine. Load it 1000 times, it will not. Member 2 can handle 2000lbs of force. Load it 1000 times, it is fine. Load it 1e6 times, it is still fine. Load it 1e7 times, it fails. The amount of cycles a member can handle is based on what are called SN curves for fatigue. It is based on the material composition. Different materials handle fatigue differently. Iron/Steel handles it the best. Do you get this concept? If not ask me some questions on it. Or google it. <br><br>Now, lets talk about factor of safety. Member 1 has a safety factor(SF) or 1.0 for 1 cycle of loading. Member 2 has a SF of 1.0 for 1e7 cycles of loading. Now, lets consider Member 3. It is built to have a yield strength of 4,000lbs of force. It is possible that it may have a SF of 2.0 for 1e7 cycles. The SN curve will tell the real story. <br><br>The short of it is that the more cycles of force a member is subjected to, the stronger it has to be. SF of 2.0 is a decent place to start for your motorcycle. So, if you think 1,000lbs is the most force it will see when you ride it, you want to load it far past 2,000lbs, probably as high as 4,000lbs. It is at these points that your rod ends will fail in bending. </p>",

A coating which was more <sq>slippery<sq> if you will, would have a lower drag coefficient and allow the object to pass through the liquid faster. A hydrophobic coating doesn<sq>t create a forcefield around an object, rather it minimises the surface to liquid contact area so droplets can<sq>t stick to an object, and instead bead/slide off of it as seen [Here](http<colon>//www.adhesionbonding.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Hydrophilic-versus-Hydrophobic.png)<br><br>To answer your torpedo question, an object moving fast enough in water can cause cavitation, causing the water to vapourise momentarily. This reduces the drag on a torpedo as the forerunning point creates a slipstream of this vapourised water. In some torpedoes this has been designed for specifically and theoretically can create a full length capsule of air for the torpedo to carry through and this is known as super cavitation.<br><br>as mentioned above I am by no means an expert, just take an interest in these things so some terminology may be incorrect but it should be fundamentally okay for an explaination!</p>",

Its almost entirely useless when applied in hull coating application. Things to consider, in the example of water beading up, this really does not apply. A ship displaces a given volume of water based on its weight this allows it to float, and the volume corresponds to a wetted surface area.<br><br>Take a look at the resistance calculations for a hull. The largest parts are wave making drag and viscous drag. Viscous drag is calculated solely from wetted surface area and properties of the fluid, this has been done through flat plate testing in towing tanks and can be scaled up using an ITTC logarithmic trend line to get a full scale drag. I have somewhat got distracted but I guess the point is that viscous drag is only dependent on the length of the hull and the Reynolds number which is non dimensional and  based on velocity. Unless you can reduce wetted surface area you aren<sq>t reducing the viscous drag, and you aren<sq>t reducing the wetted surface area without changing some other parameter of the ship/torpedo/pool toy. <br><br>This is not even considering the fact that by repelling the fluid what would fill that gap? Air? Then you get very turbulent flow which is bad for viscous drag. </p>",

Also some problems put in <sq>distracting information<sq> which might not have to deal with at all to get the right answer.<br><br>Here<sq>s my thinking for each problem<colon><br><br>Problem 14<colon> Point Y moves to X and that distance looks about the same as each of the points beyond Z. Imagine pulling or pushing on Z and how the thing would move--they all open and close the same. It<sq>s like a scissor lift turned sideways if you<sq>ve seen one of those in operation. So, if Y opens to the right an additional step, Z will have to move an additional step just for point Y--that<sq>s answer A. Z will open up the same amount too--a second step to point B which is answer B so means A isn<sq>t the answer. But then the two linkages in the middle open up a step each as well, so it can<sq>t be B either. Four linkages each opening a step would move Z four steps and the other possible answer is point D which is four steps beyond. So I<sq>d select C after having crossed off A and B.<br><br>Problem 15<colon> Because it<sq>s a rigid structure the length of the connections between each of the hinges or pin points always stays the same length. This means no matter the angle of the beams the two hinges on Bar A will always be the same distance from the center post which means the vertical part of Bar A will always stay parallel to the center post and points A-B will always be horizontal. [Here<sq>s a video.](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypbof1hXPLg) So the answer is C.<br><br>Problem 16<colon> Imagine what the cross section through where the rope is looks like. It<sq>s a pulley problem where the pulleys are changing size. Imagine looking at them from the big end of Drum A, Drum A is pulling the rope up and to the right so it<sq>s spinning counterclockwise. Having the rope pulled off of B upwards and to the right, it<sq>ll spin clockwise. A pair of pulleys where the rope crosses over between them or any pair of gears always spins opposite. Ok, now the answers, A is both spin same direction, B is same direction, and C is opposite directions. You can eliminate A and B right off the bat from that leaving only C and you didn<sq>t even have to think about whether the speed is changing.<br><br>Problem 17<colon> that lever system is crazy and not practical at all. Ok, a lever swaps distance with force. The long arm has to move a lot farther but the force is much less. The short end multiplies the force but doesn<sq>t move very much. With system B, I can<sq>t imagine it moving at all but all the levers are short to long ends, they<sq>re all going in the same direction so it doesn<sq>t look like they<sq>re trying to trick you. Because of this, each step back from the load in system B will have a smaller and smaller force but have to move more and more distance. They also don<sq>t give you any numbers so the problem isn<sq>t going to be based on some subtlety or an answer where the one works out to be like 49 and the other is like 50 of something. Let<sq>s say the lever in A is 10 units long and 1 unit is on the load side so you<sq>d have an advantage of 9 (the load would feel 1/9th as heavy) while the levers in B are like a third as much so 3 each. The first lever connection from the load would be 1/3 the load. The middle lever would have a starting <dq>load<dq> of 1/3 the real load and then an effect of 3 so the 2nd connection would have a starting load of 1/9th and the lever effect of 3 again on that 1/9th would be 1/27th the load at point 2. Based on this I<sq>d pick answer A that the force applied will be greater on system A than B.<br><br>And Problem 18, because the force of 2 is much less than 1, point 2 will have to move a much larger distance so I<sq>d answer B.<br><br>Problem 13--as the wheel turns slider B only moves side to side and A moves up and down from slider B. My first impression is that the answer will be 2 or 4 because circle stuff along with sliders are only side to side or up and down so usually either 1 or 2<sq>s and there are only two things in series so 2x2 is the biggest that could be. The possible answers are 4, 8, or 16 so I<sq>d guess its 4.<br><br>The wheel will pull it B the left and then push it to the right with each turn. So B reverses twice per revolution. Slider A can only move up and down and it will always be a fixed distance from B. When B is in the center directly over A, A will be pushed down as far as possible. Then as B slides to either side the linkage will start pulling A up. Ok, so when B is at the left end of its path, A will be pulled up all the way. As B starts to move to the right A slides down and reaches its lowest point when B is directly above A. Then as B passes over to the right side, A reverses and starts to get pulled up and then it reaches its highest point when B is all the way to the right, then B starts sliding to the left and A reverses again to start going down. So I<sq>d say A reverses twice with each of B<sq>s strokes. B has two strokes for each revolution, so I<sq>d say 4 is the answer. If A were under one of the ends of B<sq>s stroke, then it<sq>d only reverse once with each stroke and the answer would be 2 but that isn<sq>t an option.</p>",

Simple control blocks (like an FSM), data structures (FIFOs, register files, etc.), math blocks (adders, multipliers, etc.), and even more complicated functions (signal processing blocks will do things filter, convulate, etc.) Those functions can be combined together to make entire blocks.

Shocks in the compression stages could also damage the turbine, but I<sq>m not sure how fast you<sq>d need to be going before oblique shocks can reach that far. Ramjets, on the other hand, rely on these shock waves to produce the compression needed for combustion - therefore they aren<sq>t so great at subsonic speeds, but work great at supersonic speeds. An afterburner is basically just a ramjet put on the back of a turbojet. The two might work outside of their respective regimes (I.E will combust fuel), but they aren<sq>t going to be very efficient at it.<br><br>The big reason why afterburners are more common (or rather that a single engine design is uncommon) basically comes down to the fact that designing a single engine that works well at low subsonic, high subsonic, sonic, and supersonic regimes is difficult simply due to the physics involved. They found a way to do so - and I don<sq>t doubt that it<sq>s classified, so it would really be a shot in the dark on my part to guess how.</p>",

Only recently, were techniques developed to allow inlet turbine temperatures high enough and compressors designs efficient enough to do impart enough energy to the fluid to allow for supercruise.  Afterburner were a way to put more energy into the fluid, but is much less efficient due to the pressure loss after the turbine (think Brayton cycle).<br><br>This also goes explains why the engine in the F-22, and most other high speed planes, are low bypass turbofans.  The fan blades at the front of the engine are not designed to handle strong shocks.  For example, a passenger plane like the 737 has high bypass engines and travels around Mach 0.82.  The limiting factor for the fan in the front is the inlet speed and the rotational speed.  The velocity of fluid at the tip of the fan should not exceed the transonic flow speeds.<br><br>Thus, inlet duct design is very important.  Basically the inlet of a supersonic low bypass turbofan is designed to reduce the flow speed to the fan and not let the oblique shocks coming from the inlet reach the turbine during supersonic flight.  What is interesting to me is the inlet of the F-22 is not variable, which limits its top speed due to choking.<br><br>If you are asking what technologies have lead up to this, there are many.  Here are a few off the top of my head.<br><br>* Material advancements<br>* Endwall Contouring<br>* Advanced cooling<br>* Blade tip treatments<br>* Higher turbine inlet temperatures<br>* CFD<br>* Parametric design<br>* Components with less mass ([Blisk](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blisk))<br></p>",

Presumably the only areas where you want to have light are the ones where you need it for scenic/psychological reasons, or want to grow plants, or want to have direct interaction with the sea.<br><br>To deal with the pressure buckyballs, as mentioned, of some kind are probably the best deal. They have the added benefit of covering the largest volume with the smallest outside area, being round. In addition they give a snazzy modernist look to the whole endeavour. I<sq>d stick with a standard ball shape for safety and maximum predictability. Obviously they need to be anchored in many redundant ways. I<sq>d still add wavebreaking structures around it all though, but those only need to be tough. Piles of rocks could suffice, but if you can move them so can a big storm.<br><br>In the rock you would still work with a network of caves and sluices with multiple connections, so you can seal off areas where flooding happens and still get around. It<sq>s probably the best not to rely on the rock (if only for earthquake danger), so you<sq>d use it as structural support for the same buckyballs used higher. The rock is most likely sedimentary, if it<sq>s there at all, so mining probably isn<sq>t going to happen much, and geothermal opportunities are highly place-dependent.<br><br>**Leaks**. I<sq>d solve that by doubling the bucky ball structure, effectively nesting one ball in another, so you get an insulating layer. You need pumps in it to pressurize or depressurize it with both air and water. As long as the pressure is high there (with anything), you<sq>re leaking towards the outside instead of towards the inside, which is much more comfortable than the other way around. If the air pressure is high you can easily detect leaks on the outside. When water leaks into it, you can pump it out without too much hassle. Assuming you have geothermal opportunities on site, the excess warm water can serve as a kind of central heating in the outer layer. It<sq>s even better if you can add a third ball, so you can alternate sea-air-warmwater-inside layers for flexibility and safety.<br><br>**Connections**. Loose wires between separate compounds to guide transports of goods. You can leave them slack when not needed so they are unaffected by changing tensions in and between the structures. You<sq>d need some kind of diving bell setup in each ball as a harbor/docking place. Walkways are rather something for inside the rock, not out in the open.<br><br>**Breathing**. The surface is not that far, but assuming we want some kind of independence from the atmosphere, most of the light area will have greenery of some kind. That<sq>s not enough. An osmotic interface with the ocean water that allows oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass through would solve the production, but will most likely still require some circulation aid. If we<sq>re doing it the old-fashioned industrial brute force way, oxygen is produced by breaking up water molecules, spending lots of energy, and circulated in the structure. That has the disadvantage that the collected carbon dioxide can be used to air the kelp farms, or algae cultures, so they<sq>ll grow better.<br><br>**Food**<colon> Neptune<sq>s bounty. Perhaps the local sea floor offers some kelp opportunities... In any case, the cost of importing food will be absolutely minimal compared with the cost of all the infrastructure, so if you can pay for that you<sq>ve got centuries to perfect this one.<br><br>**People**<colon> I recommend kindly asking Japanese, given that they<sq>re smaller so they take up less space, are used to lots of fish and seaweed, and are used to both stresses of highly populated areas and executing the many rules and safety procedures needed to keep the place from flooding. <br><br>Good luck!

                "answer": "<p>It took me some time, but I was quite fortunate with the way my first employer treated me.  I was with the company for 8+ years, and then I decided to move from the east coast to Colorado. I sold my house, and made some money doing so, and that gave me the courage to quit (when I say <dq>made some money<dq> I mean I had about 1 years salary in the bank, with all my bills paid; obviously not something that everyone can do, and I<sq>m not sure I<sq>d be able to do it again).  But with that, I told my boss I was leaving, and suddenly, I became the most valuable thing they had.  I told them that I didn<sq>t have a job where I was moving, but I said it wasn<sq>t a problem.  They offered to let me work remotely.  Suddenly, all the little projects that I had wanted to do, but never had the time, the company thought was worth paying me to do from my home office in my new house.  So they let me work remotely for 3 months, and probably would have let me work longer if I needed it, but along came a job offer for a job that I was perfectly suited for.  When the new company approached me, I went in for an interview, ended up staying most of the day, and by the end, I was with the two bosses telling them what my salary should be.  A week later, I got an offer for more than I asked for.  I worked up to the friday before labor day last year, and started work with the new company the wednesday after.  <br><br>So that got a bit long, but what I took away from this was not to force things.  If you have the ability, really work on your plan and setting things up for your transition.  Don<sq>t try to pick a deadline, but pick milestones.  For my wife and I, it was either sell the house, or for one of us to get a new job.  The house sold first, so we were free to search for new jobs.  If you<sq>re not moving, it<sq>s probably easier, but for me at my old position, I was working at pretty much the only employer in the field I worked in in the area, so if I was changing jobs, I had to move (or start commuting a long distance).  <br><br>Change is never easy, but I am quite happy with my decision.  My old job was very structured, and my new job isn<sq>t.  I thought that was going to be great, but there are some nice things about working in a structured environment that I miss.  Also, I went from being near the top engineer in my group (well, below my manager, but I had spent the previous year training 4 new engineers simultaneously, and otherwise, I worked with some draftsmen) to being the only engineer, so I miss the ability to talk about the engineering issues I<sq>m working on with other people working on similar types of problems.  So while I am happier with my new place in life, not every blade of grass is greener.  <br><br>The other thing, if a move is part of your job search, I found that nobody was interested in paying for relocation for me, but once I was local, I got a lot of interest.  <br><br>Good luck!</p>",

It is time we have new urinals. <br><br>I don<sq>t like the fact that some people on here are laughing at the OP for not knowing how to pee into a urinal with minimal splash. Of course he knows how to pee in a freaking urinal, he<sq>s posting in askengineers. But as any good engineer should know, the burden is not for a consumer to figure out how to use a product, rather the burden is for the engineer to *design* the product well. Current urinal design is bad, no doubt about it. There exist 90 degree max-splash angles, so inevitably people who don<sq>t give a fuck will splash piss all over their shoes and floors. This is bad design - we should just get rid of this possibility all together. <br><br>The best idea is probably some sort of cone facing upward, researched so that the angle most people pee into it will be met with a nice clean 10 degree gradient, affording no splashback. Use some cheap super-hydrophobic material lining too, so you can minimize cleaning. They exist, trust me, hospitals use them on their machines all the time. Finally you<sq>ll have to figure out whether or not you need flushing - if you can design it like those waterless toilets that don<sq>t need flushing, then you have a real fucking winner in your hands.<br><br>Okay, now you have a great product, next step is market penetration. You can<sq>t just go to BKs and airports and say <dq>Yo, I have a better urinal<dq>, because they<sq>re going to say <dq>We already have urinals, why would we want to spend money to switch<dq>. You can<sq>t sell shit like that. You have to explain that it will save them money in the long run. <br><br>Here<sq>s a good case study - in Boston we recently got these solar cell powered trash compactors. At first I was like, solar cells on trash? The green energy movement has gone too far, this really isn<sq>t helping the environment. But then I thought about it - if you have trash being compacted regularly, you only have to pick up trash 1/5th of the time. Garbagemen are probably the greatest cost for garbage companies, so if you can reduce that, well that<sq>s much better economically!<br><br>So you gotta sell it that your zero-piss toilet will reduce splash by 95<percent>, which will save you bathroom cleaning time from your janitors forever, meaning less janitor work-hours and more time they can spend on cleaning more important things. <br><br>Everyone else, this is the next big thing.

We use thermodynamics to characterize the engine performance. Spark ignition gasoline engines run on the Otto cycle, compression ignition Diesel engines on the Diesel cycle. <br><br>Intake/Exhaust Manifold<colon><br>We have air being drawn into the engine. So, we need to know how to model fluid flow pressure drops through pipe using ~~Bernoulli~~ *Navier Stokes* equations in order to determine how large of a pipe to use. <br><br>Fuel system<colon><br>We have fuel being injected into the air stream. So, we need to know how to model fluid flow pressure drops through a pipe using ~~Bernoulli~~ *Navier Stokes* equations in order to determine how large of a pipe to use as well as figure out how thick the make the walls of the pipe so it doesn<sq>t explode, we use hoop stress to figure this guy out. <br><br>Cylinders/Pistons<colon><br>When the air/fuel mixture ignites, it raises the pressure significantly. This puts a lot of stress on the materials in the cylinder, like the piston, the connecting rod, and the crankshaft. It puts a large compression force on the connecting rod, so we need to make sure it doesn<sq>t buckle under force. We take material choice and cross-sectional area into account here. We also look at S/N curves here because material fatigue is a huge problem you must consider when designing something that will experience the same stresses millions of times over it<sq>s lifetime. We will also get into a little bit of fuel chemistry as well to determine how much heat the fuels will give off when burned in the cylinder. The amount of fuel in the cylinder determines how hot it gets at Top Dead Center(TDC) and therefore what the pressure is at that point. We also know that air/fuel mixtures burn at a specific rate based on the air properties. We use that to decide when to fire the spark plug.  There are properties of air specific to flow in a cylinder called squish, swirl, and tumble that will change the rate at which the air/fuel mixture burns, these change with increased engine speed, so we may also need to change the spark plug timing as the engine speed rises.<br><br>Crankshaft<colon><br>The pistons push on the connecting rod which pushes on the crankshaft. We turn linear motion into rotational motion. We have large bending moments on the crankshaft, so lots of shear stresses due to bending. Again, we look at S/N curves here because material fatigue. The crankshaft is connected to various gears as well an output shaft. Those gears have teeth on them. We figure out the stresses within the gear to determine things like the width of the gear teeth, the spacing, and so on. <br><br>Engine block<colon><br>Remember how I said the air/fuel mixture is burning and releases a lot of heat? Well, we need to know how much of it because it makes things hot. We move heat away from the cylinders so they don<sq>t weaken due to temperature rises(jet fuel can<sq>t melt steel beams, remember? but it can weaken them a lot). So, we again need to know how to model fluid pressure drops. We also need to know how to model temperature distributions and heat transfer in materials and fluids in order to properly move heat away from the engine. We also need to know how to model friction in viscous fluids so we can effectively pump oil all through the engine and so we can also determine how thick to make many cross-sections in the engine block so it can hold the crank shaft and cylinders in place and doesn<sq>t come apart under load. <br><br>Basically, first we model forces. You can do that. It<sq>s easy. Them we look at our constraints. We may only have X^3 area to work around in order to make something that will stand up to those forces. So we go through trade offs in choosing a material and a geometry that will satisfy the applied forces. Different geometries garner different methods of manufacture, as do different materials. If it<sq>s steel, it<sq>s going to be cast or machined. Aluminum will be cast, machined, or injection molded. Plastics will be machined or injection molded.<br><br>Things like that. **Ya know, things that are practical and useful.** We don<sq>t get stuck in theory because it just doesn<sq>t matter. Knowing the derivations of the Bernoulli or Navier Stokes equations doesn<sq>t always help us solve the problems we were tasked with. <br><br>EDIT<colon> Thanks for the correction on flow equations /u/lepriccon22.

I do a week of afternoons, a week of midnights, a relief/wildcard week, then 3 weeks of days (one on shift, one on training, the rest is time off).<br><br>I<sq>ve learned how to pretty sleep on command when I need to, how to sleep when I don<sq>t feel tired, but it<sq>s still a bit taxing.<br><br>Going from days to afternoons isn<sq>t too bad. Going to midnights is challenging. Typically the second night is the absolute worst, so I personally will stay up until 7 AM the two nights between afternoon shift and midnight shift, so that my first night of work is really night 3 for me. If I don<sq>t get enough sleep it can be pretty taxing, but I<sq>m better at it now. It essentially wastes those two days off for me though, because I<sq>m sleeping all day or I<sq>m tired and grumpy, but it makes me much safer to drive home after the first night of work.<br><br>Coming off midnight shift is *hard*. If any family activities are going on, I just fall asleep randomly or am grumpy. For a few days I wake up randomly at 2 or 3 AM and can<sq>t get back to sleep. I<sq>ll fall asleep at 4 PM sometimes and have to get woken up so I don<sq>t regress onto nights.<br><br>During the midnight part of the rotation, I notice I start falling asleep later and later. It<sq>s not an issue unless I have a 12 hour shift scheduled near the end of the midnight rotation. I<sq>m not sure why I end up staying up, it<sq>s just a natural effect of adapting to the schedule, getting caught up on sleep, and what daylight can do.<br><br>You lose track of time on the afternoon and midnight shift weeks. I have to really focus on what day it is, especially if I have mixed 8 and 12 hour shifts in a week and/or I<sq>m working up to 7-8 days straight. <br><br>It<sq>s hard on family. On afternoon shift, you can<sq>t see your kids if they are in school. On 12 hour day shift, you don<sq>t see your kids if they go to sleep early (my toddler sleeps at 7-8 pm so I don<sq>t see her). On midnights I really can<sq>t help much around the house, and my wife feels pretty abandoned on the weekends. <br><br>It<sq>s not easy. It needs to be financially worthwhile or something you are really motivated for or a good career move (really some combination of above). <br><br>Night shift has less oversight. You get more stuff done usually. It<sq>s a more chill pace usually (except Monday morning where you are scrambling to get stuff tagged out for the work week). I actually like being at work on nights, especially during a refuel outage.<br><br>Being on call is sucky/frustrating. I had to do it in systems engineering. No drinking or leaving the area. Plus until I get a couple days into the night shift, I<sq>m a dangerous driver. I<sq>ve been called in at 8PM to stay until 8AM after I was already up at 5AM that morning, and coming home was scary. I won<sq>t do that anymore, I<sq>ll grab a hotel a few miles from work rather than take the expressway or something if that happens. <br><br>Like all things, if you can deal with the sacrifice, you can manage through it. The rotation I<sq>m on now isn<sq>t that bad, it just has a few challenges you learn to live with.

The big appliances such as central air conditioners, electric water heaters, electric dryers, electric ranges will use the two black cables to get double the power.  <br>  <br>Black is called <dq>hot<dq>  <br>White is called <dq>neutral<dq>  <br>  <br>[Black1 - White] = 110V Phase 1 - Half of the outlets  <br>[Black2 - White] = 110V Phase 2 - Other half of the outlets  <br>[Black1 - Black2] = 220V - Big appliances.  <br>  <br>If one of the black cables is cut or damaged or disconnected by a breaker, then you will lose half of the outlets along with the big appliances.  If the other black cable is disconnected, then you will lose the other half of the outlets.  If the white cable is disconnected, you will lose all outlets, but some of the big appliances might still work.  <br>  <br>Normally, the main circuit breakers are designed to disconnect both black cables if there is a power surge or electrical problem, which will power down everything.  It is very rare that just one black cable gets disconnected.  <br>   <br>You can see the cables in [this image.](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/72XwjAl.png)  The 3 thick wires at the top (black, black, and white) are coming from the power company.

Computers fascinated me from the time our family got our first computer.  I spent hours learning about them and learning how they worked.  I wanted to use these awesome machines forever.  Along the way I realized I enjoyed the hardware much more than the software and wanted to build computers to solve problems.<br><br>* What\u2019s a normal day like at work for you? Can you describe your daily tasks?<br>I am a field engineer for an aircraft fleet.  I am responsible for everything from power generation, navigation, radios, onboard systems, and even some ground systems such as ground power.  My day involves several varying tasks depending on what is going on with the aircraft.  My main responsibility is fixing a problem that the normal maintenance employees cannot fix due to missing or inadequate instructions or technical data.  Secondary responsibilities include testing and integrating new electronics into the aircraft.  Other things include a lot of interfacing between the buyers, makers, and sellers of the equipment we use to provide feedback, requested/required information, or interpretation of data to make maintaining the electrical portions of the aircraft easier, more cost effective, more streamlined.  Inadequate communication for requirements or interfaces is a HUGE problem that requires constant attention.  The best part about my job is that I have no idea what I will be doing from day to day.  Each day brings new and interesting challenges.<br><br>* What school did you attend, and why should I go there?<br>I attended the University of Oklahoma.  The school focuses very much on meteorological uses of electrical equipment.  Specifically weather radar for storm prediction and modelling.  They use several unique setups with the National Weather Service to expand and enhance the ability to predict, track, and model severe storm behavior.  Digital signal processing and embedded technologies for sensor arrays and radar signal processing.  The school is also big into energy production sectors of research, so the electrical counterpart to an energy company funding research.<br><br>* What\u2019s your favorite project you worked on in college or during your career?<br>My favorite project in school was my capstone project.  I designed the ability to interface and use any device for traffic monitoring on a highway system over the internet.  My specific device was a camera that was remotely controlled through an interface over the internet.  The actual camera was only controlled through a serial interface and the initial project description asked me to design an ethernet to serial converter for controlling only this specific device.  Instead, by utilizing a database of  serial instructions assigned to a device, i was able to create an application that allowed you to select a device from a database which then supplied the control data for that device and address to the device, then control that device across the internet. This allowed scalability for this application for highway flow monitoring.<br>My favorite work project is saving an aircraft after it being buried in 30 feet of fire suppressant that accidentally discharged.  I literally had to take the information I had as guidelines for this type of event and throw it away.  I had to return to basic design guidelines and chemistry of the suppressant to determine if this aircraft could be saved and how to do it.<br><br>* If you could do it all over again, would you do anything differently?<br>I would have paid more attention during my first two years of college.  I never had to struggle in high school for anything.  I did not adjust well to college at first because doing homework and studying is REQUIRED, but I did not know how to study and did not have the self discipline to do homework.  I failed out of the university on my first try and ended up with an Associates Degree in Computer Science before I had my head on straight enough to attempt the 4 year degree again.<br><br>* Do you have any advice for someone who<sq>s just getting started in engineering school/work?<br>For those starting school, in order of importance<colon>  Do your homework.  Do not be afraid to ask your professor during office hours, they are there to help you, but do not know you need help unless YOU ask.  All the cool projects are in clubs, not in class.  I didn<sq>t do clubs until my last couple of years and I wish someone had told me when I started that the really fun stuff is in the clubs, not in the classes. Lastly, SPELLING AND GRAMMAR ARE IMPORTANT!  It does not matter if you can do all the math if you cannot tell anyone what you did, why it<sq>s important, or how to do it themselves.<br>For those starting work<colon> Be patient, not everyone finds their magic job right off the bat.  My first job was terrible, all meetings and no engineering.  I got very depressed before I realized it was the job causing the problem.  Keep your work/life balance in balance.  Neglecting your health and family for work does not pay off at all.  If you need to find a new job, there is nothing stopping anyone from looking.  Keep looking even when the answer might be no.  It will eventually be yes.  Lastly, do not be afraid of new challenges.  They are what help you grow as a person and engineer.</p>",

If there are no immediate things which require my attention, I will proceed into the lab to continue working on planned activities. I will take maybe 30-45 minutes for lunch.

It was relatively inexpensive. It took me far longer than 4 years to graduate with a BSEE but by juggling studies with 2 part-time jobs I was able to avoid taking any student loans and I gained a huge amount of valuable internship work experience which gave me an edge when looking for my 1st job.

I loved electronics, pulling apart computers and finding out how things worked. Electricity always fascinated me as well; It was this crazy invisible source of power that caused things to happen; I was also awed as to how humans could control and harness this energy source safely to benefit people in society.<br><br>* **Why did you choose your field and/or specialization?** Australia was in the midst of a resources boom and companies were screaming out for power systems engineers. There were new infrastructure projects all over the country and many new high voltage installations were built to service the projects. I loved getting to play with the *real* big machines ;ie large power station generators, 500kV transmission lines, switching high voltage etc etc. However on top of the demand for power engineers, I also saw the importance that energy has in society. There is change on the horizon for how we source and consume our energy. I am looking forward to what the next 50 years has to offer.<br><br>* **What\u2019s a normal day like at work for you? Can you describe your daily tasks?** Ok, so I am a Power Systems and Protection Engineer. What this means is I design, construct, test and maintain large, high voltage power systems; I also specialise in protecting these power systems as they can sometimes explode... High Voltage is pretty dam cool but it can also be very dangerous when stuff goes wrong, as this video will show you. https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX5TIDLvMyw So I am employed to not only design high voltage systems; I also get paid to protect them. The last job I was on was for a very large facility. I was required to design and test all of their protection devices to make sure if there was an electrical fault, that it wouldn<sq>t explode and cause a fire. Engineers like me use protection relays to protect the power system. These relays are microprocessor computers that monitor the voltage and current on the equipment. I do a lot of maths to work out what an abnormal system looks like and I program the relay to look for these conditions.

The biggest challenge is ensuring you set the protection relays correctly. If you don<sq>t set them correctly, the fault will cause an explosion or possibly hurt somebody. Once I finish programming the relays, I then inject voltage and current into them at set amounts to make sure they operate correctly and in the time they are meant to.

Digital circuit design these days is essentially writing code like a software engineer.  You can put billions of transistors on a chip because you write a lot of code and then the design tools put the transistors where they need to be.  Analog design is a significantly smaller scale (maybe hundreds to thousands number of transistors on a chip) but each one has to be customized to work properly.  I got into image sensors by chance, but its a hot topic now and there is a lot of work being down now in the field.  Everything has a camera these days.<br><br>* What\u2019s a normal day like at work for you? Can you describe your daily tasks?<br>My three main tasks are circuit design (50<percent>), circuit layout (25<percent>), and test/characterization (25<percent>).  Though it goes in phases, so it would be say 50 days of circuit design, 25 days of layout, (then 2-3 months later) 25 days of test.  Circuit design is putting together the schematics at a transistor level, and running many many simulations to make sure everything works correctly.  We have software and models that predict how the circuit works, and generally do a good job of it.  Circuit layout is taking that circuit and actually <dq>drawing<dq> how the transistors and connections to the transistors would look on the actual chip.  The semiconductor fab uses these drawings to actually fabricate the chip (which is the 2-3 month wait).  Test is taking your chip to the lab, building a test system for it, and making sure everything you simulated with the software works the way it should.  Built into those three things are competitor research, reading technical papers, debugging and problem solving, writing datasheets..<br><br>* What school did you attend, and why should I go there?<br>UCSB undergrad, ASU masters.  I think UCSB is the perfect balance of a great education and a great college experience.  They had a few nobel prize winners right before i went there, and they put emphasis on getting through in 4 years.  I had other colleges say that almost nobody gets through in 4 years.  People are generally a good combination of fun and smart.  And its right on the beach <colon>)<br><br>* What\u2019s your favorite project you worked on in college or during your career?<br>Developing cameras that will be used in space.  You have to make sure everything is close to perfect, because once it flies, its gone forever and you can<sq>t fix it.  Image sensors are very specific to the application they will be used in.  Your cell phone, your go pro, hd cameras for film, cameras for satellites, cameras for automobiles, cameras for machine vision, etc..are all essentially custom designs for that application.  <br><br>* If you could do it all over again, would you do anything differently?<br>Probably would have studied more regularly instead of cramming for tests.  I think i would have retained more information that way.<br><br>* Do you have any advice for someone who<sq>s just getting started in engineering school/work?<br>Don<sq>t get discouraged by people saying its too hard.  It is hard, but if you are willing to put in the time you will get through it.  </p>",

Imagine a smooth metal riding on smooth metal. It would be fairly easy to slide them across one another, now if you took a bunch of weight it would get harder and harder to slide.
