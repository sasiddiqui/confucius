(Though ok it<sq>s not *as* socially progressive as Scandinavia and it is still quite small in terms of population)<br><br>* a counterexample in the opposite direction might be Japan or South Korea, which are both very ethnically/culturally homogeneous but also tend to have somewhat regressive attitudes in some ways... people sometimes use these countries to argue the exact opposite<colon> that homogeneity allows a stronger sense of <dq>tradition<dq> and doesn<sq>t create the same push for <dq>progressive<dq> policies (as a hypothetical example if 99<percent> of your population is the same religion, who<sq>s going to fight for religious tolerance or a secularized state?)<br><br>* [here is a map](http<colon>//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File<colon>Countries_by_immigrant_population.svg) of immigrant population by country.

You can see that the US does have markedly higher income inequality than Scandinavia. But this also demonstrates that income inequality and racial diversity don<sq>t necessarily correlate. Which is why we<sq>d really need to define which one we mean in order to really answer this question.<br><br>* The main difficulty with this question I think will be separating cause and effect. Unless you want to define homogeneity *strictly* on racial terms, it<sq>s going to be hard to figure out causality. Class inequality and the strength of the welfare state are the obvious example. Was it easier to implement a generous welfare state because the population was economically homogeneous? Or is the population economically homogeneous because of the generous welfare state? This obviously doesn<sq>t apply only to economic inequality either... the reason that there is still a distinct black culture in America after 200+ years is obviously that regressive social policies in the form of institutionalized racism kept blacks and whites deliberately separated.<br> </p>",

In fact they argue that about half of all economic goods are produced in noncapitalist means--including communist, socialist, feudalistic, slave-based forms. However, we always see this economic diversity as less than capitalist economy. Further, these types of economic processes are all interconnected--capitalism depends of socialism and socialism on capitalism. For example, feminist economists have demonstrated that household production of goods and services can be produced in a number of ways--ranging from a socialist formation to a highly feudal one. The capitalist economy depends on these non-capitalist processes.

What they argue, and what I largely agree with, is that rather than trying to install socialism in a one-shot-revolutionary-hail-Mary, it is important to catalogue economic difference as it currently exists and to then seek to work in and with communities to envision less or non-exploitative ways of creating and distributing surplus labor.

On a micro-scale, such as in a local food co-op, it works either or both through a fee or labor, and it<sq>s usually voluntary. Co-ops are often very small, but they can be as large as [Waitrose](http<colon>//education.victoria.coop/index.php/articles/publications/506-jlw), worth millions of dollars and basically Britain<sq>s answer to Trader Joe<sq>s. They can work, but aren<sq>t guaranteed to work since they require a lot of active cooperation. <br><br>As for criticisms? The US is fairly unique as a society, in that it<sq>s the only democracy (at least that I can think of) in which large numbers of people decry any socialist practices at all. Even the GOP<sq>s equivalent in the UK [doesn<sq>t dare badmouth their national healthcare system](http<colon>//www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Health.aspx). In the US, the objection seems to be a belief in a moral right not to contribute to society if one does not want to, and that the economic system works better with [no government involvement or regulation](http<colon>//folk.uio.no/daget/neoliberalism.pdf). And socialist systems in the real world often have a lot of bureaucracy, inefficiency and waste ([such as France](http<colon>//www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40354/The-growth-of-a-professional-bureaucracy)) in the form of a large public sector.<br><br>Sources<colon> [1](http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/opinion/20iht-edzimmermann.html?_r=0) [2](http<colon>//www8.georgetown.edu/centers/cdacs/bermanpaper.pdf) [3](http<colon>//bus.lsbu.ac.uk/resources/CIBS/european-institute-papers/papers1/296.PDF) <br><br>*The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought* <br><br>*The Primacy of Politics<colon> Social Democracy and the Making of Europe<sq>s Twentieth Century* <br><br>*International Relations* Goldstein/Pevehouse (5th edition)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The overall appearance of modern men<sq>s business attire hasn<sq>t changed all that much over the past century. What people think of as formal attire has, though. For example, take this picture of [Ataturk from the 20s](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File<colon>Atat<percent>C3<percent>BCrk_in_white_tie.jpg)<colon> this would be considered formal ([white tie, today](http<colon>//www.blacktieguide.com/Etiquette/Etiquette_Defining_White_Tie.htm)) evening attire. On the other hand, what we currently think of as formal or business attire was actually considered informal attire. This has largely lost traction in Western fashion, but can still be seen in [diplomatic etiquette](http<colon>//www.ediplomat.com/nd/protocol/dressing.htm), for example. So I would say there have been changes in the dividing lines between different types of attire, but the changes in the actual garments have been a bit slower as you observe.<br><br>This [Economist article](http<colon>//www.economist.com/node/17722802) mostly agrees with that train of thought. It goes back to the inception of the suit with less emphasis on the previous century, but does mention that <br><br>> By 1890 the American office worker wanted both the informality of the lounge suit, with its sporting heritage, and a snappy, modern and efficient look that its military antecedents gave it.<br><br>...which may go a long way in explaining where the current <dq>epoch<dq> of fashion kicked off. Additionally, they also agree that the suit hasn<sq>t changed much on the outside, but the interior has drastically changed\u2014pockets for tickets, pens, and phones are all examples.<br><br>On a final note, I don<sq>t really think our long collective memory is hindering radical changes; in my opinion, fashion has always been an iterative process with a few exceptions. The Economist article notes that one of the first big steps towards the suit happened when King Charles II ordered courtiers to <dq>dress in simple tunics, shirts and breeches<dq>. While this top down enforcement may happen occasionally (maybe you could draw comparisons to colonialism and the spread of Western attire?), things otherwise move pretty slowly.

We can partition that debt into four groups<colon><br><br>1. Debt held by the Federal Reserve (about $2 trillion)  [source](http<colon>//www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/h41.htm#h41tab1)<br>2. Debt held by foreign entities (about $5.5 trillion) [source](http<colon>//www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt)<br>3. Debt held within the government (about $5 trillion) [source](http<colon>//www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html)<br>4. Debt held by households, pension firms, and state & local governments (the rest, about $4.5 trillion)<br><br>I<sq>m pulling those numbers from a few sources, which you can look at. The foreign holdings comes from Treasury (July 2013); the Federal Reserve holdings comes from the Fed (October 2013), the intergovernmental holdings comes from the GAO (2011, so I<sq>ve interpolated) and the remainder is arithmetic. <br><br>Foreigners own about one-third of the debt, so only about two-thirds is owed <dq>to ourselves.<dq><br><br>Second, let<sq>s talk about the reasons US government debt is not like household debt.<br><br>1. US government debt is not the same as household debt, because there is *demand* for US debt. Individuals, firms, state & local governments, and foreign entities buy US government debt as a safe asset. Nobody flocks to your door to purchase <dq>/u/integralds debt instruments<dq> or <dq>/u/fortif debt instruments,<dq> but people *do* flock to [Treasury auctions](http<colon>//www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed41.html).<br><br>  [Edit<colon> I<sq>m getting 9,001 types of pushback on this. Let me simplify massively by saying that any given individual household<sq>s debt (which is what we<sq>re talking about) is a perfect substitute for other households<sq> debt. No lender really cares about which individual households they own assets from. By contrast, US Treasuries play a special role on many players<sq> balance sheets. That<sq>s the difference I was getting at here. Read it in the context of the entire post, and see the various edits scattered about.]<br><br>2. So there<sq>s demand for US debt. But there<sq>s also demand for corporate debt (commercial paper). Google [sells debt](http<colon>//blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2010/07/15/google-announces-3-billion-commercial-paper-program/), just like the US Treasury. So what distinguishes US government debt from other kinds of in-demand debt instruments? The US government issues debt denominated in US dollars. In addition, the US government (via the Fed) is able to *print* US dollars. <br><br>  That is, the US government issues debt denominated in a currency that it also issues. That<sq>s nontrivial, because it means that in a worst-case scenario the US government can always print currency to pay back its debts. There is no reason *in principle* that the US should default.  Yes, paying off debt with newly-minted currency (called <dq>monetizing the debt<dq>) likely leads to a loss of confidence, inflation, and other bad outcomes; it is a worst-case scenario, but it does matter. <br><br>3. Caveat<colon> #2 leads me to the recent debt ceiling/default issue. There are other things going on here. The Fed is independent of the rest of the government *precisely so* it doesn<sq>t print money to pay back US debt. Yes, that means #2 is less of a factor than it otherwise would be, but #2 continues to run rampant in popular accounts of <dq>why government debt is different.<dq> So you have reason to think #2 is *not* the main thing going on here, regardless of what you might see in /r/politics.<br><br>4. So the fact that the US prints debt in its own currency should be discounted due to the independence of the Fed. Why else is government debt different from commercial paper? The government is a large player in the economy and has noticeable effects on aggregate demand. Individual households and firms do not have that luxury. What *that* means is that, for you, interest rates are givens; for governments, interest rates are something that can vary depending on how much the government itself spends.<br><br>  To speak in jargon for a second, households exist in partial equilibrium while governments exist in general equilibrium. That<sq>s the basic reason that the government is *not* a household and why government debt is *not* like household debt. When times are bad, and the government borrows in order to stimulate the economy, it<sq>s possible for output to rise and for, on net, debt/GDP to fall. (Though I don<sq>t really want to talk about stabilization policy, and especially fiscal stabilization policy, unless someone forces me to. Let<sq>s focus on longer-run issues first, they<sq>re less controversial.)<br><br>Third, a few small notes.<br><br>1. Given the fact that there is serious demand for US debt, the optimal level of debt is most likely positive, not zero. Continued demand for US debt also implies that the government can indeed run deficits, even in the long run. <br>2. The proper variable to look at is the debt-to-GDP ratio or, even better, the interest-payments-to-GDP ratio, or even the interest-payments-to-government-revenues ratio, along with the likely future trajectories of those objects. This measures the <dq>sustainable<dq> increase in the debt each year, in a broad sense.<br>3. The single driver of the US government deficits over the next two decades is medical payments. [Source](http<colon>//www.cbo.gov/publication/44521)<br>4. Cutting defense spending is not going to help. Defense spending is about 4<percent> of GDP. We could cut it to, say, 3<percent> of GDP, and that would temporarily improve the buget outlook. However, cutting defense does **nothing** to stop medical care expenditures from eating a growing portion of revenues and GDP.<br>5. Cutting social security doesn<sq>t help either, for the same reasons. Social Security will rise from 4<percent> to about 6<percent> of GDP after the baby boomers are done retiring, then will stabilize. Social Security could use some reforms, perhaps bringing it to 5<percent> of GDP in line with social security taxes, but again the elephant in the room is medical care and medical care alone.<br>6.

Any given individual is a tiny part of any MBS or other household debt instrument, and **no individual can affect the price (interest rate) on those securities.** By contrast, the government as a single entity can affect the interest rate on its debt instruments by manipulating their supply. The key is partial vs general equilibrium - that is, the key is how interest rates respond to the  actions of a single actor (your tiny household, the large government)<br><br>  I<sq>m going to continue to get pushback here, so I know I<sq>m going to have to revisit this point multiple times.

                "answer": "<p>One thing that hasn<sq>t been mentioned here is that the bombing in Ankara was the third in an escalating bombing campaign (the work of [the same cell based originally out of the Adiyaman province](http<colon>//www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-15/ankara-bomber-traveled-public-path-to-turkey-s-deadliest-attack)).  For Turkish politics, the [Suru\u00e7 bombing](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Suru\u00e7_bombing) was actually more shocking. And even the Suru\u00e7 bombing was preceded by a bombing at [another pro-Kurdish nationalist, pro-Leftist political rally](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Diyarbak\u0131r_rally_bombings) a few months before.  These were all conducted, the consensus in the West is, by ISIS, even though no group has formally claimed responsibility for any of them. There were also two more mysterious recent bombings in Turkey, a [suicide bombing at an Istanbul police station](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Istanbul_suicide_bombing) (two dead, including the bomber) earlier this year and [cars bombs in the border town of Reyhanl\u0131](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyhanl\u0131_bombings) (52 dead) in 2013. The police station attack was claimed by the far left DHKP/C, but is still mysterious. The target (Turkish police in a tourist district) makes sense for the far left group, but the bomber was apparently a Chechen national, which makes it seem more like an Islamist group. But the target wouldn<sq>t really match targets ISIS has gone for in countries like Turkey. The Reyhanl\u0131 bombing is perhaps even more mysterious, with speculation that it could be anyone from Al Qaeda in Syria or ISIS to Syrian intelligence operatives to a false flag attack conducted by Turkish intelligence. <br><br>The last possibility is not particularly likely, but is a constant in contemporary Turkey. A poll conducted shortly after the Ankara bombing showed that 21.1<percent> of Turks thought Erdo\u011fan or the AKP was behind the bombing (24.9<percent> thought ISIS; 37.9<percent> PKK or HDP; 14<percent> thought <dq>outside forces<dq>; 2<percent> answered <dq>other<dq>). These results varied strongly by political party, with more CHP and HDP voters blaming Erdo\u011fan and the AKP, and more AKP and MHP voters blaming HDP and the PKK (the rally in Ankara was co-sponsored by the HDP). These were not just idle  speculation by conspiracy nuts--weeks later, AKP leaders claimed it was somehow [a mix of the PKK and ISIS and Syrian intelligence](http<colon>//www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/turkey-syria-isis-ankara-bombings-terror-cocktail-kurds-pyd.html). Meanwhile, HDP leadership almost immediately speculated that Turkey<sq>s intelligence services were either incompetent or complicit. It<sq>s important to realize that the current spate of PKK violence in Turkey comes directly out of the Suru\u00e7 bombing, which the PKK blamed on Turkey<sq>s intelligence services. <br><br>So, the bombing in Ankara was both less surprising and had less of a clear narrative. The Charlie<sq>s Hebdo attacks were certainly a precedent for these attacks in France, but the coverage widely treated those attackers as <dq>lone wolves<dq> with relatively limited material support from outside groups. This attack was obviously quite different.  Two more minor points is that the terror in Paris was more effective at terrorizing. In Turkey, these ISIS bombings have targeted a marginalized group (the Kurds) at political rallies. They have been one and done--the bombs exploded and the attack was over. The Paris attack was much more random. It was also much more personal and the violence much more intimate, with hostages being taken and people murdered individually over a longer period of time. News organizations started covering the attacks as they were on-going, which (I assume) helped push the story to the front of the news page.  Compare the Ankara attack to, for example, the [Mumbai attacks](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks). The death tolls are roughly similar, the cultures roughly equally distant, but I believe the nature of the Mumbai attacks helped draw more attention to them (I made no attempt to quantify the relative levels of attention, however, so take that last comparison as an impressionistic assessment). </p>",

More specifically, the use of chemical weapons violates the [Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention). Conventional weapons are given more leeway (legally speaking) in conflicts under international law (See [The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Conventional_Weapons)<br><br>It<sq>s not really so much about their efficiency, rather it<sq>s about how brutal they are.

Think of them like invisible landmines, where even in decades post-conflict they can still maim and kill unintended targets.<br><br>Historically, of course examples of chemical weapon attacks only reinforce the brutality of the weapons.

(They clearly had no compunction about using it elsewhere.) It\u2019s highly unpleasant to be gassed, but then it\u2019s just as unpleasant to be perforated or shredded by pieces of metal. As far as numbers are concerned, gas is far less lethal than bullets and bombs. In World War I fewer than 1 percent of the men who were injured by poison gas died from their injuries, and these fatalities added up to less than 1 percent of the war\u2019s death toll.<br><br>...<br><br>> One possibility is that the human mind finds something distinctively repugnant about poison. Whatever suspension of the normal rules of decency allows warriors to do their thing, it seems to license only the sudden and directed application of force against an adversary who has the potential todo the same. Even pacifists may enjoy war movies or video games in which people get shot, stabbed, or blown up, but no one seems to get pleasure from watching a greenish cloud descend on a battlefield and slowly turn men into corpses. The poisoner has long been reviled as a uniquely foul and perfidious killer. Poison is the method of the sorcerer rather than the warrior; of the woman (with her terrifying control of kitchen and medicine chest) rather than the man. <br><br>...<br><br>> Whatever abhorrence of poisoning we might have inherited from our evolutionary or cultural past, it needed a boost from historical contingency to become entrenched as a taboo on the conduct of war. Price conjectures that the critical nonevent was that in World War I, poison gas was never deliberately used against civilians. At least in that application, no taboo-shattering precedent had been set, and the widespread horror in the 1930s about the prospect that gas-dispensing airplanes could annihilate entire cities rallied people into categorically opposing all uses of the weapons.<br><br>**tldr** Poison gas is taboo because poison is a dishonorable weapon and people are afraid of mass gassing of civilians (i.e. the parade scene in 1989 Batman)<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>It definitely hasn<sq>t always been the case in the US. During the 19th century, economic populism was a common political message through farmers groups such as the Grange. This continued through the New Deal (the post-Depression political order), as FDR made farmers a central piece of his coalition. <br><br>During the Progressive Era (a bipartisan movement for a more active federal government to solve societal problems, active in the early 1900s), arguably the most liberal area of the United States was the overwhelmingly-rural North Dakota. This movement, [the Nonpartisan League](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_League), foreshadowed the rural activism of the 1930s. [In fact, look at FDR<sq>s margins of victory in the still-mostly-rural state of California.](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_California,_1932) I wouldn<sq>t expect you to know the counties of California, but just look at the population totals and you can see that the smallest (and now most conservative counties) favored FDR by a wide margin, while the urban areas of San Francisco and LA were less favorable to FDR. <br><br>It<sq>s hard to say for sure why this changed, but it<sq>s the result of many factors, and the change happened in the post-WWII era. Race is central to the story of America<sq>s cities. Prior to WWII, America<sq>s black population resided almost exclusively in the South. World War II industrialization caused the greatest internal migration of black Americans in history, and they moved from overwhelmingly rural areas in the South to urban areas in the North and West. This was a sudden, drastic change that made race pervasive in areas that had never faced the issue before. This coincided with the shift of black voters to Democrats (FDR was the first Dem to win the black vote), and over the next few decades race fundamentally changed the parties. The coalitions changed, and shifting coalitions can change the policy positions of groups within the coalition. <br><br>The rise of suburbs happened after WWII as well. As black populations moved to the inner cities, the new interstate highway system allowed the suburbs to explode with white residents fleeing the cities. The suburbs became the place where the white middle class increasingly lived, making urban cores increasingly black and brown. The Civil Rights movement tore apart the old Democratic and Republican coalitions, furthering the dominance of the Democratic party among minority voters and expelling conservative Democrats from the party. <br><br>There are many, many factors besides these. Liberals tend to be at the top and bottom of the economic pyramid, and cities became the refuge of the well-to-do elite as well as the poor urban population. Cities attracted more knowledge workers, causing more lawyers and academics to move within city limits. Suburbs attracted families who backed law-and-order candidates while younger liberal students remained in cities. The GI Bill exploded college towns and the huge educated class resided nearby. Manufacturing was located in cities and dominated by strong unions, and liberals in the US are much friendlier to labor. And so on. </p>",

It simply made more sense to have everyone come gather in one place to study or trade. Once you gather people together they can observe what their neighbor or competitor is doing and imitate it or improve on it. That means more experimentation in both economic and social norms. Additionally, history shows us that less people are <dq>from<dq> cities which means that they have less ties to any given tradition or social norm. <br><br>On the flip side, rural areas can often trace their lineage and the traditions of their ancestors back several generations. There<sq>s less incentive to shake up the social norm. <br><br>Anyway, all of these are broad generalizations and obviously subject to tons of exceptions, qualifications, and rebuttal but these are the most obvious reasons that I<sq>ve read about.</p>",

Trying to define these terms has become an extremely politicized issue in Rwanda since the end of the genocide.<br><br>Before I move to the more controversial aspects, let me state some facts about Hutu<sq>s and Tutsi<sq>s that most everyone agrees on. Hutu<sq>s and Tutsi<sq>s currently inhabit the countries of Rwanda and Burundi, and parts of Eastern Congo, Southern Uganda, and Western Tanzania. <br><br>In Burundi and Rwanda, where they speak the mutually intelligible languages of Kirundi and Kinyarwanda, they make up about 98-99<percent> of those countries<sq> population, with Tutsi<sq>s composing a minority of somewhere between 10-20<percent> and Hutu<sq>s the remaining 80-90<percent>. In the other countries I mentioned, the situation is a bit more confusing, with separate ethnic groups such as the Banyamurenge/Banyamulenge who are considered <sq>Congolese Tutsi<sq>s<sq> having roots in their Congolese communities for many generations, and displaced Hutu<sq>s and Tutsi<sq>s from Burundi and Rwanda living in the diaspora. <br><br>Since you mentioned the 1994 genocide, and not the 1972 genocide, or the 1993 assasination and ethnic conflict, I<sq>m assuming your question is about Rwanda, but it is important to understand that Hutu and Tutsi communities (co)exist outside Rwanda, and their relations are different than they are in Rwanda. I<sq>ll focus more on Rwanda, but return to the situation in neighbouring countries/regions when necessary. <br><br>Since Hutu<sq>s and Tutsi<sq>s share a common language and history, they are unlike some other ethnic groups in neighbouring countries, in the sense that they have been considered separate classes, races, and ethnicities at different points and by different leaders and historians. <br><br>Colonial <sq>anthropologists<sq> immediately identified the Tutsis as a superior leading Nilotic/Hamitic/European(ish) race, with the Hutu as an inferior Bantu peasant race. You probably know about the way the Germans and Belgians imposed their racial fantasies onto the population by issuing identity cards, racial quotas, and racist propaganda. <br><br>Post-colonial historians often consider them ethnic groups; recognizing that the farming Hutus likely inhabited the region before the pastoral Tutsis moved in and established monarchies. Over the centuries, these ethnic groups became less rigid, and Hutus were able to <sq>become<sq> Tutsi through wealth acquisition or intermarriage. Nonetheless, despite all those generations of mutual assimilation, Tutsi and Hutu remained separate and self-identifiable markers, and Hutu and Tutsi often lived somewhat separated before, during, and after the colonial period.<br><br>The current Rwandan government has a different interpretation of Rwandan history, and considers Tutsi and Hutu outdated concepts which were nothing more than social classes. They emphasize the shared language, and attribute the idea of Hutu and Tutsi as ethnicities or races as entirely due to colonial intervention. In modern-day Rwanda, referring to Hutu or Tutsi anywhere but in a historical context is not approved of, and done in a political context, it is actually illegal. In order to understand fully the details, origins and implications of this policy, I have to rehash a little bit of the history of Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda.<br><br>In 1959, sensing the coming independence of the countries, the Belgians switched to supporting the Hutu majority, resulting in a revolution, independence, and a Hutu majoritarian regime which fanned further ethnic tensions. Tutsi<sq>s were intermittently massacred and exiled to neighbouring countries, Hutu nationalism became more and more entrenched, and the amount of exiled Tutsi<sq>s reached big proportions, especially in Uganda. <br><br>There, Tutsi rebels, from within the Ugandan army, organized a powerful, well-organized rebel force called the RPF, which repeatedly invaded the country in order to force the leadership out of power and demand the return of the Tutsi diaspora. This escalated Hutu oppression, and, after the assassination of the Hutu President by as yet unidentified forces, ultimately led to Hutu-on-Tutsi genocide organized by a Hutu leadership. The RPF continued on with their invasion, and  took over the country and has ruled it ever since as the dominant political party under the leadership of Paul Kagame.<br><br>The RPF has been hailed by many as a progressive, inclusive, and forgiving party which has brought a remarkable stability and relative economic prosperity to the country. However, its leader is also without doubt a dictator who has shut down independent media and opposition parties, orchestrated a series of manipulated elections, and put the need for security above all else.<br><br>Because of this, many critics maintain that the policy of <sq>erasing<sq> the concepts of Hutu and Tutsi in favour of the concept of <sq>Banyarwanda<sq> (Rwandan) is partly a ploy to hide the fact that the Tutsi President and his close confidants are all from the minority ethnic group. These same critics would argue that the policy has been effectively used to imprison political opponents and journalists, and that the dramatic, traumatic, and continuous displays of mourning and remembrance of the <dq>Genocide against the Tutsi<dq> have been used to legitimize the government as the saviours of the nation, since they can claim to have ended the genocide.<br><br>In reality, the situation is probably more complicated. I believe that the Kagame regime does care about reconciliation, and the fact that leading Hutu figures have been recruited to the party and the military (in effect an extension of the party) shows that they are not Tutsi supremacists. Poverty alleviation schemes target all Rwandans, and ordinary (former) Hutus benefit a lot when the country becomes more stable and prosperous. <br><br>Therefore, <sq>the Tutsis<sq> do not rule Rwanda. In fact, inside Rwanda, there are other divides that might be more important. The ruling elites who control most businesses, have decided to switch the country<sq>s national language from French to English, hold the key positions in the army and governance are overwhelmingly *Anglophone* Tutsis; those who were part of the Ugandan Tutsi diaspora during the years of Hutu rule, or their descendants. Tutsis who remained in the country throughout its troubled history - those who were most likely to be victimized - are Francophone Tutsis who sometimes feel like the Anglophone/Francophone divide matters more than the former ethnic divide. <br><br>Nonetheless, there remain a large number of former genocidaires outside the country who still want to seek <sq>revenge<sq> on the Tutsis. This feeling is far less prominent inside the country, where a very large proportion of the population has been born after the genocide. Hutu killers have mostly been released from prison by now, after having to admit to their crimes, beg for forgiveness, and spend time doing community service. <br><br>The powerful presence of the government at every level of society has prevented most people from airing ethnic speech, and I think that the propaganda and the continuous attempts at erasing <sq>genocidal ideology<sq> have succeeded when it comes to the youngest generations. The government has aggressively sought to reconcile survivors with perpetrators, and has been successful in preventing ethnic political or other organizations besides widow, orphan, or survivor groups from emerging. <br><br>The government<sq>s dream of a society where ethnicity does not exist is still a utopia, as even the youngest generation is well-aware of their ethnicity and those of the people around them. Ethnic stereotypes remain well-known, even if it is more taboo to discuss them. From personal experience, Hutus are more likely to date/marry Hutu and Tutsi to date within their group. <br><br>However, trying to find social scientific data on this is near impossible. While the country issues a lot of research visas, and a lot of PhDs and other research has focused on the genocide and certain post-genocide policies and developments, the country has banned a few prominent Rwandan experts for <sq>propagating revisionist history<sq>, and it would not approve of large-scale social science research aiming to find the exact answer to your question.<br><br><br>*edit sources<colon><br><br>On the debates about pre-colonial relationships between Hutu and Tutsi, and on the post-genocidal policies of erasure, see *Re-imagining Rwanda* by Pottier.<br><br>On the post-colonial, pre-genocidal period, see Mahmood Mamdani<sq>s *When Victims become Killers* <br><br>Information about the origins of the RPF and the Anglophone/Francophone divide can be found in Prunier<colon> *Africa<sq>s World War, Congo, the Rwandan Genocide, and the Making of a Continental Catastrophe*.

Here<sq>s my thoughts.<br><br>The reason why most other countries can<sq>t just copy Denmark is because what works in one country may not work in another one. It<sq>s impossible to govern countries like Nigeria in the same way as Denmark. Denmark is a relatively small (5,6 mil) and homogeneous country (only very lately have they started to receive a lot of immigrants - this has also caused Denmark to have one of the toughest immigration laws in Europe). <br><br>Also, let<sq>s not forget that in a democracy the way the country is governed is a reflection of the population. Danish people aren<sq>t the way they are because of the policies of the government. The policies of the government are caused by the population (the Danish culture - the values and the ideals). First you have the culture and then you get the policies. Not the other way around. Many states in the New England area of the US are quite similar when compared to the Scandinavia. If they would be independent countries, even more so. Denmark really isn<sq>t doing anything *that* special. <br><br>Denmark has had peace for a long time. It has a lot of agricultural land, is placed in a geographically good area and has a moderately well-educated population. It<sq>s small and homogeneous. It would probably be successful no matter what it<sq>s specific policies are.

                "answer": "<p>Canada has been an interesting breeding ground for good work in the area of identity-theory as it relates to multiculturalism and governance, so I will try to draw from that.<br><br>Will Kymlicka (1995) talks about there being two sorts of strict identities that shape all (but especially modern) people.  The first is a sense of self, or I, which is defined by oneself, and includes liberal values of individualism, but also cultural values defined by family and community.  The second is other, identity pressures that are interacting with our self-identity.  The challenge of a modern society (or any society) is to find a way to balance one<sq>s self-identity with broadly accepted communal identity.  But what about when it clashes?  What about a country where the majority is English-speaking, but a visible minority is French-speaking? (Canada).  Or what about this case, where a Czech community is defining how, culturally, members of their society should be performing their identities?  <br><br>Charles Taylor (1994) talked about the same dialectic at play. There is a strong tendency to support one side or the other, a purely liberal recognition of all equality for individual, for example, or the communal recognition of a definition of performance and identity. Focusing on just one half will always result in a clash.  E.g., by promoting pure liberalism, a majority rule of equal citizens can result in certain culturally unique traits being discriminated against, like the case of an English Canada that refuses to allow French Canada to have unique recognition.  But this, predictably, results in anger from the minority group, which impacts their ability to live a meaningful life.  Alternatively, giving in entirely to community-based definitions of identity can result in members of that very community feeling like their individual identity to choose how to live is being challenged.<br><br>Taking it back to your case, I think we have a similar dynamic playing out.  Your self identity is being challenged by a community identity, even a majority identity, that is telling you how to live.  At the same time, your self-identity to fall in love with someone of a different culture challenges their communal identity, creating a clash.  <br><br>Is cultural appropriation a bad thing?  Absolutely not, but what it means is, until humanity has a global culture (which is on the rise), the communal cultures within it will always and predictably, at different scales, feel challenged by your unwillingness to conform.  Does this suggest you should conform?  Absolutely not.  A modern multicultural society evolves to recognize that at times identities are challenged, but that it is through acceptance and public discourse that self-identity and communal-identity can be recognized together.  But what this does mean, in the long run, is communal identities will indeed face global cultural appropriation given the very nature of globalization (unless they close their borders and shut down their internet).  The long-term trends of human development and the mixing of identities favours your arrangement, but in the short-term, and in specific contexts, your arrangement challenges communal identities that have not yet accommodated to the globalized world.<br><br>Robinson (2007) made a compelling case that you should  not worry about what others think, because while yes, you are challenging their old-fashioned identity, you are simply pursuing a <sq>meaningful life<sq> that matters to you, such as by falling in love with someone, and clearly communal identity doesn<sq>t shape your identity as strongly as it does for some of your neighbours (by the fact you didn<sq>t even think of this until others raised it to you).  They are threatened because their <sq>self<sq> as a communal group feels threatened, but your being with a Chinese man does not legitimately threaten their access to a <sq>meaningful life<sq>, while them telling you to conform, is indeed threatening a <sq>meaningful life<sq>.  In the clash of identities, modern societies err on the side of promoting that <sq>meaningful life<sq>, how ever it is defined, be it as a self-identity or communal identity, or both, but generally, preference should always be given to what ever identity (or adaptations) enables one to live a meaningful and happy life.  <br><br><br>*Cited sources<colon>*<br><br>Kymlicka, Will (1995).

This might have included a detached rear coach house for horses to minimize fecal odor, an entrance for servants, and place for deliveries such as ice.  All of this came through the alley, and for many towns the alley was a plotted part of the public right of way long after cars started to come into use.  <br><br>Enter the 20th century, and the discourse on how towns are planned changes.  The dense development that came with alleys is associated with disease and crime.  The new cause in urban planning becomes giving people light, space and separation.  The personal car helps with this idea.  And one way of selling people on the idea of car ownership is by getting rid of the coach house and on street parking, and creating homes with an attached garage visible from the street, almost like a billboard for cars on every home.  By the 1950s, the GI Bill allows WWII veterans low interest home loans.

Often these new developments were not under control of a municipality (or a tiny one with no planning staff) and decisions were left to the developer himself.

Or is this flawed reasoning ?<br><br>This is the exact issue that statistically justifies the use of IQ tests. One of the most empirically supported observations in all of the social sciences is that basic cognitive tasks (e.g., arithmetic, vocabulary, or working memory tests) almost always inter correlate with one another (so you don<sq>t just see a correlation between, for example, language based tests. These tests correlate with all others and vice versa). This is sometimes referred to as the positive manifold in intelligence testing and the evidence supporting it is astounding, [pretty much every good sample over the last 100 years has identified this pattern of correlations](http<colon>//www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/human-cognitive-abilities-survey-factor-analytic-studies).<br><br>What this means statistically is that a a decent chunk of variance between individuals is shared by all tests, methods exist to measure this shared variance indirectly by defining latent variables, due to the pervasive inter-correlations in cognitive tasks the best latent variable structure for such tasks is built around a single general factor (sometimes called *g*) and this essentially measures what is common to all basic cognitive tasks. This general factor accounts for about 40-60<percent> of all variance in individual items. So the common remark that differences in cognitive ability are too complicated to measure with a single number are true, but that single number alone accounts for a huge proportion of what<sq>s going on there. It<sq>s this general factor that IQ tests are designed to measure (and their validation will usually revolve around how well they do this).<br><br>Long story short, in the cognitive domain, IQ scores will pretty assuredly, by the existence of the positive manifold and the means by which IQ scores are defined, positively correlate with basic cognitive tasks. It would be pretty notable if tasks were found for which this isn<sq>t the case<br><br>That<sq>s for basic tasks, more involved tasks don<sq>t have the same near certain positive correlation but the range of tasks that do relate positively is pretty comprehensive.

To this, I would point you to some [Pew surveys](http<colon>//www.npr.org/2011/11/03/141984787/generation-gap-how-age-shapes-political-outlook) which show that Baby Boomers are in fact more conservative than younger voters. So, this portrayal is accurate.<br><br>However, what I think you might be asking is why Baby Boomers were part of a radical movement in the past, but over time have become more conservative. I think there are a few aspects of this question for you to think about. One is that, despite the way we think of it now, how many Baby Boomers were actually part of <dq>counterculture movements<dq> in their youth? I don<sq>t know the answer to this but I imagine a historian might (I looked on /r/AskHistorians for a similar question but [only found this](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1pqd0y/how_much_widespread_support_did_the/)). For comparison, the Occupy Wall Street protests were seen as representative of modern youth counterculture in the media, but the amount of people sleeping at Zuccotti seem to have been [on the order of hundreds](http<colon>//www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/occupy-dc-theyre-occupying-but-whos-counting/2011/10/31/gIQAZBecaM_story.html) rather than thousands or tens of thousands. So, you don<sq>t necessarily need a large number of people doing something radical for that thing to be incorrectly ascribed as representative of a larger group (cough cough Islam and terrorism).<br><br>The second thing is, why should we expect a person<sq>s location on the political spectrum to be maintained over time? What is radical one day becomes absolutely commonsense the next (women<sq>s suffrage), and people themselves change their beliefs based on their experiences over time (e.g. learning). If, for instance, gay marriage weren<sq>t associated with voting rights legislation in the 60s, why should we expect radicals from the 60s to have one particular stance towards gay marriage?

However, I would temper that with [this article](http<colon>//www.le.ac.uk/ec/research/RePEc/lec/leecon/dp09-23.pdf) which indicates that for some groups, there may be a divide between how we view ourselves politically (more radical or more conservative) and our <dq>actual beliefs<dq> as revealed by survey items (I<sq>d appreciate if someone could confirm whether their methodology is sound here, though). So people might be seeing themselves as still holding countercultural views, while nonetheless becoming part of the dominant culture through their actual behaviors.<br><br>I hope this helped you think about your question a bit, since what you asked has a lot of moving parts and I was a little unsure what you were trying to get at.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Asexual people are relatively rare. A study in the UK found that approximately 1 out of 100 people are asexual (Bogaert, Anthony F. (2004). <dq>Asexuality<colon> prevalence and associated factors in a national probability sample<dq>. Journal of Sex Research 41 (3)<colon> 279\u201387).  To get a large probability (random) sample would be difficult.  So to find 100 asexual people to ask about body image in a phone survey, you<sq>d have to get 10,000 to answer the phone and agree to answer questions. That<sq>s a lot of people and I can<sq>t think of an easy way to <dq>over sample<dq> asexual people. And you<sq>d have to call MORE than that because response rates for telephone surveys are fairly low (so if it were a 50<percent> response rate, we<sq>d have to call 20,000 people to find 100 asexual people to ask about body image). 100<sq>s not a horrible subsample for social stats though. The problem really only comes since body dismorphia itself is relatively rare (also around 1<percent>), if it were completely absent from our subsample of 100 asexual people and present in 99 out of 9900 non-asexual people, we wouldn<sq>t know if this was due to random chance or if it was because the rate were really lower (if body dismorphia were noticeably higher among asexual people in real life, that might be easier to pick up in our random sample of 100 asexuals), ie. we<sq>d need even bigger samples to answer this with survey methods. <br><br>I<sq>m not saying this work hasn<sq>t been done or can<sq>t be done, or that there are no studies that could weigh in on this (especially from convenience samples of people in treatment for body disphoria), but I<sq>m saying it would not surprise me if there were no good data on this available just because of sample size issues. Compounding that, because of privacy things, it<sq>s rare for surveys that focus on questions about sexuality to become publicly available. The only one I can think of is National Health and Social Life Survey, and I don<sq>t know if they ask about body dismorphia. Large sample surveys, like the General Social Survey or the World Values Survey or the various Pew Surveys, I don<sq>t think have asked questions about body dismorphia, either. If one survey did, it would be ADD HEALTH, but I don<sq>t think that likely has a large enough sample size to give you the answer even if you did have access to it. <br><br>It<sq>s an interesting question, with an interesting hypothesis, but ones that<sq>s difficult to test by normal survey methods. Experimental methods might be able to test broader claims about response to body image stimulus (indeed, even the large surveys might be able to do something based on <dq>mean body image<dq> or something because then we<sq>d would be able to leverage the statistical power of the full sample of asexuals surveyed), but actually getting into the pathology would be difficult because both conditions are so rare in the general population. <br><br>Edit<colon> I was playing around with a [z-test calculator](http<colon>//www.socscistatistics.com/tests/ztest/) and if it<sq>s 1/100 in the general population, even if it was only a quarter as likely in the asexual population, if we had a sample of 40,400 people, of which 400 were asexual, 401 had body dismoprhia, and only 1 out of the 400 asexualls had body dismorphia (that is, 1/4 of the general rate, which is substantively a big difference and probably more different than I<sq>d expect), we *still* wouldn<sq>t be able to say with standard significance levels (.05) that the two were different, even doing a one-tailed test! (It would be a significant difference at the .10 confidence level if we were running a one-tailed test, but in most social research I<sq>ve seen people are really reluctant to run one-tailed tests even when it<sq>s theoretically justified, so you might still have trouble getting this result passed peer review). </p>",

However, while the factors may look the same, the criteria for weighting those factors *may* look wildly different.<br><br>Last, and I haven<sq>t had time look into it, but Rasmussen as late as 2012 **did not** provide a Spanish-language interview option like Pew does. Voters with low-English ability are much more likely to hang up or refuse to answer if they feel like they cannot adequately understand/answer the questions.

[Here](http<colon>//psych.la.psu.edu/shields/home/resources/GenderEmotionChapter.pdf) is the multi page source that will both answer and complicate the question for you.  TL DR<colon> there are gender differences in what emotions are displayed.  <br><br>Further, we live in a world that has been male driven for all of our written history.  Genuine emotional display equalizes humanity between empathic creatures.  Imagine a secretary breaking down and crying because the boss did something unjust.  Was the secretary male or female in your mind?  How about the boss?  The weird thing is, when the power dynamic is skewed, the emotional tantrum of the person in lower power position is an effective tool for sticking up for your rights if you are accepted as part of the in group.  <br><br>Now pile on top of that how men are trained to deal with emotions.  Anger is condoned.  Sociopathy is condoned.  But sadness is not expressed. James Bond, Hercules, and John McClane have all killed numerous people and it doesn<sq>t affect them one bit.  Meanwhile, soldiers return from a war wrecked from psychological stress if not Traumatic Brain injury.  Further, in the courtship arena, while women are trained to be emotionally attentive and boys emotionally disengaged, the power dynamics through history have worked out in such a way that the female opinion is waved off as too emotional, while male emotionality is ignored or accepted as the standard to which all other expression is compared.<br><br>I think the safest bet would be to disbelieve that women are biologicallly more emotional than men.  The two caveats to that are<colon> during periods of hormone flux, (e.g. menopause, pregnancy, adolescence, steroid use) women will be more <dq>emotional<dq> relative to their personal baseline.  Also, unreported trauma leaves psychological marks, and in the US, the statistics range from 10<percent> to 20<percent> of women are victims of a sexual assault.

(white educated industrialized rich democratic) sampling bias to most studies of gender differences. We seem to have only enough unbiased global research to determine that there is some degree of universality to a handful of base emotions (research of Ekman, Shaver, Plutchik, etc.).<br><br>However, we know enough about neurophysiology to say that there are some flaws in the question being asked. There is no single emotional system. Instead, there appear to be a handful of systems dependent upon limbic structures that are relatively autonomous. Fear/anxiety is rooted in the amygdala and seems to utilize GABA, aggression and depression also seem dependent upon the amygdala but are serotonergic, disgust comes from serotonin in the insula, etc. On top of that, the cortex appears to duplicate a lot of subcortical functions, adding complexity to experience and inhibiting or exciting emotional reactions. Serotonergic processes in the right prefrontal cortex appear central to behavioral inhibition, and seem to be implicated more in negative emotions, whereas dopaminergic processes in the left prefrontal cortex are more central to behavioral activation, and are more involved with positive emotions.<br><br>Based on this, we do know that there are some gender differences in specific emotions. Testosterone is unequivocally linked to anger and aggression, and is higher in males. The amygdala is also one of the more highly sexual dimorphic brain structures, which means that there are probably gender differences in strong negative emotions (not necessarily more/less, but different). Under stress, men release more cortisol (mobilizing the sympathetic nervous system to prepare for action) while women release more oxytocin (leading to seeking social support). There are also sex differences in insular volume which appear to be related to disgust reactions being stronger in women, particularly for sexual behavior, where it may be the single strongest factor predicting sexual attraction in women, yet it plays little role in male sexual attraction.<br><br>Most of this stuff is documented in graduate level biopsychology textbooks.

This information will be incomplete as I<sq>m at work and don<sq>t have the book on hand.<br><br>There are three strands of arguments that help explain the various levels of penitence, the exact names of which escape me but there<sq>s an instrumental argument (ie, politicians manipulated their stance on war to serve national or self interest), cultural (there is a distinct difference between European and East Asian ways of recalling the past) and another...which I can<sq>t remember too well. (Sorry.)<br><br>For the sake of messing with order lets start with cultural. I<sq>m not a huge fan of this argument but it does make sense. Austrian and German culture appreciate the concept of guilt. Guilt, it is argued, is a something has trickled down through society via the medium of Christianity. Being sorry for something is often important on the way to atonement. Germany was able to show greater penitence for its past because of the Western acceptance of this guilt cultural phenomena. (China and South Korea do make plenty of arguments about Japanese lack of penitence, so there is a slight hole in that line of thinking. ) <br>Japanese culture however values shame. So essentially you get this dichotomy of shame vs guilt. Shame culture doesn<sq>t so much require a large public apology to show atonement. Quite often and offering of compensation is often enough to show penitence. Japan did offer a struggling South Korea a substantial sum of money in the 1960 normalisation process that prescribed that South Korean citizens were no longer able to claim compensation. The Korea Republic took it, so in the minds of some Japanese politicians, this issue had been dealt with. <br><br>As for the instrumentalist argument, this is something that I used relatively extensively in my Masters thesis. For the record, I don<sq>t recall the chapters from Berger on Germany too well as it wasn<sq>t something I was overly familiar with when I started reading the book, but there were essentially external and internal forces within Europe that forced German administrators to be more penitent. I<sq>m not sure if this is exactly from the book, but a more penitent Germany would have been more beneficial for Western Europe looking at trying to withstand Soviet influence. A powerhouse like Germany was well needed to defend against the USSR for the rest of Europe but also the USA. You couldn<sq>t have a border nation with the Eastern bloc caught in the middle of Western Europeans that hate you and Eastern bloc nations that are looking to jump you. Anyway, there was a political reason to do it.<br><br>Asia was very different for Japan. Whilst Japanese atrocities were certainly no better than what the Nazis did in Germany, the political realities were a little different. Immediately following the second world war, Japan was stripped of arms and became an occupied nation, this was only to be followed up very soon after by the war on the Korean peninsula. Suddenly Japan was needed as a forward base for American operations. Japanese police forces were rearmed and military-like entities started to emerge again. US interests in Asia and the interest in repelling the communist threat overrode the need to continue the pacification process. Japan basically went from enemy to ally in the space of 10 years. Japan also experienced exponential growth in the following decades leaving much of East Asia behind, again. <br>Looking China and South Korea at the time, in the 50<sq>s and 60<sq>s both were more preoccupied with rebuilding their countries than standing up and asking for apologies from the Japanese. Mao was busy with his cultural revolutions and spreading the good word through China and as I mentioned above, the RoK took a lot of money from Japan to improve it<sq>s economic growth in return for basically forgetting about what happened in World War II. Japan essentially was not bombarded in the same way that Germany was following World War II and was also somewhat vindicated when the US immediately turned to them for help in the Korean war as well as significantly investing in the Japanese economy to create a US-allied economic giant to form a pillar against the possible threats in the Asia-Pacific. <br><br>To keep going, it is so much easier to pin the war atrocities from Germany on the Nazis. When looking at the history of world war II, it was the Nazis that committed the atrocities, not <sq>Germany<sq> as such. Everyone can finger Hitler when looking at the worst crimes but you can<sq>t really pin it on anyone in Japan, not in the same way.<br><br>Much debate has centred around the role of the Emperor in the way Japan conducted its foreign policy (See Hirohito and the making of Japan by Herbert Bix). The US occupying forces essentially saw it as a bad idea to implicate the Emperor in Japan<sq>s war atrocities as there was a great cult of personality surrounding him and of course much argument as to how much direct involvement he actually had. Since the Meiji restoration, the Emperor as god had been kind of central to how Japanese people imagined their country. The Emperor was the head of the Shinto religion and was able to exert influence as such. However, much of this influence could be symbolic. That is another discussion that I can come back to at another point. <br>What I am saying is that there was no obvious singular instigator to point to.<br><br>I would also like to add that Japanese people are generally quite pacifist these days, they don<sq>t like the idea of war, but that is not because of what they inflicted on the world but rather what war brought upon them. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are two modern disasters that both fell upon the Japanese killing hundreds of thousands of people. Add into the mix the air-raids and fire bombings and Japan was utterly devastated. This has made people fearful of war but not apologetic to the rest of world. I think, just anecdotally, that Japanese people are more insular than many other peoples I have interacted with. <br><br>As for the current situation, the Japanese government has issued no less than [49 official apologies for the war since the 1950<sq>s.](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan)<br><br>The reason there seems to be such furor about Japan<sq>s lack of atonement for the past to me seems like a lot of nationalistic chest beating on the other side of the fence the South Korean government is notorious for drumming up anti-Japanese sentiment to prop up it<sq>s approval ratings and Chinese anger also has more instrumental roots. By trying to deligitimise Japan<sq>s past, it can add further validity to it<sq>s own land claims and the like such as the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Not only this, but it can also distract the public from internal issues as with South Korea. <br><br>I hope that helps your understanding a little bit, but I really do recommend reading Thomas Berger<sq>s book for a better understanding.</p>",

These building were built in such a way to discourage neighbors from seeing each other. Halls, stairwells, and stoops were designed to discourage congregation outside. The idea that the designers had was that because many of these people had been <dq>criminals,<dq> <dq>good<dq> community design would inhibit <dq>recriminalization<dq> by keeping people from getting to know each other. The idea being that deviant behavior would just be encouraged by other deviants.<br><br>There were other architectural designs added, like bars over light fixtures to <dq>deter stealing<dq> (stealing light-bulbs it would seem). What came of this housing projects is that they made problems worse, not better. The style of the buildings isolated residents from each other, reproducing the same kinds of effects many of them had experienced while incarcerated. People had a harder time acclimating to civil life again, and many suffered for it. I am going to try to find the source, but this might be related to your question. (I will wrack my brains and try to find the source)<br><br>However, in terms of <dq>soviet style,<dq> I do know that in many east European countries, the devaluation and demolition of soviet culture has met with a fair amount of resistance. Like when Germany was united, many western Germans talked and acted as if *they* had rescued or <dq>fixed<dq> the country, saving eastern Germans from their plight. Many eastern Germans subsequently felt that their ways of living and doing things were disparaged as <dq>un-German.<dq> Further, eastern Germans faced social problems like homelessness and unemployment that had not existed under communism.

                "answer": "<p>If I<sq>m allowed, I think I may be able to approach this from an urban planning perspective to answer your question.  What you describe of high density un-ornamented housing is very indicative of the <dq>rationalist<dq> or <dq>Modernist<dq> city planning, which was most popular in the 1950<sq>s and 60<sq>s with people like [Robert Moses](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses) but dates back to Le Corbusier and his 1920<sq>s plan for what he called [Ville Radieuse](http<colon>//www.archdaily.com/411878/ad-classics-ville-radieuse-le-corbusier/) or the Radiant City.  This was mainly developed as a reaction to the congested, dirty, and often haphazard organization of industrial cities at the time that were notorious for being dangerous to live in.  After the massive devastation of WWII and the need to rebuild on a grand scale, Modern city planning embraced Corbusier<sq>s idea of <dq>Tower in the Park<dq> which includes large monolithic concrete towers arranged within a open green space.  This would allow a rational organization of uses, more egalitarian communities, and an abundance of green living space allowing a supposedly healthier city life with ample access to light and air denied to the claustrophobic city of before.<br><br>It<sq>s varies how <dq>modernist planning<dq> these ideas were implemented<colon> A few new cities were built from scratch like [Chandigarh](http<colon>//www.dwell.com/modern-world/article/city-chandigarh-le-corbusier#4) or [Brasilia](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras<percent>C3<percent>ADlia).  Soviet planners liked it as an application of their <dq>scientific management<dq> or social engineering ideas.  Europe, in a housing crisis after the war liked it as a symbol of the new modern countries they hoped to build.  And even in US, amid its post-war housing boom, used it as part of their projects for Urban Renewal and Public Housing.   Egalitarian, rational, forward thinking, Modern planning seemed very effective for allowing the density of the modern city without the clutter and mess associated with it.  (It is worth noting how compromised some of these projects were because of political forces, corruption, racism, forceful removal, destruction of neighborhoods and other issues.  This could kill or seriously dampen the effectiveness of any design modern or not even before it was constructed and would be the source of it<sq>s tainted reputation in the public eye, but this whole history is best a whole other story.)<br><br>But the big criticism comes from probably the main source you probably want to read<colon> [Jane Jacobs<sq> The Death and Life of Great American Cities.](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities)  Her main point is that the essence of vibrant neighborhoods is to foster the complex interactions of social life which was being utterly destroyed by the single minded logic of modern city planners.  Her focus is especially on the street and sidewalk as the main mechanism of this where the intricate theater of social life plays out.  To have <dq>eyes on the street<dq> with actively used and seen public spaces deters crime.  To have casual public interactions creates social cohesion by fostering contact between people of different income, race, or background.  With easy supervision allows children to learn <dq>first fundamental of successful city life<colon> People must take a modicum of public responsibility for each other even if they have no ties to each other.<dq>  Basically, her frustration with modern city planners is that lessons learned from suburbia such as emphasis on privacy, car-centric lifestyles, and low density development (all decidedly anti-urban qualities) and apply it to designing full urban cities themselves.  Though she wasn<sq>t a planner herself, here work did inspire what is today confusingly called [New Urbanism](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Urbanism) whose focus on walkability, diversity of housing and job types, regional focus, and of density that is comfortable to the human scale, all of which problems most associated with the failures of Modernist planning projects.  <br><br>I apologize if this is not quite what your asking but to answer your questions, yeah, the <dq>soul crushing<dq> reputation that such architecture has isn<sq>t just because they were bad architecture. There is a bit of good design like the prototype [Unite d<sq>Habitation](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit<percent>C3<percent>A9_d<percent>27Habitation), or the early superblock [Karl Marx-Hof](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx-Hof).  Modernist planning failed because they are high density, highly centralized, socially isolating, culturally alienating, impersonal, inflexible, and in general not conducive to any vibrant urban life. </p>",

Only the middle-class and fragments of the labour aristocracy earned enough to enable women to avoid work.

Part of the reason why women were employed was because they could be paid considerably less [figure two gives it as around 1/4 compared to male salaries]. Similarly with children and immigrants. Indeed many early strikes [mid/late 19thC.] by men tended to be against women and/or immigrants insofar as they undercut wages. The gendering of women<sq>s life meant that it was more fragmented [i.e. leaving work to have children etc.] and more exhaustive [expected to do household labour as well], yet before mass education [Britain 1870s], children would be expected to join their parents at work [mills, mines, as servants etc.] - though of course not all women married \u2013 to bolster the family wage.^3<br><br>**EDIT** So in a round-about way, yes. Women were/are historically paid less than men, and this enables employers to undercut the male wage.

Race aside, this meant that a large chunk of the tax base was leaving the city, although still working and taking advantage of amenities in the city (and thus still using the infrastructure, often with a diminished input to the tax revenue of the municipality). The racial aspect is that post desegregation, minorities who had previously been excluded from neighborhoods could now move around, but often did not have the resources to follow wealthier families to the suburbs.<br><br>Gentrification, on the other hand, is when a community or neighborhood population is replaced. Typically gentrification is used to refer to poorer and/or minority populations being replaced by more affluent, often white families and individuals. When this term first came to be used in planning and economic development literature, gentrification was considered a positive trend, something cities would actively seek in order to increase the municipal tax base. The problems with gentrification, however, began to be pointed out by the populations that were being forced out of their neighborhoods. Typically housing values increase, meaning that rent will increase or new residents purchase homes that were for rent but then move into them; this forces renters out. The increase in housing values also causes property taxes to increase, which can force home-owners out, especially those living on fixed incomes, like the elderly. A further problem is that newcomers often have different expectations about what is acceptable behavior in a neighborhood, and this can cause conflicts between long-term residents and gentrifiers. [Here is a piece about some of these issues]( http<colon>//www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/gentrification-in-black-and-white/2012/01/26/gIQA2qmqnQ_story.html). A further problem is that residents who are forced out may have been living there because they could afford it, and now they have to move somewhere that is in even worse condition because that is all they can afford. This also tends to split up communities, when former residents move to many different places; these communities tend to be very important social and economic support, particularly for low-income groups that do not have the sorts of transportation and other resources that the middle class does. <br></p>",

This is certainly closest to the original use of right/left wing to distinguish royalists from those advocating for greater popular control in government during the French revolution.<br><br>But in addition to the distribution of political power, the right/left distinction has also come to be used to describe the distribution of *economic* power. That is, attitudes which favor state intervention to ensure a more equal distribution of wealth have come to be described as left-wing, and more free-market attitudes as right-wing.<br><br>A useful way to reframe the issue you<sq>ve brought up is to say that left/right wing refers to these economic attitudes, while authoritarian/liberal (or perhaps democratic) refers to attitudes toward political power and tradition. The important point being that attitudes toward the distribution of economic and political power can be treated as independent (putting aside the fact that in reality these two kinds of power are generally correlated).  <br><br>Looked at in this way, right and left wing authoritarianism need not describe different personality types, just different economic policies followed by regimes who are supported for similar reasons (e.g. fear, anxiety about change). On the other hand, this provides the most straightforward framework for answering your question about whether there might be <dq>a specific <sq>anti-authoritarianism<sq> personality that could be find both in left wing and libertarian movements?<dq> This would be the <dq>liberal/democratic<dq> personality type which is not inherently right or left wing (economically speaking). What you describe as libertarian and left wing movements would share this personality type, so both would be against concentrated and hierarchical political power. But they would have different attitudes toward the concentration of economic power. <br><br>With that said, there is ample research within political psychology on what might be called liberal or democratic character traits, which are the most meaningful foil for authoritarian personality traits. A classic text along these lines is Lasswell<sq>s [Democratic Character](http<colon>//www.policysciences.org/classics/democratic_character.pdf).

The following is from research by the Brookings Institution regarding how the white working class used to vote for Democrats until the 60s and 70s (the emphasis in bold is my own)<colon><br><br>>Democrats could therefore connect more positively to the white working by speaking <br>convincingly about the need to provide economic security to expand opportunity. Efforts <br>to increase health coverage and contain <br>health-care costs (including the cost of <br>prescription drugs), to improve the quality and availability of child care, to defend and <br>extend guaranteed retirement benefits (including Social Security), to<br> provide middle-class <br>families with strong incentives to save and build wealth, and to make college and <br>specialized training available <br>to all are the subjects of countless and competing policy <br>prescriptions. But it is critical that these <br>policies be put in the context of helping <br>Americans get ahead. **These are measures that could allow the typical white working <br>class family to raise its head from the day-to-day struggle in an insecure world and <br>concentrate on its most heartfelt wish<br><colon> to achieve the American Dream.**  <br><br><br>>**And there is no doubt that the white working class still believes it <br>is feasible to<br> attain this <br>goal.**  In a March 2006 Greenberg Quinlan Rosner/Economic Resliency Group <br>(GQR/ERG) poll, 69 percent of white working <br>class respondents said they had already <br>attained the American Dream or <br>would attain it in<br> their lifetimes<br>37.  An interesting <br>perspective on this optimism is provided by <br>looking at another question in the ERG poll <br>on whether increasing uncertainty or achieving the American Dream characterizes the <br>economy today and comparing respondents\u2019 answers to their views on whether they <br>themselves would achieve the American <br>Dream.  Here is the choice posed by the <br>uncertainty question<colon> <br><br>>1.<br>Most people today face increasing uncertainty about employment, <br>with stagnant incomes, paying more for health care, taxes, and <br>retirement, while those at the t<br>op have booming incomes and lower <br>taxes. <br><br>>2.<br>Our economy faces ups and downs, but most people can expect to <br>better themselves, see rising incomes, find good jobs and provide <br>economic security for their families. The American dream is very <br>much alive. <br><br><br>>By almost 2<colon>1 (63 percent to 32 percent), <br>white working class respondents selected the <br>first statement about increasing <br>uncertainty as coming closer to<br> their views. But of that <br>group that said that increasing uncertainty, <br>rather than achieving the American Dream, <br>26<br>characterized the economy, an amazing 60 <br>percent nevertheless thought that they <br>themselves would achieve the Dream. <br>**The GOP, for its part, has been more successful in connecting to white working class <br>aspirations than to its very real economic difficulties.  There has been a tendency to deny <br>these difficulties on the one hand and on the other to insist that the magic of the market, <br>spurred on by tax cuts, will solve whatever minor difficulties there might be.** <br><br> >This reflexively anti-government approach may have reached its limits at the current time, as a <br>restless white working class finds more and <br>more to like in the Democrats\u2019 economic <br>approach. <br><br><br><br><br>Basically faith in the American Dream + the GOP<sq>s ability to convince them that they can help them achieve the American Dream by allowing the <dq>market to do its job<dq>. <br>______________________________<br><br><br>Source<colon> https<colon>//www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/04_demographics_teixeira.pdf</p>",

Between 2001 and 2010, less than 8 percent of mass murder offenders in the U.S. were women, she says, adding that some of the women included in the statistics assisted in a crime but did not pull a trigger.<br><br>In part, Huff-Corzine says, <dq>this may be explained by women<sq>s weapons of choice even when they do want to do serious bodily harm to someone.

The simplest you could say is Male & Female biology is different.  We have different hormones and chemical differences that seem to make most men more prone to violence then most women.  There are also plenty of societal aspects to the issue.  Young men are much more likely to see examples of men committing violence and being rewarded for it in popular culture.  One could also argue that violence in men was naturally selected for in the thousands of years before what we would call modern society.  Being violent often would have been a benefit to survival and as such most modern men still have that capacity.  It<sq>s probably a combination of these reasons and quite a few more.</p>",

The original comment tried to equate unemployment to poverty and that is what I addressed. Sorry if it<sq>s out of context but here it is. <br><br>____________________________________________________________<br><br>>That<sq>s my case for the economic impossibility of capitalism getting everyone out of poverty.<br><br>You haven<sq>t made this case at all. All you<sq>ve done is argue that you cannot achieve 100<percent> employment. The question was whether poverty could be eliminated, not whether everyone could be employed. First, you haven<sq>t defined poverty and second being unemployed doesn<sq>t automatically mean you are poor. <br><br>What exactly is <dq>poverty<dq>? <br><br>What constitutes <dq>poverty<dq> in one place could be considered extremely wealthy in another. For example, even the poorest working adult in the United States would be considered fabulously wealthy by the citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The poor in the US have cell phones, flat screen TV<sq>s, cars, new clothes, they have access to quality medical care (though that access is somewhat difficult to get, but far easier to obtain than in Congo), and clean water. If you were to rank the world poor even the poorest people in the United States would still fare better than most people in many parts of the world. When you talk about <dq>poverty<dq> you have to actually define what it means to be in poverty. Just saying someone is <dq>poor<dq> is misleading. You could easily make the argument that no longer being considered <dq>poor<dq> was having a house to live in, clean drinking water, food to eat, basic sanitation, etc. Just because you can<sq>t buy new flat screen TV every year doesn<sq>t mean you are poor.<br><br>Unemployment is also a poor ruler for measuring poverty. If you were earning $500,000 a year and then suddenly lost your job that doesn<sq>t mean you suddenly joined the ranks of the Congolese who live in real and abject poverty. Nor would that logic hold true if you were a minimum wage worker who lost their job. You<sq>ve simply become unemployed and unemployment is often temporary. Wealth is more than just a paycheck but rather an accumulation of stuff, assets, savings, and access to basic human needs such as food, clean water, proper sanitation, housing, etc. You cannot define poverty as being unemployed.<br><br>You also make the assumption that just <dq>employing<dq> people will pull them out of poverty, which is not a flawed assumption, it<sq>s a patently false one to make. Nearly everyone in Cuba has a job working for the state but it<sq>s one of the poorest nations in the world. Everyone in North Korea works for the state as well but they certainly aren<sq>t considered wealthy. If you employed everyone in the United States and paid them minimum wage you<sq>d have full employment but you wouldn<sq>t eliminate the problem of relative poverty in the country. In the United States there are plenty of minimum wage workers who will never get above the official poverty line in their entire lives. By US standards they are poor, but by world standards they are part of the wealthy 1<percent>.<br><br>You cannot use poorly defined words and false assumptions to make an argument and claim it is a valid one. Your sly critique of capitalism is based on what you admitted was a <dq>flawed assumption.<dq> In reality capitalism (or rather freer markets) has pulled people out of poverty far more than any other economic system. Even the social democratic wonderlands of Europe are only *slightly* socialistic philosophically and economically. While they may have socialized their welfare programs the heart of their economies is still highly capitalistic. In places where the state controls all of the means of production you routinely see much greater levels of poverty. <dq>Communist<dq> China was an extremely poor place until market reforms ushered in a new era of economic growth. China opened up its economy and adopted more, dare I say, capitalist policies, and it<sq>s economy has rocketed to the number two spot in the world. It only took [20 years of market reforms in China] (https<colon>//openknowledge.worldbank.com/bitstream/handle/10986/14241/WPS3408.pdf?sequence=1) to reduce their poverty rate from 53<percent> in 1981 to just 8<percent> in 2001. That is a staggering number when you stop and think about it. <br><br>My brief answer to OP<sq>s question would be yes and no. Yes, it is possible to bring everyone out of abject absolute poverty, but no it is not possible to erase relative poverty completely. Nor can you assume that just because someone is in relative poverty today that they will remain so in the future. Most college students would be considered poor but most college graduates do not remain poor their entire life. As they get older, work longer, and acquire more experience they will rise above poverty and enter the ranks of the middle class. Some, depending on their field, will become wealthy by the end of their working lives. You are always going to have <dq>poor<dq> people in the relative sense. It could be because of lifestyle choices, educational choices, disease or injury, their willingness to work and possibly a dozen other things. What you should focus on is not whether relative poverty can be eliminated (which it cannot, but absolute poverty can) but rather how easily it is to climb the socioeconomic ladder to rise out of poverty to join the middle class or wealthy. </p>",

In essence, they were the same town. My elementary and high school were roughly 50<percent> white and 50<percent> first nations.<br><br>As many other people have mentioned, residential schools and poor treatment of first nations in the past has left their culture in a state of shock. On the reserve, alchohlism is hugely prevalent. <br><br>12 children out of my 290 person high school had fetal alcohol syndrome, and all of them were first nations. <br><br>My family owned a coffee shop right beside the liquor store in town. Every day natives would walk from the reserve, (6 km and then 6km back) to buy booze. Being a small town you knew all their names, you<sq>d say hi as they passed every day.<br><br>Often times drunk first nations people would lie down in front of our store, because they knew we would eventually call the cops. They would then thank us for calling them a ride home. The police wouldn<sq>t throw them in the drunk tank, they knew the first nations people on first name basis as well.<br><br>Half of my friends from kindergarten to grade 12 were first nations. Compared to non-aboriginals, on average they did far worse in school. Many of them failed consecutive grades in high school and never graduated.<br><br>There were some first nations I grew up with who are attaining further education, but the ratio compared to non-aboriginals is abysmal. As white university student who comes from a low income family, it hurts me somewhat to see the opportunities my first nations friends had available but never took. They got money based on their high school grades. Their band sponsered them to go to university, often covering the entirety of tuition.<br><br>On a different note, being on the reserve is always interesting. Due to poor upkeep, and somewhat frequent floods, many houses on the reserve were in poor poor condition. Trailers that looked like they would fall apart. These were the houses given to reserve residents by the band/government. Technically the occupants down own their houses, so it<sq>s much the same as renting, but the owner has no real incentive to keep the place nice.<br><br>However, infront of many trailers/houses is a $50,000 SUV, a satellite dish, and you know your friend Jim just got the new Xbox one on release day.<br><br>Finally, there are separate tribal police, with their own vehicles. The RCMP, while they are legally allowed to be police on the reserve, will generally leave all reserve calls for the tribal police. Many times I have seen first nations flat out refuse to listen to the RCMP, but comply immediately when tribal police show up. It<sq>s in interesting dynamic and I<sq>m never quite sure what to make of it.<br><br>I know this answer has no citations, which is wrong for r/asksocialsience, and if it must be taken down then that<sq>s that. However I hope this has given you some insight as to what I grew up with.<br><br>TL;DR<colon> Growing up with first nations is unique and interesting and highly alters an individuals perception of them due to first hand experience of aboriginal problems.</p>",

A poor parent may work several jobs or jobs at strange hours (blue collar work), removing or restricting opportunities to help their children with homework that a white collar, 9-to-5, parent may have.[This grad paper pretty much covers it in simple terms.](http<colon>//www2.uwstout.edu/content/lib/thesis/2011/2011horvatinl.pdf).

Another example is the tax code.

If you spend any amount of time on the Internet, you will run into people who don<sq>t understand a thing but still like to talk about it constantly. TumblrInAction goes beyond that, into the realm of actually actively searching for people who don<sq>t know what they<sq>re talking about. <br><br>Essentially what this creates, however, is a pretty straightforward straw-man producing factory. It gets to the point where people can unironically make posts like [<dq>The Equal Pay Act made the wage gap illegal<dq>](https<colon>//np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3367x6/sanity_sunday_the_equal_pay_act_made_the_wage_gap/) and they won<sq>t even see anything wrong with it. In order to even talk about academics, we<sq>d have to figure out what the people on Tumblr even believe, which is not something that I think places like TiA are really capable of doing well or accurately.<br><br>There are a lot of academic theories that *are* similar to what TiA posts about.

Finally - [most scientific consensus in the field on media effects are that they do exist](http<colon>//psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2001-17729-001), which is an unpopular notion on a lot of reddit.<br><br>I don<sq>t really know how much the social climate on Reddit or Tumblr actually says much about the rest of the world.

Its base is from all classes, but lead by the petty-bourgeoisie [this is different today, Trump and Farage, a billionaire and ex-banker, are inverse Hochstapler], especially those at risk of immiseration who under that threat are at risk of mutating national myths and thymos. Undeveloped fascists in the fallout of WW1 were first employed by western governments against the proletariat (factory occupations Italy 1918-21, British general strike, [German revolution](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918<percent>E2<percent>80<percent>9319), Spain 1920s etc.) gaining a sense of themselves and a legitimacy against <sq>the real threat<sq> [i.e. communism]. 1914-1945 was an era of European civil war, [as crisis<sq>s hit](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1917<percent>E2<percent>80<percent>9323) the competition of imperial powers and then reverberated across the very fabric of our total social reality. Fascism in many ways was an attempt to reassert meaning on a world that had become meaningless by the awesome power of technology in war. This weltlosigkeit is reflected throughout the culture of the period, most notably in modern art [futurism and fragments of dada famously linked to fascism]. The choice became Red Vienna or Black Vienna. As the revolutionary left was crushed, much of its support fell right-wards under a sentiment of the times which was both the cause and consequence of such a crushing. The last gasp of the independent left was the international brigades in 36<sq>, in which legions died, and Stalin gave up on a lone anti-fascism and became neutral and then collaborator and then opponent, to fascists, phases followed, in a different order, by all major western liberal states of the era.<br><br>It should be obvious that the material conditions for fascism, on one level, do not exist at all, and this plays out in the new forms. It<sq>s not unimportant that the classic fascist states, Italy and Germany, were also the most recent European nations, and thus their national identity simultaneously more open and violent [in a way the cost of catching up with the rest in the imperialist project]. What doesn<sq>t exist today compared to the era of fascism then<colon><br><br>* there<sq>s no strong radical left<br><br>* this populist movement has yet to gain any sort of establishment support, there<sq>s no decaying aristocracy or monarchical order with power, national ethos and empire has been - even in the imperial centres - watered down under the pressure of international capital who<sq>s face is multicultural and cosmopolitan. Nevertheless many ruling-elites^1 talk as Doblin did about Berlin in 1929, as *sodom on the eve of its destruction* and have become quite hopeless, their consciousness having failed to keep pace with their development<br><br>* there<sq>s no formulated ideology. remember that fascism was not nationalism or conservatism, but modernity *par excellence*, not only in terms of using of new media, but in a vision of the future, of a new man or new state. fascism always posed itself *against* the degeneracy of bourgeois culture, that would be cleansed by blood and fire in a capitalism without class conflict. Hints of this exists today, but it<sq>s incoherent, and predictably bears the barcode of postmodernity.<br><br>* no perspective on art. remember fascists have their own complex [aesthetics](https<colon>//ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/walter-benjamin-fascism-crisis/) and symbolism, and oppose themselves to <dq>degenerate art<dq>. Art movements have died [compared to 1920s] so this is predictably absent today. What does exists, dark memes?<br><br>* no street movement, no dual power. Predictably given the absence of the left.

There<sq>s a widespread perception that the social sciences are <dq>soft<dq>, i.e. less rigorous and legitimate than <dq>hard<dq> natural science. It<sq>s hard to pin down the reasons for this (in actuality there aren<sq>t any non-trivial methodological differences that stand up to scrutiny). One idea I like is that the social scientific knowledge, being about humans, almost always intersects with some aspect of people<sq>s everyday experience. This creates something of a Catch 22<colon> when a social scientists<sq> conclusions agree with common knowledge, they<sq>re vulnerable to being accused of <dq>stating the obvious<dq> (which might be true \u2013 but they<sq>ve stated it with scientific validity that wasn<sq>t there before); when they add complexity to or contradict common knowledge, they<sq>re overcomplicating things people think they already understand perfectly well. A similar quandary arises with social scientists<sq> use of language<colon> if they borrow words from everyday speech (<dq>culture<dq>, <dq>gender<dq>), the technical meaning will inevitably diverge from the vernacular one and cause confusion. If they coin new ones (<dq>dialectic<dq>, <dq>normative<dq>), they<sq>re using unnecessary^* jargon for things that can be described well enough in plain English. Or it could just be that the social sciences (on the whole) are younger than the natural sciences, produce less tangible results or have worse career prospects if you study them at college.<br><br>Whatever the reason, the effect is that when engaging with the public social scientists have to establish their right to claim to speak authoritatively about their subject in a way that natural scientists don<sq>t. When Neil deGrasse Tyson starts talking about the structure of the universe, I have no doubt that I should be listening. I don<sq>t know anything about galaxies and superclusters; he<sq>s a scientist talking about a domain of knowledge over which science has an exclusive claim. If, on the other hand, a social scientist came on my TV and started talking about the structure of race in the United States, all sorts of questions would start popping into my head. Why is she claiming to know things I don<sq>t? I grew up in America, I know what race is. She<sq>s saying things that fly in the face of my everyday experience \u2013 that race is <dq>socially constructed<dq> (I<sq>m not even sure what <dq>socially constructed<dq> means) \u2013 how could that possibly be true? Does she have a political angle, and do I agree with it? (Social science is much more likely to have implications on political policy than natural science, which is always going to cause scepticism \u2013 just look at climate science.) There are many competing voices that claim to have knowledge about how society works and why people behave the way they do \u2013 politicians, religious authorities, and, not least, <dq>common sense<dq>.<br><br>Science isn<sq>t authorative to all people on all things, of course, which gives us a good illustration of the difficulties in engaging with the public as a social scientist. Imagine trying to make a documentary on the Big Bang or evolution for an audience of biblical literalist Christians, or on anthropogenic climate change for an audience of climate change denialists. It<sq>s not impossible, but you<sq>d have to devote much of your time to establishing how you know what you<sq>re know and addressing common misunderstandings. Those are extreme examples, but social scientists are always presenting their work to a mildly sceptical audience when they engage with the public, and I think that makes it very difficult for a <dq>definitive<dq> documentary series on social science to exist. The people who made Cosmos have the luxury of being able to inform the public about how the universe works and have their authority taken for granted.<br><br>-----<br>^* Unnecessary being the key word. I<sq>m not going to pretend that many, perhaps the majority, of social scientists don<sq>t overuse jargon or otherwise write appalling prose. But so do many natural scientists. The difference is that nobody blinks an eye when natural scientists coin jargon to refer to new phenomena (supernovas, hydrogen), but there is a pervasive attitude that social science jargon is inherently meaningless.</p>",

The first and biggest Scientologist Celebrity Centre is in Hollywood, though there are now several others.  There<sq>s even a Scientology magazine called just *Celebrity*.  Lawrence Wright<sq>s *Going Clear<colon> Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief* is probably the best, most up-to-date book on the subject (there are now several good books on Scientology though)--it rose out of his pretty famous article on the screenwriter and director Paul Haggis (*Milliion Dollar Baby*, *Crash*) called [<dq>Paul Haggis vs. the Church of Scientology<dq>](http<colon>//www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all). To quote the relevant parts of the original article<colon><br><br>>In 1955, a year after the church\u2019s founding, an affiliated publication urged Scientologists to cultivate celebrities<colon> \u201cIt is obvious what would happen to Scientology if prime communicators benefitting from it would mention it.\u201d At the end of the sixties, the church established its first Celebrity Centre, in Hollywood. (There are now satellites in Paris, Vienna, D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich, Florence, London, New York, Las Vegas, and Nashville.) Over the next decade, Scientology became a potent force in Hollywood. In many respects, Haggis was typical of the recruits from that era, at least among those in the entertainment business. Many of them were young and had quit school in order to follow their dreams, but they were also smart and ambitious. The actress Kirstie Alley, for example, left the University of Kansas in 1970, during her sophomore year, to get married. Scientology, she says, helped her lose her craving for cocaine. \u201cWithout Scientology, I would be dead,\u201d she has said.<br><br>>In 1975, the year that Haggis became a Scientologist, John Travolta, a high-school dropout, was making his first movie, \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Rain,\u201d in Durango, Mexico, when an actress on the set gave him a copy of \u201cDianetics.\u201d \u201cMy career immediately took off,\u201d he told a church publication. \u201cScientology put me into the big time.\u201d The testimonials of such celebrities have attracted many curious seekers. In Variety, Scientology has advertised courses promising to help aspiring actors \u201cmake it in the industry.\u201d [...]<br><br>>Many Hollywood actors were drawn into the church by a friend or by reading \u201cDianetics\u201d; a surprising number of them, though, came through the Beverly Hills Playhouse. For decades, the resident acting coach there was Milton Katselas, and he taught hundreds of future stars, including Ted Danson, Michelle Pfeiffer, and George Clooney. \u201cMost of Hollywood went through that class,\u201d Anne Archer told me. In 1974, two years after her son Tommy Davis was born, she began studying with Katselas. She was a young mother in a dissolving marriage, coming off a television series (\u201cBob & Carol & Ted & Alice\u201d) that had been cancelled after one season. Katselas had a transformative effect. She recalled discussions \u201cabout life, people, and behavior,\u201d and said that Katselas \u201csaid some things in class that were really smart.\u201d Some of the other students told her that Katselas was a Scientologist, so she began the Life Repair program at the Celebrity Centre. \u201cI went two or three times a week, probably for a couple of weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember walking out of the building and walking down the street toward my car and I felt like my feet were not touching the ground. And I said to myself, \u2018My God, this is the happiest I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life. I\u2019ve finally found something that works.\u2019 \u201d She added, \u201cLife didn\u2019t seem so hard anymore. I was back in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d<br><br>>Jim Gordon, a veteran police officer in Los Angeles, and also an aspiring actor, spent ten years at the Playhouse, starting in 1990. He told me that Scientology \u201crecruited a ton of kids out of that school.\u201d Like Scientology, the Playhouse presented a strict hierarchy of study; under Katselas\u2019s tutelage, students graduated from one level to the next. As Gordon advanced within the Playhouse, he began recognizing many students from the roles they were getting in Hollywood. \u201cYou see a lot of people you know from TV,\u201d Gordon says. He began feeling the pull of the church. \u201cWhen you started off, they weren\u2019t really pushing it, but as you progressed through the Playhouse\u2019s levels Scientology became more of a focus,\u201d he told me. After a few years, he joined. Like the courses at the Playhouse, Scientology offered actors a method that they could apply to both their lives and their careers.<br><br>>Not long after Gordon became a Scientologist, he was asked to serve as an \u201cethics officer\u201d at the Playhouse, monitoring the progress of other students and counselling those who were having trouble. He was good at pinpointing students who were struggling. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like picking out the wounded chicks,\u201d he says. He sometimes urged a student to meet with the senior ethics officer at the Playhouse, a Scientologist who often recommended courses at the Celebrity Centre. \u201cMy job was to keep the students active and make sure they were not being suppressed,\u201d Gordon says. In the rhetoric of Scientology, \u201csuppressive persons\u201d\u2014or S.P.s\u2014block an individual\u2019s spiritual progress. Implicitly, the message to the students was that success awaited them if only they could sweep away the impediments to stardom, including S.P.s. Katselas received a ten-per-cent commission from the church on the money contributed by his students.<br><br>>Katselas died in 2008, and Scientology no longer has a connection with the Beverly Hills Playhouse. Anne Archer told me that the reputation of Katselas\u2019s class as, in Gordon\u2019s words, a \u201cScientology clearinghouse\u201d is overblown. \u201cHis classes averaged about fifty or sixty people, and there would be maybe seven to ten people in it who would be Scientologists,\u201d she says. But the list of Scientologists who have studied at the Playhouse is long\u2014it includes Jenna Elfman, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jason Lee\u2014and the many prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Katselas left behind helped cement the relationship between Hollywood and the church.<br><br>The whole article is worth reading if you<sq>re interested in Scientology, as is the book (though I haven<sq>t finished the book). The short answer is because they very effectively recruiting from Hollywood, especially in the 70<sq>s when people were more likely to be <dq>searching<dq>, got to people before they got famous, and provided a loving, supportive community for them while they were <dq>starving artists<dq>. As Paul Haggis writes about living in a run-down hotel full of Scientologists in the early 70<sq>s, <dq>I had a little apartment with a kitchen I could write in,<dq> he recalls. <dq>There was a feeling of camaraderie that was something I\u2019d never experienced\u2014all these atheists looking for something to believe in, and all these loners looking for a club to join.<dq><br><br>Once they begin to get famous, the perks change.  <br><br>>Haggis\u2019s experience in Scientology, though, was hardly egalitarian<colon> he accepted the privileges of the Celebrity Centre, which offers notables a private entrance, a V.I.P. lounge, separate facilities for auditing, and other perks. Indeed, much of the appeal of Scientology is the overt \u00e9litism that it promotes among its members, especially celebrities. Haggis was struck by another paradox<colon> \u201cHere I was in this very structured organization, but I always thought of myself as a freethinker and an iconoclast.\u201d <br><br>Why they stay is a different matter.  Some people, like Tom Cruise, are obviously true believers.  Some people treat it like any other religion they half belong to.  There are lots of specific benefits for celebrity Scientologists, though.  There<sq>s a famous expose of Scientologists redoing Tom Cruise<sq>s entire car (like rip out all the dashes, replacing them with polished wood type stuff) while being paid essentially slave wages.  More perniciously, there are rumors that Scientology uses secrets to keep its celebrities in line.  The Scientological process of auditing basically involves telling someone all of your secrets.  Many celebrities have things they don<sq>t want to get out (one scientology enthusiast I talked to years ago said that it was widely believed John Travolta had homosexual experiences in the 70<sq>s he doesn<sq>t want to get out, for example).  Even without the explicit leaking of secrets, becoming a <dq>suppressed person<dq> is no joke (you may lose all your friends and if your partner is in the church, them and your children even) so, once someone is in, it would take a lot of energy to overcome the inertia of just staying in.<br><br>Read the whole Wright article on Paul Haggis though.  It<sq>s good.  If you want to know more about Scientology, generally the *Village Voice* had the best coverage for most of the past decade because one of its writers/editors became very interested in the subject.  Breeze through their [archives](http<colon>//www.villagevoice.com/related/to/Scientology/), but sadly the person who wrote most of those articles, Tony Ortega, has since moved on.  Luckily, he now has a [blog entirely devoted to the subject](http<colon>//tonyortega.org/).</p>",

If you look into the backers of the Olympics you will often find the titans of the urban land industry supporting the whole ordeal.<br><br>In regards to the Olympics being bad for the economy, I generally agree. Very few Olympics produced an actual surplus in either the short or long term. Calgary and Los Angeles are the only two games which came close to producing a direct economic benefit. Games like Montreal and Athens had crippling economic costs. Some people go so far as to say that you can trace many of Greece<sq>s current problems to the handling of their games (Beriatos 2004)! However, in a broader scope, the Olympics bring numerous economic multipliers, infrastructure, and other things that amortize over time. As such its very hard to gauge the economic impact of the event. Does an increase in tourism because of the infrastructure built during the Olympics make them worth while? What if that infrastructure attracted businesses and other people to the city? How do you calculate the value of every hotel, restaurant and bar being at capacity for almost a month? What if the spirit of Olympianism permeates the culture of the city causing obesity rates to drop, or volunteerism becomes popular? <br><br>You are absolutely right to say that the Olympics affect different classes differently. Greene (2003) wrote on how the Olympics often lead to slum clearance. Ley (2008) and Shaw (2008) discuss the potential for The Olympics to spur gentrification processes. Eisinger (2000) discusses the problems of building a city for the visitor class.

It has been dragged out in the open by recent legislative acts, but they are widely considered failed attempts at quasi-fascist populism by the regime (the regime is searching for a new ideological direction after 2011-2012 elections, which saw largest protests in modern Russian history occur). <br><br>Attitudes towards homosexuality are negative, but rarely aggressive. This is the norm for developing countries such as Russia.

                "answer": "<p>You have to understand first that communist countries considered (as stated by Marx) a religion <sq>opiate for the masses<sq> and as anti-revolutionary (edit<colon> stated by Lenin). So there was strong anti-religious sentiment by state apparatus by default.  <br><br>Also, what you have to understand that Orthodox Christianity as denomination of Christianity  is a bit different from Catholicism. I am not talking about religious dogma (which has its differences), but the administrative rule. Unlike Catholicism that has centralize rule  - Rome with the Pope  -  Orthodoxy has decentralized administrative rule. Basically each <sq>Orthodox kingdom<sq> had its own Patriarchate.  As such, eventually the Church (or rather Orthodoxy) became also the national identity throughout Orthodox Christendom. <br><br>Furthermore, Russian Orthodox Church  was close to the Tzar. or rather Church was the part of the Russian ruling elite and Church played integral role in <sq>oppressing the workers and peasants<sq> . So, after revolution in 1917 when Bolsheviks took power they basically considered Russian Orthodox Church as a Tzar legacy, so to speak. The civil war that followed after revolution, didn<sq>t help as well.  Church took sides with <dq>Whites<sq> (one might argue they were Russian nationalists, but essentially they were anti-blosheviks) while the Reds were Bolsheviks. Reds of course won. You also have to consider that communist suppressed not only  religion but also a nationalistic sentiments as nationalism is also seen as anti-revolutionary as it didn<sq>t promote the union of workers but nation(s). Lenin him self promoted internationalism which is in direct conflict with nationalism . From wiki <dq> Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks were officially opposed to nationalism as being reactionary, a bourgeois creation, and contrary to the interests of proletarian class struggle and communist revolution<dq><br><br>Enter Stalin era where Church leaders and Church itself was further oppressed. Clergy and many believers were shot or send to camps. So, in essence being religious in communist Russia was big <dq>no-no<dq>, never-mind the fact that you might be a believer.  It<sq>s like if /r/atheism on steroids took power. Furthermore Stalin promoted [Soviet nationalism](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_socialist_patriotism) as a way to unite the whole Sovient Union (that had different nations, cultures, etc) This still however denied <sq>individual nationalism<sq> (e.g. Russian, Georgian, Ukrainian) instead it was a collective nationalism (or rather socialist patriotism, that put essence in social struggle of soviet people)<br><br>Edit<colon> worth to mention Church and religion itself was never forbidden, but it was put under state control. As such the [Orthodox Church outside Russia](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church_Outside_Russia) as a True Orthodox Russian Church was formed. (Still, I think they try to reconcile with todays Church in Russia, as they still see it as state apparatus)<br><br><br>Now enter 1990, collapse of USSR and soviet block. Throughout the whole soviet block the emergence of suppressed  nationalism arose. Countries start to break away from unions <colon> some violently (see war in Balkans,) some non violently ( Ukraine, Georgia,  Belorussia, etc) As a way to prove their patriotic nationalistic sentiments people flogged back to Churches. They saw  Church as a way to affirm their <dq>Russianness<dq>. In other words - because of decades of suppressed cultural and national identity people saw the Church as way to reclaim their lost identity as a nation (see before mentioned Orthodoxy Patriarchy rule) . They were not communist anymore ,  now they were Russians. Orthodox Russians for that matter.<br><br>Now, homophobia is different topic altogether, although Church play its role today, the anti-gay sentiment was also present in communist era. Juts because they were atheist that doesn<sq>t mean they had pro atheist agenda we think of today. Besides abortion for example, homosexuality in Soviet Union was considered immoral  - it was forbidden and it was punishable by hard labor and prison by Stalin. Later, after Stalin,  homosexuality was <sq>liberalized<sq> (you would not be shot)  but still forbidden.  So the homophobia  in Russia today is the combination of the Soviet legacy, Church dogma and to make it worse it is also seen as a Western cultural influence, which is in conflict with rising nationalism. So,  LGBT population in Russia today have really  bad combo that they have to fight against.<br><br><br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>As lots of folks have pointed out, the idea of waves is only useful insofar as it gives a broad, yet fictional, description of the history of feminism. [Linda Nicholson argues](http<colon>//newpol.org/content/feminism-waves-useful-metaphor-or-not) that the usfulness of the wave metaphor for contemporary feminism (therefor, the usefulness of the term <dq>third wave<dq>) has elapsed. <br><br>> During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, feminism began to expand its meaning, including not only those who supported what many now think of as a liberal understanding of feminism, but also those who took this worldview in new directions. The 1960s through the 1980s was a period of great theoretical and political creativity and activity, making possible a very broad understanding of feminism. But after that kind of creative activity began to die down in the 1990s, people began to wonder whether or not we were in a third wave of feminism. The appeal of this way of thinking was that it kept up the hope that gender activism had not really died down but merely had taken a somewhat different, more youthful and jazzier form. But when I think about what has transpired in the period from the 1990s to today, I don<sq>t think that the metaphor of a third wave is the best way to describe what has gone on.<br><br>What happened, basically, is that there are a lot of very different trajectories and projects under the heading <dq>feminism,<dq> which makes the description of <dq>third wave<dq> misleading. (I would even argue that <dq>second wave<dq> is only narrowly useful to describe new activism that took place immediately after 1919.) There is <dq>too much<dq> feminism for there to be a <dq>third wave.<dq>  And because a lot of this feminism is <dq>still in progress,<dq> trying to parse out what the <dq>third<dq> (or for some, <dq>fourth<dq>) wave is not really a smart project.<br><br>A good example of the trouble that gets going with wave definitions can be seen in various attempts to highlight *the break* third wave feminism made from second wave. For some, the break occurred when feminists resisted or rejected gender/sex essentialism. Others say it is when race and sexuality entered the feminist equation. Some say it<sq>s sex-positivity, other postmodernism. What is remarkable is how many of these things highlighted are about us, *now*, rejecting or distancing ourselves from a previous generation of feminists. The second wave, in so many words, becomes a repository for the sins of <dq>other<dq> feminists, and its role as demarcating the historical turns in feminism obscures the diversity in (crypto)feminism before and after the start of the <dq>third wave.<dq> *Before*, because it very often paints second-wave feminist all of the same stripe, and *after* because it makes it seem like those <dq>sins of the foremothers<dq> are in the past.<br><br>**Keeping all that in mind,** lol, I recommend that if you<sq>re conversing with folks over reddit (or anywhere), and they seem to make some pretty broad or confusing claims<colon> ask for clarification. That is to say, ask *who* said *X*, *what* they think *X* means, and if its second hand, *where* they<sq>re getting their interpretation of *X*. Very often, it is in the details we will find the devils, whether fictions or real. Lots of feminists have lots of very different ideas, so know who they are and how they<sq>ve articulated their selves is important to figure out what<sq>s going on.<br><br>Another thing is to pay attention to terms and arguments.

I don\u2019t have much time for Marx\u2019s utopian vision of socialism nor his labour theory of value, but his understanding of capitalism was superior in many ways to those of the self-appointed advocates of capitalism. For example, when free-market economists were mostly against limited liability companies, Marx saw it as an institution that will take capitalism on to another plane (to take it eventually to socialism, in his mistaken view). In my view, 150 years after he wrote it, his analysis of the evolution of labour regulation in Britain in Capital vol. 1 still remains one of the best on the subject. Marx also understood the centrality of the interaction between technologies (or what he called the forces of production) and institutions (or what he called the relations of production), which other economic schools have only recently started to grapple with.<br><br>http<colon>//hajoonchang.net/economists-who-have-influenced-me/</p>",

Wood<colon><br><br>>...the distinctive and dominant characteristic of the capitalist market is not opportunity of choice, but on the contrary, compulsion. Material life and social reproduction in capitalism are universally mediated by the market, so that all individuals must in one way or another enter into the market to gain access to the means of life. This unique system of market dependence means that the dictates of the capitalist market \u2013its imperatives of competition, accumulation, profit-maximization, and increasing labour-productivity \u2013 relegate not only all economic transactions but social relations in general. As relations among human beings are mediated by the process of commodity exchange, social relations among people appear as relations among things.<br><br>Ellen Wood, *The Origins of Capitalism<colon> A Longer View* (New York<colon> Monthly Review Press, 1999), 7.<br><br>And this was created with tremendous violence, and this idea is at the core of Marxist thinking (along with HM, but that<sq>s a different post).

                "answer": "<p>Brad Delong, not a Marxist sympathizer, wrote the following<colon><br><br>>Marx the economist--well, Marx the economist had six big things to say, some of which are very valuable even today across more than a century and a half, and some of which are not. I would call them the three goods and the three bads<colon><br><br>>Marx the economist was among the very first to recognize that the fever-fits of financial crisis and depression that afflict modern market economies were not a passing phase or something that could be easily cured, but rather a deep disability of the system--as we are being reminded once again right now, this time with Ben Bernanke, Tim Geithner, and Larry Summers in the Hot Seats. Marx pointed the spotlight in the right direction here. However, I don<sq>t think that his theory of business cycles and financial crises holds up. Marx thought that business cycles and financial crises were evidence of the long-term unsustainability of the system. We modern neoliberal economists view it not as a fatal lymphoma but rather like malaria<colon> Keynesianism--or monetarism, if you prefer--gives us the tools to transform the business cycle from a life- threatening economic yellow fever of the society into the occasional night sweats and fevers<colon> that with economic policy quinine we can manage if not banish the disease.<br><br>>Marx the economist was among the very first to get the industrial revolution right<colon> to understand what it meant for human possibilities and the human destiny in a sense that people like Adam Smith did not. In his Politics Aristotle observed that it was not possible to run a household in a way that permitted its head enough leisure and freedom to, say, become a lover of wisdom unless the household owned slaves, and that this would be true unless and until we had instruments like <dq>the statues of Daedalus, or the tripods of Hephaestus, which, says the poet, <sq>of their own accord entered the assembly of the Gods;<sq> if, in like manner, the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves...<dq> Karl Marx was among the very first to see that the industrial revolution was giving us the statues of Daedalus, the tripods of Hephaestus, looms that weave and lyres that play by themselves--and thus opens the possibility of a society in which we people can be lovers of wisdom without being supported by the labor of a mass of illiterate, brutalized, half-starved, and overworkedslaves.<br><br>>Marx the economist got a lot about the economic history of the development of modern capitalism in England right--not everything, but he is still very much worth grappling with as an economic historian of 1500-1850. Most important, I think, are his observations that the benefits of industrialization do take a long time--generations--to kick in, while the costs of redistributions and power grabs in the interest of market efficiency and the politically- powerful rising mercantile classes kick in immediately. You have to take seriously the idea that the industrial revolution did not make most or even many people better off right away. Reflect also that, as Tyler Cowen observes, capitalist systems can produce less autonomy than small scale production. Standards of living do rise from industrialization--which can undercut the cultures and networks of suppliers that make the choice of a petit bourgeois lifestyle sustainable.<br><br>>Now on to the three bads<colon><br><br>>Marx believed that capital is not a complement to but a substitute for labor. Thus technological progress and capital accumulation that raise average labor productivity also lower the working-class wage. Hence the market system simply could not deliver a good or half-good society but only a combination of obscene luxury and mass poverty. This is an empirical question. Marx<sq>s belief seems to me to be simply wrong.<br><br>>Marx the economist did not like the society of the cash nexus. He believed that a system that reduced people to some form of prostitution--working for wages and wages alone--was bad. He saw a society growing in which worked for money, and their real life began only when the five o\u2019clock whistle blows--and saw such an economy as an insult, delivering low utility, and also sociologically and psychologically unsustainable in the long run. Instead, he thought, people should view their jobs as expressions of their species-being<colon> ways to gain honor or professions that they were born or designed to do or as ways to serve their fellow- human. Here, I think, Marx mistook the effects of capitalism for the effects of poverty. The demand for a world in which people do things for each other purely out of beneficence rather than out of interest and incentives leads you down a very dangerous road, for societies that try to abolish the cash nexus in favor of public- spirited benevolence do not wind up in their happy place. We neoliberal economists shrug our shoulders and say that we are in favor of a market economy but not of a market society, and that there is no reason why people cannot find jobs they like or insist on differentials that compensate them for jobs they don\u2019t.<br><br>>Marx believed that the capitalist market economy was incapable of delivering an acceptable distribution of income for anything but the briefest of historical intervals. As best as I can see, he was pushed to that position by watching the French Second Republic of 1848-1851, where the ruling class comes to prefer a charismatic mountebank for a dictator--<dq>Napoleon III<dq>--over a democracy because dictatorship promises to safeguard their property in a way that democracy will not. Hence Marx saw political democracy as only surviving for as long as the rulers could pull the wool over the workers<sq> eyes, and then collapsing. I think that Western Europe over the past fifty years serves as a significant counterexample. It may be difficult to maintain a democratic capitalist market system with an acceptable distribution of income. But <dq>incapable<dq> is surely too strong. Beveridgism or Myrdalism--social democracy, progressive income taxes, a very large and well-established safety net, public education to a high standard, channels for upward mobility, and all the panoply of the twentieth-century social- democratic mixed-economy democratic state can banish all Marx\u2019s fears that capitalist prosperity must be accompanied by great inequality and great misery. <br><br>http<colon>//delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/05/understanding-karl-marx-hoisted-from-the-archives-from-four-years-ago-may-day-weblogging.html<br><br>I think what deLong says Marx got right, most people would agree with today.

Paul. He writes (2006), <br>...the rarity of mental diseases...was a direct result of the secure and stable lifestyles they enjoyed, which were the most conducive to keeping them exceptionally well-adjusted. When mental illness did occur, it bore no social stigma (p. 23).<br><br>Psychological complaints among the Mi<sq>kmaq were considered the result of unfulfilled desires; some of these cases were sexual in nature while many others were not. Once a shaman had diagnosed such an ailment the cure was effected rather simply\u2014by seeing to it that the root desire was fulfilled. In the event that this proved impossible offerings or the performance of certain rituals were employed instead. <br><br>While it is not possible to determine the historical rates of such afflictions, Paul also notes that the Mi<sq>kmaq had a much healthier view of both sex and nudity than the far more repressed Europeans. When considered in light of the psychological understanding and treatments available to the Mi<sq>kmaq it is fair to conclude that far fewer psycho-sexual issues were extant among them (Paul, 2006, p. 23,24; Choquette, 2004, p. 23). <br><br>However, one<sq>s personal sense of honour, and the esteem in which one was held within the tribe and the family, could, when offended, lead to psychological distress.

It were much better...that I die.\u201d<br>In fact, he entered into the woods singing certain mournful songs which expressed the bitterness of his heart. He took and tied to a tree the strap that served him as a girdle, and began to hang and strangle himself in earnest. He soon lost consciousness and would have...lost his life if his own sister had not happened to come by chance...to the very place where her miserable brother was hanging.<br>She cut the strap promptly, and after having lamented as dead this man in which she could not see any sign of life, she came to announce this sad news to the Indians who were with Monsieur Denys. They went into the woods and brought to the habitation this unhappy Gaspesian, who was still breathing, though but little. I forced open his teeth, and, having made him swallow some spoonfuls of brandy, he came to himself...<br>His brother had formerly hung [sic] and strangled himself...in the Bay of Gasp\u00e9, because he was refused by a girl he loved tenderly, and whom he sought in marriage. For, in fact, although our Gaspesians...live joyously and contentedly...some among them fall occasionally into a melancholy so black and so profound that they become immersed wholly in a cruel despair, and even make attempts upon their own lives (Hoffman, 1955, p. 274; Paul, 2006, p. 27). </p>",

Probably not - we can<sq>t even get [most of Europe there](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_<percent>28PPP<percent>29_per_capita), much less Asia, much less Africa.<br><br>But can we get everyone to $10,000 in per capita GDP? Maybe.<br><br>What about $1,000? $700? Almost certainly, within the next 15 or 30 years.<br><br>I<sq>m going to outline three scenarios in the order of more likely to less likely.<br><br>1. I think we can get everyone above $2/day, that is, above $700 in per capita income, and we<sq>ll achieve that within the next half-century. See [Paul Collier](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Collier) and his book *The Bottom Billion.* It<sq>s happening and we are on the cusp of eradicating extreme poverty within our lifetimes.<br><br>  That<sq>s a *major* achievement for humanity.<br><br>  Round up and say that **$1,000** in per-capita GDP per person is doable.  There might be pockets of extreme poverty but the broad goal is feasible. It<sq>s not <dq>developed<dq> but it sure beats crushing poverty.<br><br>  Getting the bottom billion out of crushing poverty is the central aim of global antipoverty efforts, and is the first step. It is almost certainly feasible. (I am repeating myself here because it is a big deal.)<br><br>2. The next big threshold is about **$10,000** in per-capita GDP. That<sq>s where you stop seeing authoritarian governments and start seeing democracies - political development and economic development flow together. (Don<sq>t ask me about which direction causality runs in, because that<sq>s a very hard question. Look at [Acemoglu](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail) and perhaps [de Soto](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Capital).) <br><br>  Can we get the entire world to middle-income status? Maybe. Let me see if I can draw up a map of cellular phone penetration in Africa - because even in dirt-poor Africa, lot of people have cell phones now. That<sq>s a major element of middle-income life. <br><br>  If we let <dq>connectivity<dq> to the world economy -- measured by trade openness, Internet access, and cell phone access -- measure middle-income status, then I argue that we can bring the entire world to middle income. It<sq>s feasible, but might take a bit longer than the previous threshold. <br><br>  Note that China is brushing up against that $10,000 per-capita income threshold.  India is a bit further behind at around $4,000 per-capita income. But getting those two countries - a third of the world<sq>s population! - out of crushing poverty has to be one of the unsung victories of the 20th century. You can thank the [1978 reforms in China](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping) and the [1980 reforms in India](http<colon>//www.cerium.ca/IMG/pdf/IMF.pdf) for that miracle.<br><br>  Note also that **world per capita GDP is around $12,000**, but I<sq>m talking about putting a floor down, that even <dq>poor<dq> countries would pull in $1,000 or $10,000 in per-capita income. <br><br>3. The next big threshold would be getting everyone to **$30,000** in per-capita income. That seems difficult to me for physical reasons - we might run out of cheap energy before we get there. But I<sq>m a pessimist. <br><br>If I were to go on, I<sq>d probably point out energy consumption as the critical limiting factor in the global antipoverty campaign, followed by shipping issues. A more careful analysis would try to figure out if we have the energy resources to sustain an entire planet at developed-country energy-intensity. That calculation probably wouldn<sq>t look pretty. <br><br>----<br><br>What does a fully-developed world (say, $7k+ or $10k+ GDP per capita in poor countries) look like? <br><br>It<sq>s a much older world. Look at the demographic profiles of currently-rich countries against currently-poor ones.  We probably hit 9 billion, maybe 10 billion people in mid-century and stabilize there. 2 billion young, 2 billion old, about 6 billion in the middle. <br><br>There<sq>s probably more international trade, just extrapolating from trends in currently developed countries.  Rich countries are trading countries.<br><br>Owing in part to the prior two points, there<sq>s a lot less war. When was the last time we had nation-on-nation war in Europe, North America, or northeast Asia, the currently rich parts of the globe? Pretty much all of the violence, all of the civil war, all of the genocide, happens in poor parts of the planet. That shouldn<sq>t be too surprising. <br><br>[Here](http<colon>//journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8919494) is one article that *disagrees* with my main assertions here. It finds that cellular coverage in Africa is associated with more violence, not less. It<sq>s one study, but fair disclosure.<br><br>But now I<sq>m venturing into guesswork, so I<sq>ll pause.<br><br>----<br><br>Edit. Oh god this is a sprawling mess.

Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, as Mao succinctly put it, and as countries get richer they tend to spend more on their armed forces, allowing them to seek a greater role in their region and the world, and to pursue their interests more effectively. Assuming that the typical S-curve of growth holds on average, a fully developed world will have seen a large decrease in wealth (and therefore power) differentials. We could see a truly multi-polar world. The UN Security Council would not survive in its current form, for example.<br><br>More guns doesn<sq>t necessarily mean more conflict, however. The richer you are, the more you have to lose. Advanced economies are also more fragile, in a way, being more complex, more trade-dependent, and with far fewer people capable of doing without complicated supply lines. <br><br>On the other hand, the incidence of intra-state conflict might not be affected at all, as the internal inequalities that generate it are not simply economic. Even if they were, they could go in any direction depending on domestic political considerations.<br><br>Assuming no technological breakthroughs that up-end the current mixed-capitalism norm, trade flows will change drastically as national economic structures become more balanced between primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. There will be international variance in productivity and wages of course, but of a far lesser degree. Economic incentives to migrate will decrease, and presumably resistance to migration too, although the usual concerns about differing cultures will remain.<br><br>Assuming no technological breakthroughs in areas like energy and resource extraction, water and soil usage, waste disposal and the like, the environment could be in *very* bad shape. The world will be warmer by 3 or 6 or more degrees Celsius (which could stymie any growth plans for a whole swathe of the developing world). Sea levels will have risen, impacting areas where huge numbers live. Water tables will have dropped, aquifers depleted, rivers polluted, forests cut down, and a vast array of species extinct. Pressures on agricultural production will make inefficient uses of natural resources, like raising cattle for meat, a lot more expensive (perhaps prohibitively so). Wild fish stocks will virtually disappear, with aquaculture kicking into high gear and becoming the main source of animal protein. Above a certain income threshold, [people<sq>s priorities change](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve#Environmental_Kuznets_curve).

In 1991, when Judith Polg\u00e1r was 15 years and 4 months old, she became the youngest grandmaster in history. She was at one point ranked #8 in the world and defeated Anand, Carlsen, Kasparov, and other world champions. Also, as /u/CyruscM showed, it<sq>s a matter of proportions. Few women play chess. But then there<sq>s a separate question<colon> why are there fewer female chess players?<br><br>I believe biology can account for the fact that men seem to be more interested in chess than women. Simon Baron-Cohen is known for his [<dq>extreme male brain theory of autism<dq>](http<colon>//cogsci.bme.hu/~ivady/bscs/read/bc.pdf). A part of this theory is that people differ on a emphatising/systemising-spectrum, with women on average leaning toward the former and men toward the latter. It<sq>s all about interest. People closer to the empathising part of the spectrum are interested in social information. They want to know what others are thinking and feeling. They want to be able to predict how people will behave. People closer to the systemising part are interested in information about systems. How variables interact in a closed system. They want to be able to predict how systems work. [I think this video does a good job at (humorously) illustrating this difference between men and women](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg)<colon> men are more inclined toward seeing themselves and other people as systems that should be <sq>fixed<sq>, while women are more inclined toward seeing themselves and other people as persons who should be understood.<br><br>So chess is more attractive to men because it is a closed system with predictable rules. It is less attractive to women because it is not a very social game.<br><br>Another facet might be the different responses to stress in men and women. [Men tend to either fight or escape when faced with stress, while women seek social support](http<colon>//www.updegrafflab.org/files/5713/3886/8266/TKLGGU-00.pdf). When you<sq>re playing a stressful game without any teammates, there aren<sq>t many opportunities for social support.<br><br>Based on this I think that there is no difference in inborne talent. I think the difference is that men are more likely to be motivated to play chess than women, based mostly on biological factors.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>In order to deal with such cultural phenomenon we must research cultural dynamics and cultural exchange instead of something as presumptive as the supposedly idiosyncratic practice of seeking other cultures to belong. The work on symbolic anthropology by professor Clifford Geertz might help to fully grasp it, of which I recommend the book The Interpretation of Cultures.<br><br>To begin with, when people identify with other cultures, there is a relation among both cultures actually. People that put great value on their own cultural background tend to minimize such relation because that<sq>s how such a thing as <dq>own cultural background<dq> emerges<colon> being different from others. But why would Californians recognize the Ancient Greeks in their heritage while not recognizing the Japanese impact in their culture? First, Japan is closest to California than Ancient Greece, weather we measure in travel distance among actual locations or in time-spam; second, there are probably many Japanese people that know about American culture and even identify with it while there are absolutely no Ancient Greek that had contact with American culture so we could see anything genuinely American there.<br><br>However, the notion of genuine culture is but another effort to differentiate one<sq>s culture from others in cultural development, while in reality forcefully differentiated cultures may just get even more interconnected by constant mutual acknowledgement and denial of the other. National culture in general, such as American or Japanese, is an example of genuine culture as a fabrication of Nationalism. Nationalist movements had success in uniting very different people in a single national culture in part by showing how these cultures are related while in the other hand creating oppositions to cultures which are actually similar but outside the national borders. Moreover, new cultures may just naturally emerge from the mixing of many different cultures, even without direct contact.<br><br>Maybe there<sq>s something about a specific remote culture that<sq>s just appealing. Could Americans be just trying to find their Irish selves in the Celts? There could be some particular aspect one could identify with, or perhaps another culture<sq>s charm is in the difference itself. Regarding the example of Japanese subculture in America, it seems that the identical subculture in Tokyo for instance is seen as Western subculture by Japanese traditionalists! See article by [Masafumi Monden](http<colon>//www.academia.edu/4825302/The_Nationality_of_Lolita_Fashion).

Data, such as the big analysis John Rothwell did at Gallup ([the Washington Post<sq>s write up](https<colon>//www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/12/a-massive-new-study-debunks-a-widespread-theory-for-donald-trumps-success/), [Rothwell<sq>s write up](http<colon>//www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/193898/economic-hardship-favorable-views-trump.aspx), [actual working paper](http<colon>//papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2822059)), suggest that Trump voters tend to be if anything more secure than the country as a whole. One thing to note is that Rothwell is looking primarily at data collected in the primaries. But Rothwell wasn<sq>t alone in that conclusion\u2014FiveThirtyEight also was publishing articles as the primaries were still going on with titles like <dq>[The Mythology Of Trump\u2019s \u2018Working Class\u2019 Support](http<colon>//fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/)<dq>. <br><br>However, much of the qualitative reporting I<sq>ve read suggests that worries by older people about their *children<sq>s* and *grandchildren<sq>s* future was at play in a lot of decisions to vote for Trump. I particularly remember this coming out of FiveThirtyEight; here<sq>s a story Farai Chideya called <dq>[Trump\u2019s Blue Collar Base Wants More Jobs And An America Like The Past](http<colon>//fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-base-is-blue-collar-his-voters-looking-for-a-return-to-better-times/)<dq> that gets at this. Claire Malone at FiveThirtyEight also emphasized this point repeatedly, both in her writing and in their podcast<colon> it<sq>s often worries about the *next* generation that seems to animate Trump voter<sq>s economic anxiety, as well as worries about the well-beings of their communities in general. I remember in particular Malone reporting on how people were worried that the next generation was going to have to move away. Here it<sq>s important to keep in mind that more than half the electorate is over 45, and where Trump most overperformed both polling and previous Republicans going back to the 1980<sq>s was in the Rust Belt. It<sq>s interesting in the Chideya piece I linked to that the people who expressed these worries most concretely had sent their children or grandchildren to college, but were worried about others in the community. Economists have argued that while economic returns on college degrees have increased little, particularly over the decade since the economic crisis, they<sq>re getting to be a better investment in part because wages for those without a college degree have been steadily falling over the same period. Here<sq>s a fairly representative paper from [Abel and Deitz](https<colon>//www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci20-3.pdf).  Here<sq>s how their conclusion begins<colon><br><br>>With tuition rising, wages falling, and many college graduates struggling to find good jobs, the value of a college degree may seem to be in doubt. However, these factors alone do not determine whether a college education is a good investment. Indeed, once the full set of costs and benefits is taken into account, investing in a college education still appears to be a wise economic decision for the average person.<br><br>>**Why is this the case? The answer lies in the declining fortunes of those without a college degree**\u2014a key consideration in assessing the economic costs and benefits of obtaining a college degree. On the benefit side, although the wages of college- educated workers have stagnated since the early 2000s\u2014and even declined in the years since the Great Recession\u2014the wages of high school graduates have also been falling. As a result, the college wage premium has remained near its all-time high. On the cost side, rising college tuition has largely been off set by the declining opportunity cost of attending school, which, again, is driven by the falling wages of high school graduates.<br><br>Much has been made about how the most noteable difference between Romney vs Obama and Trump vs. Clinton is that Trump won a larger share of whites without a college degree and Clinton won a larger share of whites with a college degree. I<sq>m not sure exactly how the final voting turned out, but it was long talked about how Trump might be the [first Republican in 60 years to lose college educated whites](http<colon>//fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-may-become-the-first-republican-in-60-years-to-lose-white-college-graduates/)\u2014and how it might [might not matter if Trump does sufficiently well with (White) voters without a college degree](http<colon>//projects.fivethirtyeight.com/clinton-trump-vote-maps-2016/). <br><br>Exit polls suggest that Trump gained in the bottom two economic categories (that is, everyone below $50,000) and those with less than a college education ([see here](http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=0)) but a some of that could simply be due to lower black turnout. Most of these discussion focus on white voters, and I haven<sq>t seen the post-election data on just them by income. By education, however, it<sq>s clear<colon> Clinton did ten points better than Obama in 2012 with whites with a college degree (still losing the category, but narrowly), and Trump did *fourteen* points better than Romney with whites without a college degree. <br><br>But the main thrust of what I<sq>m saying is this<colon> I don<sq>t think anyone is making an argument that Trump voters are primarily responding to *accute* economic distress, but rather there is a good case to be made that some appear to be responding more *chronic* socio-economic distress. Unfortunately, many of the traditional direct measures of economic optimism or pessimism (such as questions about whether the country is on the right track or the wrong track) seem to be so penetrated by partistanism as to be useless as a measure of economic outlook (that is, Republicans tend to say that the economy is doing poorly under a Democrat and vice versa in a much more pronounced way than in the past). As the above [link to the exit polls show](http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=0), Clinton actually won voters who say <dq>the economy<dq> is their biggest issue 52<percent>-42<percent>... and Trump won people who say their economic situation is worse today than four years ago 78<percent>-19<percent>. I<sq>m not sure that people have found a way to measure this longer term economic pessimism with a survey instrument that wasn<sq>t deeply affected by partisan polarization, though there may well be good survey questions out there on this subject. <br><br>The exit polls, at the very least, have Clinton winning the roughly third of voters who say the next generation will have a life <dq>better than today<dq> 59<percent> to 38<percent>, winning the quarter who say <dq>about the same<dq> 54<percent> to 39<percent>, but losing the third of voters who say that life for the next generation will be <dq>worse than today<dq> 31<percent> to 63<percent>. Certainly some of that is driven by partisanship (that is, if you look at data going back to other years, which the above link lets you do, Democrats consistently think the economy is better under a Democratic president and Republicans consistently think the economy is better under a Republicam president), but the qualitative reporting on this election seems to suggest that these long term economic concerns (particularly for their specific communities and for the younger generations of their families) were a genuine issue that commonly came up in interviews. When Trump voters talk about economic distress, it<sq>s more likely be a long term sort of economic distress\u2014<dq>What kind of opportunities will my children and grandchildren have?<dq>, <dq>What will kids without a college degree do around here because all the jobs are going away?<dq>\u2014rather than a more immediate <dq>How will I pay my bills this month<dq> sort of economic distress. </p>",

While it<sq>s less researched now, it<sq>s more because no one has anything new to say about it than it has been supplanted.  Basically, though not socially or culturally dominant, certain groups or categories of people become dominant in a market sector (or multiple market niches, in most cases).  These are not just Jews, but Arabs across the Indian Ocean, Indians in East Africa, Chinese in parts of Southeast Asia, etc. etc.  The most famous article on the subject, <dq>[<dq>A Theory of Middleman Minorities<dq>](http<colon>//www.neiu.edu/~circill/benjamin/psci411b/theory.pdf), was published in ASR in 1973.  These theories emphasize both the mobility and solidarity of the groups (that is, say, a Chetti in Southeast Asia can travel around and find other Chetti<sq>s in other places who will help them).  This mobility (allowing access to new products, markets, and supply chains; mobility also being mobility of goods as well as individuals) and solidarity (which in more contemporary terms you could think of <dq>weak ties<dq> and <dq>social capital<dq>) enables the groups to thrive.<br><br>In the case of the Jews in the U.S. specifically, I<sq>ll highlight two other structural things, the first specific to the Jews, the second more general. 1) there was an established group (mainly originally German-speaking Western European Jews, though also Sephardi Jews) who helped the poor incoming group (mainly Yiddish, Polish, and Russian speaking Eastern Europe Jews) through benevolent societies, etc.  There were lots of [free loan societies](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Free_Loan_Society_of_New_York), Jewish hospitals, Jewish schools, etc., but it helps that when the waves of poor immigrants arrived, there were already some relatively established groups (Supreme Court Justice [Benjamin Cardozo](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_N._Cardozo)<sq>s family had been in America since colonial times, for instance, and FDR<sq>s Treasury Secretary [Henry Morgenthau](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgenthau,_Jr.)<sq>s father came to America from Germany in relatively comfortable circumstances) who were interested in helping the new immigrants through institutions that they set up and controlled.  Comparable groups, like Italians, Poles, and the Irish, to my knowledge, did not benefit from either an earlier set of more prosperous immigrants, or have the same ability to create institutions that were targeted as specifically towards the group (the fact that Jews were a separate religion *and( a separate ethnicity and that Yiddish formed some sort of lingua franca among the immigrants all likely set Jews apart from their contemporaries).<br><br>2) The New Deal helped whites, including white immigrants, a lot.  Cybelle Fox<sq>s *Three Worlds of Relief<colon><br>Race, Immigration, and the American Welfare State from the Progressive Era to the New Deal* (which last year won sociology<sq>s most prestigious book prize) found that white immigrants generally were heavily helped by the new deal, unlike their black and Hispanic counterparts.  Copy pasted from the blurb<colon><br><br>>Fox finds that, despite rampant nativism, European immigrants received generous access to social welfare programs. The communities in which they lived invested heavily in relief. Social workers protected them from snooping immigration agents, and ensured that noncitizenship and illegal status did not prevent them from receiving the assistance they needed. But that same helping hand was not extended to Mexicans and blacks. Fox reveals, for example, how blacks were relegated to racist and degrading public assistance programs, while Mexicans who asked for assistance were deported with the help of the very social workers they turned to for aid. <br><br>>Drawing on a wealth of archival evidence, Fox paints a riveting portrait of how race, labor, and politics combined to create three starkly different worlds of relief. She debunks the myth that white America<sq>s immigrant ancestors pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, unlike immigrants and minorities today.<br><br>Finally, yes, as many of the deleted comments mention, there are cultural factors at play here, too, where Protestants, Catholics, and Jews have had somewhat different preferences (though other research has shown these preferences are not fixed).  I don<sq>t remember all the details, but the first big, statistical study on this was [Lenski](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Lenski)<sq>s *The Religious Factor* (1961), which was based a large N-survey of Detroit.  I can<sq>t remember all the details of the book, but I am fairly sure Jews did place a particularly high value on education (I can<sq>t remember what Lenski found about other, more economic preferences and career paths, sadly).   edit<colon> I think /u/the_liebstod presents [a compelling theory](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/1xwdpp/how_did_the_jewish_community_in_america_go_from/cffaj3t) about *why* Jews might have had a preference for investing in education.<br><br>It<sq>s worth noting, though, that white immigrant groups in general have done well in America (the Supreme Court, for instance, has no WASPs on it today, only Jews and Catholics). There<sq>s also an aspect of economic geography here, though I know little about it, where Jews tended to settle in places that later became economic power houses.  While many immigrant groups came to America interested in farming (look at the Finns or the Swedes who settled in the rural Upper Midwest), Jews tended to settled in cities, particularly successful cities at that.  While there are certainly some cultural factors at play here, it<sq>s important to recognize that there were also multiple structural factories (inside and outside the Jewish community) at play here as well.<br><br>(gut shabbos everyone)</p>",

It<sq>s extremely rare that offenders are mistreated by staff. In history I would say staff were <dq>rougher<dq> but still nowhere near as concerning as other offenders. There *were* even parts of our prisons that staff was actually not allowed. Sections were entirely run by prison gangs and offenders. It was extremely dangerous 50+ years ago due to the uncontrolled nature of the prison population. Your post implies that staff used to be more dangerous than other offenders, and I<sq>m just saying that I think that is incredibly untrue, at least in my state.<br><br>We now have more control and better policies ourselves which makes it a safer place with reduced threat from offenders and staff. Rape is also *extremely* over-hyped in popular culture. I would say rapes are actually quite uncommon. I<sq>m sure they<sq>re under reported, but even at the rate they are reported it<sq>s only a handful of incidents each year for the entire state. Something like 99<percent> of reported cases are unfounded, most are actually against staff. PREA (Prison Rape Elimination Act) governs a lot of this and PREA reports are usually against staff. Whether against staff or another offender, I<sq>ve seen (and the internal statistics I have reviewed support this) that almost all cases are reported falsely in order to try and get the falsely accused offender or staff moved or the person reporting moved to anther location or facility in order to avoid problems (gambling debts, bullying, etc.).<br><br>Going back to your initial question about whether or not prisons are more violent now than in the past, I would say completely the opposite is true. Prisons are safer now than any time in history, again at least in my state. In a facility I worked at recently I looked at the past 12 months and violent incidents (between offenders) was less than 10 incidents per month in a population of about 1,900 and staff incidents were very minimal (all cases of offenders attacking staff).<br><br>Some things that have changed over time are increased rights. I don<sq>t know all the laws off the top of my head, but things like enforcement of the 8th amendment in court cases where offenders have sued the state and won have been big catalysts. We<sq>ve learned that violence drastically increases when basic needs are diminished so we<sq>ve improved food, medicine, and essential living conditions. We<sq>ve increased programming (education, work opportunities, religious activities, events, family visits, etc.).<br><br>Racial segregation is not a new thing, this goes back to racism in world history. It<sq>s still very much alive in prison, but I can tell you I<sq>ve been in some hardcore living units and watched blacks and whites play chess together which is not something you would have seen at many points in history.<br><br>I am just going to stop typing but if you have any questions about pretty much anything I can probably answer, let me know.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Yes.<br><br>Football teams, for the most part, are what you<sq>re thinking of.<br><br>Most of the time, football teams in Europe began <sq>organically<sq>. For example, England<sq>s league system is currently a <sq>pyramid<sq> - [Burgess Hill Albion Football Club](http<colon>//www.bhafc.com/BHAFC<percent>20Player<percent>20Profile<percent>201st<percent>20Team.htm) are technically in the same set up as Manchester United, just *24* tiers lower. If the were good enough, they could make that 23. If there was a miracle, they could be in the Premier League within the lifetime of a fan. Similar things have happened where teams like [Castel di Sangro](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S.D._Castel_di_Sangro_Calcio) - whose stadium at 8000 is larger than their population of 6000 - have made their way to Serie B, the second highest level in Italy. In comparison to most US team sports, where teams move from city to city, ~~all~~ the players and franchises are owned by a central body\\*, and rules exist to (ironically) stop real open-market competition, European football allows for far more involvement in the local community and with the fans. For instance, my wife and I own part of our local football club and my wife has been elected to the board of management. We are friendly with the players. We<sq>re not a very big club but *it<sq>s ours*, and the good days are all the better for it when you<sq>ve had 99 bad days.<br><br>What has this to do with fans? Well, it has always been like this, for more than a hundred years. The biggest controversy in modern football is the fear of <dq>franchising<dq>. There are clubs that are nearly 150 years old; they began often as groups of friends, groups of hobbyists, and so on. Leagues were created for the sake of playing football, not for Sports Entertainment ^^TM. The organic nature of things means that the fans have a commitment to the team, just as the team have a commitment to the fans. Many clubs are in fact owned and run by fan organisations; in Italy, it would often been a local co-operative that elects leaders. Even the biggest clubs - at least until very, very recently - would have had some deep connection with their local area.<br><br>If the (most deeply committed) fans are all from one area, it is likely that they are often part of one race, economic status or religion. This is sometimes very very opaque - Glasgow Celtic and their fans, for example, do absolutely everything in their power to play up their links to local Irish immigrants (ironically, to the detriment of actual Irish football teams). When it is this opaque, it becomes an issue when they face a team with obviously very different <sq>values<sq>.<br><br>Most often, the biggest rivalries will be within a city; for example, Glasgow Celtic<sq>s main rivals are Glasgow Rangers, who (almost just because Celtic put the Irish flag in everyone<sq>s faces) put the Union flag everywhere. The clubs would have operated on strict rules in the past - Celtic being the last club to win the European Cup (today called the humorously inaccurate <sq>Champions League<sq> which is neither a league nor exclusive to champions) with a group of men all born within 50 miles of the stadium, and all Catholic. The first player to move between the two clubs was in the 1980s I believe, after more than a 100 years of sharing a city.<br><br>Around Europe and South America, clubs began to represent something more than just the football or the immediate local area. Lazio, for example, are a <dq>right wing club<dq>; while St. Pauli are a <dq>socialist club<dq>. Again within cities, Lazio are <dq>middle class<dq>, Roma are <dq>working class<dq>. In Buenos Aires, Boca Junior (the club of Maradona) represent the more working class people; River Plate (Alfredo di Stefano) represent the upper class; similarly, in Istanbul, Galatasaray are considered a middle class team while Fenerbahce are working class team. Some rivalries were created by actual divisions within a single original club - Internazionale of Milan were created when a deep fracture occurred in Milan<sq>s football club regarding whether or not international players should be signed; Fluminense of Rio de Janeiro hate Flamengo because it was a nothing club until half their players mutinied and join their local rivals.<br><br>Outside of cities, rivalries can occur because of nationalism; Real Madrid (literally, the Madrid <sq>Royals<sq>) represent the dominance of the kingdom of Castille within Spain, while Barcelona have always been the unofficial <sq>national team<sq> of the separatist Catalan region. Derry City FC represented the largest <sq>Republican/Catholic<sq> city in Northern Ireland, and had so much trouble with the rest of their mostly Protestant/Unionist league (particularly Linfield FC, who act like a midget version of Glasgow Rangers) that they were removed and now play in the Republic<sq>s league.<br><br>These were the origins of deep animosity between clubs and their fans. These are the baselines where there would always have been issues. However, in the 70s and 80s, a culture grew up of <sq>firms<sq>. Even clubs that were previously apolitical found themselves at the centre of violence as people used them as a rallying point for groups which had very little to do with the actual football. Like gangs in the USA it was often less about who you supported than who you wanted to be friends with. They would avoid fighting <sq>normal<sq> fans unless provoked; it got to the point where the fights were arranged away from the stadium so there would be less police around.

The Sunnis in other nations are, I would assume, more tolerant of Shiites, given how extreme the Wahhabist sect is. <br><br>The important thing to keep in mind is that the Hajj is a huge economic driver for Mecca and Saudi Arabia. Something like three million visitors come every year for their Hajj--that<sq>s a huge source of revenue for the city and the Saudi government. As extreme as their religious beliefs might be, the Saudis are also quite the capitalists (one need not look further than their extensive oil wealth to prove that point).

One key pillar of Islam, that I believe makes it a particularly unique faith, is its concept of brotherhood or the *ummah*. Regardless of which sect they are in, Muslims generally feel a great sense of brotherhood with their fellow Muslims. Whenever Muslims are persecuted or killed, you will always see Muslims from around the world coming to their aid (during the Bosnian civil war, both the American and Soviet wars in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and the various Arab spring conflicts, etc., Muslims left their home countries in droves to go fight what they believed to be a common enemy against Islam). <br><br>In one of the Islam classes I took in college, I remember asking the professor if the concept of the ummah essentially meant that at the end of the day, a Sunni is going to view a Shiite as his ally more than any other non-Muslim.

So, apparently in 1971, even before the Iranian Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told his followers to spread his political message while on Hajj.  This lead to annual protests (they<sq>re usually called protests, but think of them more like rallies) in favor of the Ayatollah and against usually Israel and USA (who else?).  After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, these became much more noticeable, and in 1981, the Shi<sq>a Islamists were even chanting slogans within the Masjid al-Haram (where the Ka<sq>aba is). Security was also increased in general after the 1979 take over of the Masjid al-Haram by a millenialist group. During the Iraq-Iran war, there were increased tensions but both sides tried to reign in their extremists; the Iranians were allowed to hold their rallies (*not* in the Masjid al-Haram) but agreed not to distribute printed material.  In 1987, this protest/rally/march was halted by Saudi security near the end of its normal route and the incident escalated into violence where hundreds were dead and wounded.  The details of what exactly happened, who <dq>started it<dq>, are hotly contested.  I think it ended with no Iranians joining Hajj in 1988-1990.  Iranian pilgrims post-1991 still have some pro-Ayatollah protests with limited incidents.  <br><br>The Wikipedia also lists several earlier (pre-Iranian Revolution) incidents involving Shi<sq>a, but they seem more isolated.

I<sq>m no expert on Hajj ritual, but I don<sq>t know of anything in particular that would mark Sunni/Shi<sq>a/Ahmadi while on Hajj (other than, to a degree, the Persian language) as ritual action and ritual dress are clearly prescribed and, to my knowledge, universal.</p>",

Over the last 30 years their think tanks have made a heavy investment in ideas and in language. In 1970, [Supreme Court Justice] Lewis Powell wrote a fateful memo to the National Chamber of Commerce saying that all of our best students are becoming anti-business because of the Vietnam War, and that we needed to do something about it. Powell<sq>s agenda included getting wealthy conservatives to set up professorships, setting up institutes on and off campus where intellectuals would write books from a conservative business perspective, and setting up think tanks. He outlined the whole thing in 1970. They set up the Heritage Foundation in 1973, and the Manhattan Institute after that. [There are many others, including the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institute at Stanford, which date from the 1940s.]<br><br>And now, as the New York Times Magazine quoted Paul Weyrich, who started the Heritage Foundation, they have 1,500 conservative radio talk show hosts. They have a huge, very good operation, and they understand their own moral system. They understand what unites conservatives, and they understand how to talk about it, and they are constantly updating their research on how best to express their ideas.<br><br>Why haven<sq>t progressives done the same thing?<br><br>There<sq>s a systematic reason for that. You can see it in the way that conservative foundations and progressive foundations work. Conservative foundations give large block grants year after year to their think tanks. They say, <sq>Here<sq>s several million dollars, do what you need to do.<sq> And basically, they build infrastructure, they build TV studios, hire intellectuals, set aside money to buy a lot of books to get them on the best-seller lists, hire research assistants for their intellectuals so they do well on TV, and hire agents to put them on TV. They do all of that. Why? Because the conservative moral system, which I analyzed in <dq>Moral Politics,<dq> has as its highest value preserving and defending the <dq>strict father<dq> system itself. And that means building infrastructure. As businessmen, they know how to do this very well.<br><br>Meanwhile, liberals<sq> conceptual system of the <dq>nurturant parent<dq> has as its highest value helping individuals who need help.

Make sure it all goes to the cause, don<sq>t use it for administration, communication, infrastructure, or career development.<sq> So there<sq>s actually a structural reason built into the worldviews that explains why conservatives have done better.<br><br></p>",

This young man had captured five different women at gunpoint and raped them, after which he stabbed them to death. It is difficult to imagine how anyone could regard such acts as anything but brutal, cruel, and evil. Yet the man described them in quite different terms. He said he had always made sure to be <dq>kind and gentle<dq> with them, at least <dq>until I started to kill them.<dq> He claimed they enjoyed having sex with him (which is almost certainly false, because surveys of rape victims have found that approximately zero percent of them report any enjoyment or pleasure).

We all want to think of ourselves as moral and rational. When facts contradict this self-image, we do strange things mentally, often by re-evaluating the facts, or finding a different interpretation.

Oftentimes the job of a songwriter is to match the lyrics to melody in order to preserve meaning; when a songwriter doesn<sq>t do this, meaning can be obscured. In this case, Taylor Swift set the lyrics with the wrong syllables emphasized, and with equal length given to syllables that would be of differing length. <br><br>Let<sq>s parse it. <br><br><dq>Got a long list of ex-lovers.<dq> <br><br>If you wanted to plot out the natural stress pattern of this phrase, it<sq>s<colon> <br><br>--//-//-<br><br>So, <dq>got a LONG LIST of EX-LOvers.<dq> If you really wanted to emphasize things, you<sq>d say <dq>got a LONG LIST of EX-LOVers.<dq> <br><br>Also, you<sq>d make certain words longer than others. <dq>got a<dq> would be short, <dq>long<dq> and <dq>list<dq> would be long, <dq>of<dq> would be short, <dq>ex<dq> would be long.

(<dq>long-list-of-ex-lo-vers<dq>.) When you have straight quarter notes, all notes are equal, but some notes are more equal than others. In this case, the music is in 4/4, so the strongest stress happens on the first beat of each count of four - in this case, right on the word <dq>of<dq>. Leading to the highly unnatural <dq>long list OF ex-looooovers<dq>. <br><br>The misemphasis warps the sentence beyond its usual context.

Unstressed vowels (in this case, what<sq>s called a <dq>[schwa](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa),<dq> which means the <dq>uh<dq> sound) are rarely held out, and when they are, they are usually modified by competent singers to from an <dq>uh<dq> sound to an <dq>ah<dq> or <dq>ih<dq>, depending on context. This is why Christmas songs rarely have the word pronounced as <dq>kris-muhs,<dq> as we say it, but rather <dq>kris-miss<dq> or <dq>kris-maaaahs<dq>. Held schwa sounds are weird and awkward for singers. Also when singing, different syllables may get mushed together in order to create a natural, legato phrase, consonants may be de-emphasized or lightened depending on the style, and vowels will be modified slightly in one direction or another.

A bubble is a term with a [specific meaning](http<colon>//www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000278) - <dq>Bubbles refer to asset prices that exceed an asset<sq>s fundamental value because current owners believe they can resell the asset at an even higher price. <dq>. There is no mechanism for which this can work in the education market.<br>> 2. The last 30 years have been characterized by a huge increase in the college wage premium. In 1979, a college educated worker made 35<percent> more than an HS graduate on average, by 1999, they would be making 80<percent> more. [The Race Between Education and Technology](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Race-between-Education-Technology/dp/0674028678) is a great overview of this. A college education is still a really good investment. This isn<sq>t because of selection effects - see [The Causau Effect of Education on Earnings](http<colon>//www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/Classic_Media/Card_1999_Education.pdf).<br>> 3. Virtually no one pays market price for a college education. The financial aid process allows universities to practice almost-perfect [price discrimination](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination). They can effectively charge a different price for every student, so that the market just follows the demand curve up until their maximum tuition level.<br>> 4. The is definitely is a sheepskin effect - http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)#A_basic_job-market_signalling_model - for college diplomas. But this is extremely well understood (Spence shared the economics Nobel with Akerlof for signalling theory). I think that separating bright, talented and hard working 18 year olds from bright, talented and lazy 18 year olds is a non-trivial process. <br>> 5. Tons of articles imply that you don<sq>t need higher education, because you can take classes online. If this was the case, why did the university lecture have survived the invention of the printing press? Books reduced the cost to the diffusion of knowledge far more than the internet did, without ending the university system. This implies that there is something else going on to me.</p>",

Even places that have escaped the worst effects, such as London, have been hit. In cities such as Cleveland, Ohio, where unemployment peaked at 12.5<percent> in 2010, prices have plummeted. Migration is another reason prices have fallen. In big rich cities such as London, which attract an ongoing inward flow of (poorer) migrants, they can push prices down. In places such as Norway, where previously local prostitutes tried to all charge about the same, growing numbers of migrant sex workers make such unofficial price controls harder to sustain. The increase in people selling sex online\u2014where it is easier to be anonymous\u2014has probably boosted local supply. Meanwhile broader social changes may have reduced demand. Casual and adulterous sex is easier to find than in the past. Pre-marital sex is more acceptable and divorce easier, meaning fewer frustrated single and married men turn to prostitutes.<br></p>",

I don<sq>t have an easy all-in-one answer, but rather a few suspicions that are worth thinking about. <br><br>One interesting thing to note is that paranoia and conspiracy thinking is not new. Richard Hofstaadter<sq>s [<dq>The Paranoid Style in American Politics<dq>](http<colon>//harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/) outlines the history of conspiratorial thinking that dates back almost to the nation<sq>s founding.<br><br>You might also think about the massive structural changes that seem to provoke conspiracy movements. The end of slavery, the civil rights movement, the restructuring of the American economy, and so forth, have all spawned numerous conspiracy movements. The KKK, for example, is as much a conspiratorial vision of the world as it is a <dq>white power<dq> movement. Each of these changes posed a threat to taken-for-granted ideas of the <dq>proper<dq> order (the assumed dominance of white middle class males) and hence were frightening. <br><br>What Hofstadter does not mention is that this is almost entirely (in the U.S.) a white phenomenon. Several of the essays in [<dq>Histories of the Future,<dq>](https<colon>//www.dukeupress.edu/histories-of-the-future) for example, examine how the economic changes of the 1980s and 1990s (the same that began the rapid decline of the middle class and the rapid concentration of wealth in the hands of a few economic elites) provoked feelings of global conspiracies among formerly working-class whites. Looking further back, you can see how the objects of fear evoked in conspiracy theories tend to victimize white men or threaten white women (hence necessitating a response from white men).<br><br>Another compelling idea comes from basic politics<colon> it is easy to make people afraid and fearful people are very suggestible. A modestly compelling speaker can gain followers by speaking to their fears; a seasoned political actor can make a career out of it. Adam Curtis<sq> [<dq>The Power of Nightmares<dq>](http<colon>//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/4202741.stm) (not a peer reviewed source but a popular documentary) examines how playing to peoples fears has been a central part of politics for decades, and a crucial part of the neo-conservative movement.<br><br>If you take a global perspective, you see how structural changes, particularly economic ones, tend to provoke conspiratorial thinking. Again, it is worth saying that it is usually disenfranchised members the hegemonic group that are the main supporters of these movements. Douglas Holmes<sq> <dq>Integral Europe<dq> is a fair study of current European movements that are roughly equivalent to modern militia movements. <br><br>All of this is to say that I suspect that conspiratorial thinking has something to do with the fragility of hegemonic classes and the ease with which that fragility can be molded into irrational fear.  </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Privilege is a much broader concept than just <dq>male privilege<dq>.  <dq>White privilege<dq> is also common trope.  For example, Peggy McIntosh<sq>s [Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack](http<colon>//www.amptoons.com/blog/files/mcintosh.html) is a very common pedagogical tool (though it<sq>s certainly not cutting edge research).  Most sociologists would probably frame what other people call <dq>male/white/whatever privilege<dq> in terms of societal structure rather than individual <dq>privilege<dq>, but the similar arguments are often there.  The winner of our big book award this year, the C. Wright Mills award, [Cybelle Fox<sq>s *Three Worlds of Relief<colon> Race, Immigration, and the American Welfare State from the Progressive Era to the New Deal*](http<colon>//press.princeton.edu/titles/9754.html), a outstandingly empirical work of historical sociology which details how black and hispanic people were systematically disadvantaged by early 20th century social policy (for example, social workers helping to deport Hispanic immigrants and not helping to get black citizens all the benefits to which they were entitled) while the early American welfare state systematically did aid recent European immigrants, you know, the ones who <dq>pulled themselves up by their boot straps<dq>.  I sort of doubt the author uses the term <dq>white privilege<dq> explicitly, and it<sq>s probably not a word I<sq>d use to describe it, but I certainly wouldn<sq>t argue with someone calling it that.  You can read the first chapter, which I *think* lays out out the main argument of the book, [here](http<colon>//press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9754.pdf).<br><br>Privilege is still a concern in sociology, though.  In fact, the book that won the C. Wright Mills Award last year (2011) is simply called [*Privilege* by Shamus Khan](http<colon>//press.princeton.edu/titles/9294.html).  It<sq>s not really about racial or gender privilege, but <dq>privilege<dq> in a more conventional sense<colon> socio-economic privilege (with a heavy emphasis on the socio-, obviously).  It is cutting edge research in the sense that it emphasizes how socio-economic privilege has changed in America over the last twenty years, and now is much meritocratic, in rhetoric and presentation if not necessarily in reality.  I really recommend it--unlike most path-breaking sociology books, it<sq>s actually enjoyably written.  The introductory chapter, <dq>Democratic Inequality<dq> [is also available for free online](http<colon>//press.princeton.edu/chapters/i9294.pdf) (I love Princeton University Press).  It basically lays out the whole thrust of the book and, honestly, probably one of the best examples of how <dq>privilege<dq> is used today.<br><br>But I<sq>ll agree with /u/banjaloupe that, at least in sociology, the work on sociology of gender is very much connected to and in conversation with the gender studies literature.  That said, I think there<sq>s relatively little empirical work on <dq>the rape culture<dq> recently, and what there is, isn<sq>t considered pathbreaking.  Searching [<dq>rape culture<dq> in Google Scholar and limiting my search to things since 2009](http<colon>//scholar.google.com/scholar?start=10&q=<percent>22rape+culture<percent>22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33&as_ylo=2009), I see a couple of articles, sure, but noticeably very few of the articles have been cited.

Once you take out the book reviews (that is, anything that says like <dq>Oxford University Press, 2011. Pp. viii+ 230. $99.00 (cloth).<dq>), you<sq>ll see that most of the articles have citations.

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m sorry but there<sq>s just to easy way to answer this briefly. Population health is what I study, and I can say that Denmark<sq>s health status is one of the most difficult questions to get a good answer to, from any expert on the topic. For those who can give a convincing answer, if you then apply that logic to other nations, you will find their answer falls apart. For the answers that neatly explain the health status of other nations, Denmark is an odd sort of exception (that is, egalitarianism and low levels of inequality, as well as average income and educational status, social expenditures, and so on all are normally very strongly associated with the health status of a society ... in Denmark, at the surface level, these associations don<sq>t *appear* to hold as well ... more on this in a sec). I will give a very brief answer; in the population health course for which I used to be a teaching assistant we dedicated multiple days to looking at Denmark<sq>s health status (after spending several weeks laying the groundwork for understanding population health), so there is just no way a random reddit comment, no matter how well cited, is going to explain this (and as I mentioned before, I am not fully satisfied by ANY of the answers I<sq>ve come across for Denmark ... they get me about 70<percent> of the way there, at best).<br><br>Disclaimer<colon> lots of citations below, but no time to turn them into links, and I am pulling them all from memory so some spelling or minor details might be wrong.<br><br>Oddly enough, medical care is not that strongly associated with population health status. There have been some studies (eg Bunker) that show medical advancements have some population level attributions for increase in life expectancy, but also many studies showing medical care is a leading cause of death (eg Starfield, IOM <dq>to err is human<dq>) in the USA. Several textbooks that deal with public health and population health say something to the effect of <dq>despite many efforts, no one has convincingly shown the role of medical care in improving health of populations<dq> (I am in this case paraphrashing a 2003 edition of Oxford textbook of Public Health). Institute of medicine<sq>s report <dq>shorter lives, poorer health<dq> states, <dq>Americans with healthy behaviors or those who are white, insured, college-educated, or in upper-income groups appear to be in worse health than similar groups in comparison countries<dq> ... so you can see that even our insured populations do poorly in America. There is something else about being in America, beyond medical care (because we can look at subgroups who have ready access) that is bad for health status. You can<sq>t randomize (for ethical reasons) trials of medical care vs no medical care, so it<sq>s hard to study. The few natural experiments of doctors and nurses strikes that have been studied do not show anything that is useful for those who want to demonstrate the importance of medicine to population health. Lots of interesting studies on narrow aspects of medical care and health ... for example, that African Americans are less likely to get cutting edge care when having a heart attack, but were actually less likely to die as a result because the cutting edge care in this case (a decade ago) had higher mortality rates (I think this was NEJM but forget the exact citation offhand), or for a second example that mortality rates go down in hospitals when cardiologists are away at a conference (see<colon> Anupam JAMA 2014)<br><br>Interestingly, although income, education, race, and so on are all associated with health at an aggregate level (ie being poor, being in a marginalized racial group, being uneducated all tend very strongly to be bad for health), there are exceptions. Sometimes we can use these exceptions to see the independent strength of one factor. In the US, being a high school dropout is bad for infant mortality (your children are more likely to die in the first year of life if you<sq>re uneducated). However, having a college education and being African American still leads to a higher (aggregate) risk of infant mortality than for white high school dropouts. In this one statistics we can see the way race has an effect on health that appears to more than counteract education. In the same way, Americans smoke far less than other rich countries, yet Japan has much better health than us (or essentially anyone) despite smoking far more than us (and basically anyone else among OECD countries). This isn<sq>t to suggest that smoking is healthy, but rather than some other aspects of being within America are so bad that they more than counteract our low smoking prevalence (or, alternatively, being in Japan is so good that smoking doesn<sq>t seem to harm them in the same way). The last thing I<sq>ll say here is that perhaps the most fascinating exception to invoke is the <dq>Latino Paradox<dq>, in which those of hispanic ethnicity in America tend to enjoy some of the best health outcomes, despite largely being within a marginalized racial group, despite language and educational disadvantages, and so on ... the usual rules of what makes for good or bad health appear to apply less (or be counteracted) because of some other factor. Many have suggested (but not all experts are convinced) that cohesion and social support within Hispanic culture accounts for the paradox. There is a lot of evidence to show that social support has a very strong effect on mortality (see<colon> holt lundstadt 2010 and 2015 \u2014 in the 2010 metaanalysis they show the effect or low social support to be equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day in terms of mortality within 5 years, and this is an n=300,000+ sample). <br><br>Reddit is telling me I am over the max character limit.

It deals with states with different representation in congress. It doesn<sq>t restrict any influence, but it does enhance the influence of lesser populated states.<br><br>>2) Is this its intended purpose? If not, what is the purpose of the Electoral College?<br><br>Yes. The purpose of the electoral college was to <dq>simulate<dq> a joint sitting between both houses of congress, without using the actual representatives. This was done to avoid <dq>intrigue<dq>, which is probably what they had witnessed in Britain<sq>s parliamentary system.<br><br>https<colon>//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._68<br><br>>3) What happens to the Electoral College if First Past the Post voting rules are removed at the state level? e.g. a state<sq>s electoral votes are divided according to the state<sq>s popular vote, rather than cast as a block. Does this render the Electoral College defunct and/or undermine its raison d<sq>etre? Does it make the presidential election more similar to a national FPP popular vote?<br><br>Personally, this is the avenue I favour. It does bring it somewhat in line with the popular vote, while retaining increased influence for smaller states. What it does is remove the concept of <dq>swing states<dq> as all states will have variable outcomes. <br><br>>4) Do I correctly understand the linked video? I believe the video asserts that the Electoral College does NOT ensure that the President is elected by a broad consensus among the states. Rather, the Electoral College gives preference to highly populated states. On the surface this means that states with densely populated urban areas have more electoral power. In actuality that power can be involuntarily transferred to rural areas due to FPP, provided they win a slim majority and there are no Faithless Electors. Which somehow makes cities simultaneously more powerful but also less powerful?<br><br>Yes. The worst off are rural voters in large states. I think its worth considering what it means to have <dq>influence<dq> in this mode of election. There is obviously increased voting power for smaller states but there is also <dq>campaign efficiency<dq> for larger states. That is, a candidate can attract more voters for less time, effort and money in more densely populated areas. Thus, this incentivizes candidates to focus on urban areas. The electoral apportionment attempts to blunt the effects of this.<br><br>>5) What point is the meme at 1<colon>30 trying to convey and does the video directly address it?<br><br>I think he<sq>s pointing out that the split between rural and urban votes correlates with ideology. And that increased urbanisation will lead to a monopoly which will safely ignore rural voters.<br><br>>6) To whom does the Electoral College give an advantage in an election? This is my ultimate underlying confusion. Who is more powerful in the current system? Rural voters? Urban voters? Swing state voters regardless of demography? At this point I<sq>d be satisfied to learn that the Electoral College is deliberately engineered to empower slave-owners, just so long as I finally know who is running the show.<br><br>Swing voters are more powerful by far.<br><br>The college has nothing to do with slavery, as at this point it was only the original 13 colonies and the issue of slavery was far less contentious.</p>",

It managed to recover modestly in the mid-20s, after several political and economic catastrophies (hyperinflation, political assassinations, attempted coups and revolutions, Ruhr area occupation by France) hitting their peak in 1923, but in 1929 the financial crisis hit and sent the German economy into a tailspin again. After the democratic parties failed to keep a broad government coalition together, a quick succession of President-appointed cabinets failed to solve much until Hitler was appointed and quickly established a dictatorship. Nazi Germany financed its rearmament and infrastructure spending via massive debts in the lead-up to WWII that was to be repaid with war spoils. After WWII, Germany was totally bombed out and lay in physical and economic ruins, but was full of skilled workers that lived in higher concentration than pre-war due to the smaller borders and forced resettlement. In light of the looming US-Soviet conflict, the US decided to support the rebuilding of Europe via the [Marshall plan](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_plan), loans to European countries in severe economic trouble after the war. The investment (but more importantly, political and economic integration with the West and the US which was largely unharmed by the war and economically in a good position), the skilled labor, and the massive need for rebuilding all created the post-war [<dq>economic miracle<dq>](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder), with cheap, high-quality German manufacturing export to the Western bloc becoming a powerful economic motor that lead Germany to renewed economic power.

Because churches in the US, are most people\u2019s most important civic organization, they link political life to social life, pro- moting civic virtues, community and charitable service, and organiza- tional skills (e.g., volunteer work, fundraising), and enhancing political consciousness (albeit in several possible directions). Religious affiliation forges social connectedness and dense, cooperative networks that allow members to practice such skills and generate **social capital.** In the rapidly growing suburbs and exurbs in which most megachurches are located, these ties are central to many people\u2019s overall happiness and quality of life. [35-36, emphasis mine]<br><br>3 - megachurches offer a lot of different services in one place, making them appealing and easy to join<br><br>>Moreover, megachurches are well positioned to take advantage of economies of scale in the provision of religious as well as social services (Stonebraker 1993). Most offer modern architecture and ample parking, book stores, cafes and food courts, sports facilities, recreational outlets, and ancillary services such as psychological counseling, religious educa- tion classes, choirs, day-care facilities, or youth outreach programs, and often broadcast on local public-access television stations (Fitzgerald 2007). Typically, they offer a welcoming environment that makes it easy for \u2018\u2018seekers\u2019\u2019 to join.<br><br>(in addition)  <br>4 - megachurches offer a broad and agreeable religious message<br><br>>Many offer \u2018\u2018toned down,\u2019\u2019 undemanding, multi- denominational approaches centered on positive spiritual, therapeutic messages rather than the guilt-laden doctrines characteristic of many traditional (especially Protestant) denominations. Services tend to the spectacular, with impressive use of lights and electronic music rather than hellfire-and-brimstone preaching, and encourage casual dress codes, making attendance as much a social event as a spiritual one (Axtman 2003). [36]<br><br>and <br><br>>Black megachurches, such as T.D. Jakes\u2019 The Potter\u2019s House and Creflo Dollar\u2019s World Changers, use many of these strategies to attract congregants, but have gained much attention by preaching what has come to be called the \u2018\u2018prosperity gospel,\u2019\u2019 which emphasizes financial success over theological purity. [37]<br><br>5 - megachurches have had success in using contemporary media as a way of growth<br><br>>As Fitzgerald (2007, p. 48) notes, \u2018\u2018Megachurches have developed as they have in part because most of their pastors aim to attract people from a variety of religious backgrounds.\u2019\u2019 Many megachurches are explicitly and aggressively multi-ethnic in character, and in their efforts to enlarge their congregation, often display these qualities on the Internet through elaborate webpages, podcasts, and YouTube videos. <br>Although megachurches do their best to establish close personal ties with their followers, critics frequently bemoan the loss of intimacy that they may entail. One may point to their ability to adapt religion to a culture in which entertainment has become the standard to which all discourses must aspire (Postman 1985), a view that underscores the appeal of televangelists and \u2018\u2018gospel entrepreneurs.<br><br>6 - megachurches are attractive from a politically conservative standpoint  <br>(or to put it another way)  <br>an arguable increase in interest in conservative politics and values translates to an interest in megachurch communities<br><br>>The popularity of megachurches also reflects, among other factors, the increased visibility and power of conservative religious forces (Wilcox 1992; Hackett 2003; Heineman 1998; Phillips 2006). Much of the debate in this regard centers on issues such as prayer in the schools, reproductive rights and contraception, sex education, tolerance of homosexuality, the teaching of evolution, stem cell research, and a variety of other important topics that are often loosely lumped under the phrase \u2018\u2018moral values.\u2019\u2019 Such issues often assume political prominence among an economically dis- tressed middle class<colon> as Jacobs (2006) notes, the marriage of political and religious conservatives occurred precisely at the historic moment in which American economic and political hegemony was contested internationally, a moment in which multiculturalism and the postmodern relativity of moral values achieved widespread popularity. As a result, religion has become one of the most striking and important dimensions of US, politics, rivaling or exceeding the significance of class, race, or gender in deter- mining electoral turnout and outcomes. Megachurches are important moments in the intersections of religion and conservative politics in the US, Aleksic (2007) suggests that \u2018\u2018the megachurch can in fact be characterized as an ideal community of the American Christian Right<colon> a planned collective environment governed in accordance not only with evangelical church doctrine, but also with a conservative social and political ethos.\u2019\u2019 While many megachurches are open-minded in their approach to theological issues and do not subscribe to narrow interpre- tations of Christian doctrine, most are politically conservative, although not all engage in overtly political behavior.</p>",

As opposed to reading a bible passage  and then it<sq>s up to you to determine how it fits in your life.<br><br>>Megachurches offer a unique way of being religious in modern society; one that fits the social and religious context of many people. These large churches also create a distinctive symbolic presence as local congregations in contemporary society. Massive congregations of two to fifteen thousand participants occupy an undeniable space in the religious and social landscape. It is not just their prominent location, massive buildings, countless ministries, or television programs that give these churches their high visibility. It is also their vision of playing an role in changing society which both attracts attention and functions as part of their appeal. These congregations preach a message of action and empowerment to their membership. Their goal is to make a difference in individual lives, in the local community, and in the world. It is the rhetoric, and often the reality, that these churches are actively engaged in reshaping their social context which is appealing to members .<br><br>Further manipulation that the mega church is <dq>accomplishing<dq> something.

Hopefully that<sq>ll make this comment passable.<br><br>On anonymity<colon><br><br>> These large churches, by allowing for anonymity and choice, draw some persons to church who never would come otherwise. As one writer said about Willow Creek, <dq>seekers can be anonymous here. You don<sq>t have to say anything, sing anything, sign anything, or give anything<dq> (Chandler 1989<colon>A28). In fact, many people want to remain anonymous. Hybels<sq> survey found this to be one of the primary components unchurched persons wanted in a worship service (Olson 1988<colon>192). Other members use the private space to recover from burnout or over commitment (Neff 1990). Several megachurch members echoed one woman<sq>s comment about her involvement, <dq>I hung around for several years, just resting, before I got involved.<dq><br><br>On small groups and organization<colon><br><br>> A number of social observers have suggested that megachurches resemble shopping malls in their wide array of consumer-driven ministerial offerings (Niebuhr 1995a; Eiesland 1995; Schaller 1992; Ostling 1991). The megachurch functions like the mall owner providing stability and a common roof under which diverse ministries, seen as specialized boutiques, can operate. In addition several core ministries, like anchor stores, offer a continuous draw to this spiritual shopping center (Eiesland 1995<colon>73). This organizational arrangement allows the larger church structure to remain unchanged while the lay-driven specialized offerings rise or fall depending on changing needs.<br><br>On the polished communicator<colon><br><br>> Megachurches are more often than not the product of one highly gifted spiritual leader. The majority of contemporary megachurches were either founded by or achieved mega-status within the tenure of a single senior minister (Vaughan 1993; Schaller1992). The character of these churches usually reflects the vision and personality of this one person. These pastors are usually personally charismatic, exceptionally gifted men. As senior minister, and often the church<sq>s founder, these persons occupy the singular, most prominent, high profile position in the congregation. The average length of tenure of these leaders has been estimated at 15 years (Olson 1988).<br><br>Additionally, [The Big Sort By Bill Bishop](http<colon>//www.thebigsort.com/home.php) spends a chapter on religion, and some of the social trends the led to the rise of megachurches<colon> Specifically he expounds on some of the structural issues I touched on with small groups (pg. 170-171) as theorized by Donald MacGavarn<colon><br><br>> His message to American preachers was the same advice he gave missionaries in *The Bridges of God<colon>* culture matters... Ministers everywhere should design their church for a culturally defined <dq>homogeneous unit.<dq> he advised. ... They took an anthropological interest in their communities, noting the kinds of music people who lived there listened to and the kinds of clothes, they wore. They designed their churches to appeal to targeted groups, demographic types.  People wouldn<sq>t be attracted to a church filled with a diverse membership, these ministers learned from MacGavran. But they would come to a church custom-built for people like themselves.<br><br>That whole chapter has some interesting ideas and numbers about how the American church changed during the late 70s and early 80s. Well worth a read if you<sq>re interested in some of the more historical, rather than purely structural differences.<br><br>----<br><br>I attended a megachurch during its evolution from a medium-large church (1000 or so on a given Sunday attending one makeshift campus at a High School) to megachurch status (something like 30k+ across 8 permanent campuses). We left that church a few years ago, and hopped around to a few different smaller more mainline churches. Here<sq>s a my thoughts on what made the megachurch a megachurch compared to the other churches. <br><br>One is definitely anonymity as you mentioned. The church I attended even makes it somewhat explicit during the service. Many evangelical churches have a greeting period during the service where you shake hands with and say good morning to the people around you, usually after the first worship song, or after worship. Some churches ask visitors to stand or raise their hands, or possibly even come up to the front of the church so that regular members can make it a point to introduce themselves to you. This church instead would say something like, <dq>We don<sq>t ask you stand up or come up front, just please check the box on your connection card (a little info card everyone fills out with contact info and prayer requests) and we give you our hassle-free guarantee. We won<sq>t call or show up on your doorstep with some baked goods. We just want to send you a letter thanking you for coming and introducing you to our church.<dq> I think they had correctly identified that the greeting process made some visitors uncomfortable and had tweaked it to eliminate some of the off-putting aspects of visiting.<br><br>In general megachurches have also streamlined, or eliminated a lot of the rigid structure in more traditional churches. I think it<sq>s both a product of managing a huge congregation, and also contributes to making it easier for people to come. A big example is megachurch small groups that often replace Sunday school in more traditional churches. There<sq>s some pretty interesting social theorizing within the church about how people attach to the church. There<sq>s a basic idea that people are more comfortable around people who share their same basic views, ideas and interests, and come attempt to structure a church so that people can have that. In megachurches you<sq>ll often see a large number of affinity small groups structured around some hobby, interest or other shared commonality. People will meet once a week, and along with a Bible study, or prayer they<sq>ll do some shared activity like hike, play frisbee, knit, etc. Other groups may specifically be for people of a certain age, or certain place in life (early adult, family groups, grandparents, etc.) Compared to traditional churches in my experience the megachurches make it easier to start and lead one of these groups, the groups cycle in and out pretty regularly, and there<sq>s a wide array of topics to choose from. The members often choose on their own what group(s) they want to attend, and can usually change at will to another group. These groups are usually much more structured in traditional churches. At our current church we were assigned to a group (although I<sq>m sure we could ask to go to a different group), and the group has a fairly continuous core group of people who have been in the group for over 10 years.<br><br>Also, OP has hit on one of the other big reasons a lot of the people end up at a megachurch, polish or performance. Usually the pastor will be a very effective communicator. Someone who can take a Bible lesson on any topic, and make it an enjoyable and educational 30 minute lesson. The church probably has a paid worship staff, possibly even professional musicians who have albums on the CCM music charts. Most megachurches will have a media team who may shoot and edit video, design graphics, and create other assets around each service. <br><br>Compared to smaller or more traditional church, hopefully, you<sq>re getting a great lesson, but it<sq>s probably not going to be delivered with same panache as the megachurch pastor can muster. It probably won<sq>t be as refined and clear, and it probably won<sq>t be as entertaining. Maybe the church will have one full or part time music minister, but the rest of the team will probably be volunteers of varying skill. If there<sq>s any particular multimedia or design work, it<sq>s likely to be either of the clipart quality, or borrowed and adapted from an outside source.<br><br>I definitely enjoyed our time at the megachurch, and really did learn and grow a lot there. I think there<sq>s some value in making it extremely frictionless for people to show up, and casually check out your church. It allows more people to hear the message than would in more traditional churches. Unfortunately in a lot of megachurches you have to be more proactive in seeking out teaching, discipleship and accountability to grow. Also, the size and anonymity can make it hard to build long term relationships within the church. The polish of a Sunday service definitely makes for an enjoyable experience, but it can also lose something when you feel like you<sq>re watching something put on by professionals, rather than worshipping with your community of friends. It can also lock out people whose calling is to serve in those roles, but don<sq>t have a professional level of talent.<br><br>I think there<sq>s room for both models under the wide tent of the Church.</p>",

A perfect example of was the recent, highly sensationalized anti-corruption and anti-crime dragnet implemented by Bo Xilai in Chongqing. This involved literally thousands of arrests, from crime bosses to minor officials to policemen with such showy stunts as Wang Lijiang, the police chief, meeting a crime boss on an airport tarmac.

This is the curious effect that roughly every decade, IQ seems to rise by about 3 points. Now, it seems unlikely that this would come about through heredity - most people do not believe that a higher intelligence leads to more offspring, in fact, more successful people seem to have fewer children. A difference of almost 10 points of IQ per generation would seem quite high anyway. A better explanation may be that the education which we give our children simply trains them to be better at IQ tests. It<sq>s still a matter of much debate what the real reason is though, with other explanations like nutrition or disease being offered. What the Flynn effect does prove, though, is that significant differences in IQ do exist in our society, differences that can definitely not be explained through heredity alone, and that may play a role in the apparent differences in IQ between <dq>races<dq>.  <br>Regarding the <dq>rich black kids have lower scores than poor white kids<dq> argument, I<sq>d like to point you to the [stereotype threat](http<colon>//www.apa.org/research/action/stereotype.aspx). Research regarding the stereotype threat seems to show that some groups, like black people and women, seem to do worse in many situations, like maths tests, when reminded of the fact that they belong to a group often viewed as inferior in these tests. While there is some controversy regarding this research, we need to remember that while money is one factor to explain differences in IQ among different groups, it is of course not the only factor. Culture, nutrition and many other factors (among them, potentially, genetics) will always play a role, and it is impossible to completely disentangle all possible influences and prove beyond any doubt which factor is truly responsible. You can<sq>t bring up human children in a sterile lab environment, and even if you let the same family raise a black child and a white child in the same environment, they will still be faced with different prejudices, may receive different amounts of attention from teachers, face different expectations from society.  <br><br>This being said, there<sq>s another important question to ask<colon>why does it even matter? Even if there are significant racial differences in IQ, we *know* that there are intelligent people and unintelligent people in every group of humans. Race is a *terrible* predictor for intelligence (and that is true even if we used a sensible definition for race - the greatest human genetic diversity exists in Africa, since all humans are descended from subgroups of the people living in Africa, so it makes little sense to view black people as one single group), so what<sq>s the point in taking someone<sq>s ancestry into account when, say, considering someone for a job? Even intelligence is a bad measure of someone<sq>s success in life, which is why we use better metrics, like grades in schools. The only thing I can think of where racial IQ might even enter the discussion is the sensibility of measures like affirmative action, where disadvantaged groups gain advantages for college admissions to counteract discrimination. The thing is though, we *know* discrimination exists, we *know* it matters for getting a job, when interacting with police and many other things. So trying to counteract discrimination is still a sensible thing even if these racial differences do exist.</p>",

In the research, we see adolescents and young adults more intelligent than older adults, but in life we do not see increasing deficits of reasoning and memory at least through the main period of adulthood, from the 30s into the 70s. We see advanced-age adults doing most of the intellectual work of maintaining and advancing the culture; we see older people who are the intellectual leaders in science, politics, business, and academics, people who are in their positions of responsibility largely because (we think) they ae--in some sense we need to define--more intelligent than younger adults and adolescents.<dq><br>><br>><br>><dq>So, there<sq>s something out of kilter here.

Not exactly what you were saying, but here<sq>s a relevant passage<colon><br><br>> When overefficient tools are applied to facilitate man<sq>s relations with the physical environment, they can destroy the balance between man and nature. Overefficient tools corrupt the environment. But tools can also be made overefficient in quite a different way. They can upset the relationship between what people need to do by themselves and what they need to obtain ready-made. In this second dimension overefficient production results in radical monopoly. <br><br>> By radical monopoly I mean a kind of dominance by one product that goes far beyond what the concept of monopoly usually implies. Generally we mean by <dq>monopoly<dq> the exclusive control by one corporation over the means of producing (or selling) a commodity or service. Coca-Cola can create a monopoly over the soft-drink market in Nicaragua by being the only maker of soft drinks which advertises with modern means. Nestl# might impose its brand of cocoa by controlling the raw material, some car maker by restricting imports of other makes, a television channel by licensing. Monopolies of this kind have been recognized for a century as dangerous by-products of industrial expansion, and legal devices have been developed in a largely futile attempt to control them. Monopolies of this kind restrict the choices open to the consumer. They might even compel him to buy one product on the market, but they seldom simultaneously abridge his liberties in other domains. A thirsty man might desire a cold, gaseous, and sweet drink and find himself restricted to the choice of just one brand. He still remains free to quench his thirst with beer or water. Only if and when his thirst is translated without meaningful alternatives into the need for a Coke would the monopoly become radical. By <dq>radical monopoly<dq> I mean the dominance of one type of product rather than the dominance of one brand. I speak about radical monopoly when one industrial production process exercises an exclusive control over the satisfaction of a pressing need, and excludes nonindustrial activities from competition. <br><br>> Cars can thus monopolize traffic. They can shape a city into their image--practically ruling out locomotion on foot or by bicycle in Los Angeles. They can eliminate river traffic in Thailand. That motor traffic curtails the right to walk, not that more people drive Chevies than Fords, constitutes radical monopoly. What cars do to people by virtue of this radical monopoly is quite distinct from and independent of what they do by burning gasoline that could be transformed into food in a crowded world. It is also distinct from automotive manslaughter. Of course cars burn gasoline that could be used to make food. Of course they are dangerous and costly. But the radical monopoly cars establish is destructive in a special way. Cars create distance. Speedy vehicles of all kinds render space scarce. They drive wedges of highways into populated areas, and then extort tolls on the bridge over the remoteness between people that was manufactured for their sake. This monopoly over land turns space into car fodder. It destroys the environment for feet and bicycles. Even if planes and buses could run as nonpolluting, nondepleting public services, their inhuman velocities would degrade man<sq>s innate mobility and force him to spend more time for the sake of travel.<br><br>EDIT<colon>  another quote<br><br>> The first palliative is consumer protection. Consumers cannot do without cars. They buy different makes. They discover that most cars are unsafe at any speed. So they organize to get safer, better, and more durable cars and to get more as well as wider and safer roads. Yet when consumers gain more confidence in cars, the victory only increases society<sq>s dependence on high-powered vehicles-public or private-and frustrates even more those who have to, or would prefer to, walk.<br><br>> While the organized self-protection of the addict-consumer immediately raises the quality of the dope and the power of the peddler, it also may lead ultimately to limits on growth. Cars may finally become too expensive to purchase and medicines too expensive to test. By exacerbating the contradictions inherent in this institutionalization of values, majorities can more easily become aware of them. Discerning consumers who are discriminatory in their purchasing habits may finally discover that they can do better by doing things for themselves.</p>",

The vast majority of research on interracial relationships centers on the black male-white female dynamic, generational attitudes towards interracial dating, the perspective of white women and on the experience of the *couple*. It<sq>s hard to find anything just looking at black women or white men. <br><br>Erica Chito Childs conducted a qualitative research [study](http<colon>//www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30044616?uid=3739864&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21102141608571) (can<sq>t find available full-text) with focus groups comprised of black college-aged women. She also conducted in-depth interviews with black women currently in relationships with white men. There are significant limitations with this kind of study since you can<sq>t just generalize from the experiences of a few women but it can be a good method for drawing out common themes and going in-depth in a way surveys don<sq>t. The women\u2019s responses fell into three broad categories<colon> concerns about marrying white men, concerns about the impact of interracial marriage on the black community, and concerns with maintaining their own personal identity.<br><br>According to Childs\u2019 respondents, the central problem with interracial marriage is racism from whites. The black women were more accepting of black female-white male unions than black male-white female unions, but many perceived active hostility on the part of white men. Some of the women were apprehensive about dating or marrying whites because they did not feel they could trust a white male partner to be non-racist, and experiencing racism from a partner would make intimacy impossible. They did not know if they could trust the motives of white men because they believed white men often see black women as exotic, or as one woman put it, <dq>a novelty<dq> (p. 555). <br><br>In Childs<sq> study, Black women who had experienced interracial relationships and those who never had both expressed concerns over the impact of interracial marriage on the solidarity of the black community. One woman who had dated and married several white men pointed to the greater importance of maintaining active presence in black community if dating interracially. The participants also stressed matters of personal identity and the need for solidarity and self-acceptance. One woman said she did not want to be <dq>less black<dq> (p. 551) or try to be white as a betrayal of self. The women willing to date white men were significantly older.<br><br>Trying to find something from the white male perspective I came across this research by Matthijs Kalmijn<colon> [<dq>Trends in black/white intermarriage<dq>](http<colon>//www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/Classic_Media/Kalmijn_1993_Race<percent>20and<percent>20Ethnicity.pdf). It<sq>s interesting for some of the historical data it includes. For one thing, during slavery and through the Civil Rights era black female-white male relationships were much more the norm and black male-white female was the outlier. Nowadays, the white men least likely to marry black women are also the most educated. Kalmijn explains this phenomenon using social exchange theory, concluding that white men would perceive marrying black women as \u201cmarrying down\u201d in terms of class. <br><br>EDIT TO ADD<colon> As a peer-reviewed companion piece to the OKCupid data cited earlier, there is Robnett and Feliciano<sq>s [<dq>Patterns of racial-ethnic exclusion by internet daters<dq>](http<colon>//sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/3/807.short) (again, sorry no link to full-text).

So Paogate might not fit the definition exactly, but we<sq>ll just pretend that none of that stuff exists just because Reddit is a part of a different kind of medium.<br><br>Anyhoo, the five key features that Garland finds on another text are<colon><br><br>> (i) concern (some reported conduct or event sparks anxiety); (ii) hostility (the perpetrators are portrayed as folk devils); (iii) consensus (the negative social reaction is broad and uni\ufb01ed); (iv) disproportionality (the extent of the conduct, or the threat it poses, are exaggerated); (v) volatility (the media\u2019s reporting and the associated panic emerge suddenly, but can dissipate quickly too). (p. 11)<br><br>One and two are extremely clear throughout, the hostility part being really evident in all those Chairman Pao posters. Three is a matter of debate, because it seems like Ellen Pao had pockets of very fervent support, and a whole many people were indifferent to the whole thing or were more worried about pointing out the exaggeration in the response than about joining the panic. Five is definitely true (after FatPeopleHate was banned, the first page of /r/all was nothing but fat people hate posts and Ellen Pao posts... for a day).<br><br>But number four is the most notable of them all because the disproportionality of the reaction to Pao<sq>s actions is intimately linked to the two criteria that Garland himself adds to these five. The new criteria are<colon><br><br>> (i) the moral dimension of the social reaction, particularly the introspective soul-searching that accompanies these episodes; and (ii) the idea that the deviant conduct in question is somehow symptomatic.<br><br>So of course, there was a moral dimension (<dq>Pao is against free speech!<dq>) and whatever actions were taken by Reddit<sq>s admins were made to be a symptom of a larger problem (<dq>Reddit is going full SJW!<dq>).<br><br>So, to cut this short - maybe you didn<sq>t have an academic definition in mind while asking the question - I sure didn<sq>t know such definitions actually existed (even though they seem very useful now that I read Garland), but it<sq>s interesting that reddit<sq>s reaction to fatpeoplehate being banned and to Victoria being fired fit the definition of a moral panic kinda snugly.</p>",

Even for Josephus, I<sq>ve seen somewhat convincing arguments that the Jesus passages were added in by Christians much later.<br><br>Here<sq>s my explanation of how historians arrive at the idea that Jesus of Nazereth probably existed, taken from an earlier [thread](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/s1jx9/another_poll_on_glenn_becks_website_this_time/c4ag2k9)<colon><br><br>I<sq>ve seen this argument (exist/doesn<sq>t exist) a million times over on reddit. Here<sq>s as clear of an explanation as I can give as to why I think Jesus of Nazereth was a real dude<colon><br><br>**Things we<sq>re pretty sure of<colon>**<br><br>* The Pauline epistles from the Bible describe a community that exalted one guy named Jesus. They were probably written in the 50s, 20 years after the alleged death of Jesus of Nazereth. Paul probably never met a guy named Jesus, but he was probably old enough to meet people who met Jesus, if he existed. Many of the latter epistles were probably written by people other than Paul, in cities along the Mediterranean.<br><br>* The canonical gospels were probably written in this order<colon> Mark, then Luke and Matthew, then John. At best guess, Mark was written around 70AD, 40 years after Jesus<sq> alleged death. The others were written later. They were probably not written by anyone who were eyewitnesses to the events described (a few scholars disagree about this, but they tend to have more faith-based points of view).<br><br>* The Gospels themselves were written based on an older <sq>oral tradition<sq> that described the life of a guy named Jesus, plus anything the gospel-writers felt the need to add.<br><br>* Josephus mentions Jesus around 93AD. There<sq>s a chance this passage was added by Christians later, but even if it wasn<sq>t, it only tells us what we already know<colon> Christian communities that worshiped Jesus existed by 90AD. Not very useful.<br><br>**Things that may be true<colon>**<br><br>* We can, by looking at the Bible very closely, figure out which parts were likely part of early Christian beliefs and oral traditions, and what came later. This is obviously not an exact science, but here are some of the ways it<sq>s done<colon><br><br>*What ideas go against the grain of normal Jewish/Hellenistic society? Basically, what would be the hardest pills for potential converts to swallow? These ideas are less likely to be <sq>made up<sq> by people with an agenda, because their agenda wouldn<sq>t get very far. Ideas that reflect mainstream Jewish/Hellenistic values were more likely to have been added later to help recruit converts, appease authorities, etc.*<br><br>*What ideas/details are consistent across the Gospels? If they all share these ideas, they are likely to be a part of the oral tradition, or at least go back to Mark. If they disagree, they were probably changed/added later, possibly to deal with theological disputes or with other inconsistencies. This is why most details of the crucifixion narrative, the birth narrative, etc. are heavily doubted if not thrown out by Biblical scholars.*<br><br>*What ideas are <sq>novel<sq>, when compared to Jewish theology of the time?*<br><br>* When hundreds of Biblical, Jewish and early Christian scholars do this over an extended period of time, they get a general picture. The most parsimonious and popular theory goes like this<colon> at some point around the 30sAD, there was a charismatic teacher who rejected a number of things about Judaism and Hellinistic society. This included a bunch of purity laws (working on the Sabbath, touching the sick and the dead, associating with beggars and prostitutes), material wealth and possessions, and conventional family structures. These teachings got attached to a guy named Jesus by people who would have been around when he was alive; they formed the earliest Christian communities.<br><br>* Much of the theology that got layered on top was similar to <sq>mystery cults<sq> (like Mithras), Jewish messianic theology, and Hellenistic values (that<sq>s how all those <dq>women should be subordinate, slavery is awesome<dq> parts got in there).<br><br>**What we can speculate about<colon>**<br><br>* Was Jesus one guy or multiple guys who got blended into one man? Either is possible, but I think it makes more sense to say that there was one Jewish dude who took a lot of ideas that may have been floating around and started a movement. His name probably wasn<sq>t changed by his followers, so it was probably a guy named Yeshua/Joshua.<br><br>* Why wasn<sq>t Jesus mentioned by anyone at the time? This a good question, probably coming down to the fact that he didn<sq>t actually perform any miracles (so he wasn<sq>t all that miraculous), he didn<sq>t try to incite any rebellions (so he wasn<sq>t as much of a hassle to the authorities), he hung out mostly with the poor/outcasts (so he didn<sq>t rub shoulders with the elites, who were more likely to write stuff down), and his movement was one of many radical religious groups at the time.<br><br>* The thing that amazes me about the people who go on about the lack of mention of Jesus in historical documents is that they<sq>re constantly pointing to sources that occur after 50AD. We have really good evidence that there were Christian communities by then, yet these <sq>authorities<sq> don<sq>t even mention them. If they don<sq>t bother mentioning whole communities that we know to have existed, why would we expect them to mention their founders?<br><br>Naturally, this argument isn<sq>t air-tight. People who want to remain <sq>agnostic<sq> about his existence are, to my mind, making a safe bet. But people who use the silence in historical documents, plus an out-right dismissal of the Bible as any form of evidence, to say he probably didn<sq>t exist are just using wishful thinking.<br><br><br></p>",

I<sq>ve worked for some of them, and I can tell you that Rwanda is one of the outstanding <sq>success stories<sq> for many of the projects, because of its lack of corruption in the country. <br><br>Burundi, by contrast, went on a different path post 1994. It has not erased the difference between Hutu and Tutsi. Instead, it has institutionalized the difference, by allocating seats for each group in parliament. The politics of Burundi are still to a large extent determined by group identity, and as a result, its political leadership can stay in power simply by promoting, rather than eradicating, clientalism and corruption. As a result, the country has been unable to attract as much foreign aid, and the foreign aid it does get, has not been spent nearly as efficiently. <br><br>So, in summary<colon> Burundi has maintained a political system of group identity and clientalism, which has led to a vicious cycle of corruption, little foreign aid, inefficient government spending, and stagnant economic development. Rwanda<sq>s leadership, effectively composed of a paranoid but driven minority within in a minority, has had to deliver economic growth and security in order to stay in power.

                "answer": "<p>It<sq>s often called <dq>cosmopolitanism<dq>, though that<sq>s generally seen as virtue rather than a vice.  I study both urban and rural communities and so see the <dq>cosmopolitanism<dq> of the social sciences as a sort of <dq>parochialism<dq>. Look at this set of advice for sociology graduate students called <dq>[Regard Yourself as a Writer](http<colon>//qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~hlevine/Regard-Yourself-As-A-Writer.pdf)<dq>.  Describing what sociology is, the writer, Harry Levine of CUNY, says<colon><br><br>>In *Invitation to Sociology<colon> A Humanistic Perspective*, Peter Berger says that sociology is defined neither by what it studies, nor by its theories or methods. He says sociology is distinguished by its *perspectives*, especially its mistrust of conventional knowledge and the taken for granted. In his chapter \u201cSociology As A Form Of Consciousness,\u201d Berger boldly offers what he calls <dq>the first wisdom of sociology.<dq> It is<colon> \u201c*things are not as they seem*.\u201d<br><br>>Berger then identifies four motifs he finds central in sociological writing. He calls these<colon> *debunking* (unmasking, revealing the truth about something); *unrespectability* (looking at the world from the perspective of the unrespectables, the underdogs); *relativizing* (understanding that almost everything depends on context); **and *cosmopolitanism (*an appreciation for the city and human diversity)**. I love being in a field with those values. All are essential, but I think debunking is most important. I suggest that good sociologists are good story tellers who show that things are not as they seem.<br><br>Sociology has been so-focused on urbanism that it<sq>s been historically unclear whether rural sociology is a part of sociology or its own discipline. For a history of this split, see this unpublished paper<colon> <dq>[The Institutional and Intellectual Origins of Rural Sociology](http<colon>//www.ag.auburn.edu/~bailelc/Smith.2011.pdf)<dq>. <br><br>Edit<colon> rural sociology is a weird discipline, but one of the best pieces of rural sociology is the *Bachelor<sq>s Ball* by Pierre Bourdieu (originally in French, available in translation in a variety of languages). Bourdieu is one of the most important post-War social scientists, and this book is fascinating. It<sq>s about his home region of Bearn, in an out of the way corner of France. He interviews people in the local dialect, and often sometimes had his father introduce them because he has strong ties in the community because he<sq>s lived there his whole life. It<sq>s all about how the younger sons are trapped on the land as farmers, and they have a hard time getting married or getting respect. The book is structured in three parts written at three different points in his career. The first section is great anthropology conducted in the 1950<sq>s or 60<sq>s. The second section is garbage post-modernism written in the 70<sq>s or 80<sq>s (skip it). And the third part is from the 90<sq>s and fits all the early observations into the rest of his fully developed theoretical work (probably most interesting if you<sq>re a social scientist, the first part stands on its own). <br><br>There<sq>s also *Saints, Scholars and Schitzophrenics*, which is about those left behind by urbanization in rural Ireland. It was a controversial book at the time, getting quite a bit of media attention in Ireland when it was first published. The author argues that many people left behind in the country are noticeably mentally ill, but that this doesn<sq>t really make much difference in rural life, and the community looks after them. <br><br>Unfortunately, much recent rural sociology (and to a much lesser degree anthropology) has either been focused on <dq>developmental sociology<dq> (how to improve areas of the global south) or has been <dq>environmental sociology<dq>, examining people<sq>s interaction with the (not necessarily separate) natural world. Those two books aren<sq>t the most recent social scientific takes on rural European societies, but they<sq>re influential ones. Unfortunately, there hasn<sq>t been much qualitative work on rural Europe and there<sq>s been even less on rural America (much of American rural sociology is quant driven and has focused on health or the life course). Also, as urbanization has slowed, I<sq>m not sure there<sq>s been any good work on that gap between rural and urban/suburban life. There<sq>s this post-Soviet ethnography called *Everything was Forever, Until It Was No More*, and while that book doesn<sq>t cover rural life, it is sort of the feeling you get reading rural sociology. In the 1930<sq>s and 40<sq>s, studying small towns and rural areas was as common as studying city neighborhoods, and then, suddenly, in the post war industrial era, all the studies of the countryside emphasize decay, coincidentally (or not) that all these studies of the city are emphasizing that the slum is not really disordered. Perhaps there will be, or already, a good reevalution of this literature that emphasizes a different evaluation of rural life in the post industrial west (environmental sociology like*Childerley*, maybe, but that<sq>s about an exurb not really a rural area), but if there is I don<sq>t know it. </p>",

While the hippie bands were there, they were all relegated to the secondary stages with day slots. The major performers in the major time slots were almost all nu-metal, rock, rap acts. It had a heavy MTV presence and felt more like Spring Break with 200k people, but no real rules or security<br><br>This was the first of it<sq>s kind. There was Woodstock 94 and Lollapalooza, but nothing at this size. The organizers were ill equipped to deal with the needs involving infrastructure (like maintaining porta-porties, security). And I feel they cut corners in every possible way. A sociologist could better chime in on how when the systems like that break down that would affect behavior. <br><br>While security was tight getting in and out of the gates, it was generally non existent within the venue. It was everything goes once inside. It<sq>s been awhile but I don<sq>t remember seeing much of a security presence inside excluding to protect the stages/VIP/Band areas. Rumors of the rapes started on day one. My tent was even broken into and robbed on day two. I got there the night before but the town and traffic infrastructure was crippled by day one. People waited all night to get into just parking, often times miles away form the venue. Rules about what was allowed in was not clear, so people who had dragged all theirs food and water were forced to ditch it in big piles at the gates. Some food was allowed in but it was very stringent. The big one being no glass, which is common but was not really explicitly stated before hand.  We were parked close enough that we could go back to our vehicle for food and we could take our pick from the piles of confiscated food as we walked in and out. The alcohol was all taken home by security though.<br><br>Come to think of it, security was pretty corrupt. We got our wristbands from someone who had bought a bulk stack from a security guard. I do also remember my friend got in a run-in with security regarding an illegal substance. He bribed his way out, with an exchange of said substance. He also ended up getting the same guard to sell him a security T-Shirt. There were rumors that the security had all been hired and brought up from NYC. Many of them were pretty hood. Look into the [Altamount Hells Angels-As-Security incident](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamont_Free_Concert) to learn as to why hiring gangs  for security is a generally bad idea.  <br><br>It also happened to be a heat wave where every day was above 100. There was minimal shade anywhere. The water for sale was overpriced and the only free water available was limited to a few sporadic faucets. By the end of day one, people out of frustration of hour long lines busted the pipes so water just spewed out. The organizers should have seen the issue and trucked in water. They did not, from my recollection. <br><br>Next were the porta-potties. There simply wear not enough trucks to clean them fast enough. Fecal matter also likes to expand and overflow like blobby poo monsters out of the hole, especially under high heat. Those things were baking. By day three they were all unusable. People just had to resort to drastic measures. Trash was also not being picked up. The trash piles became a good place to shit. <br><br>So the whole thing started to get this Escape from LA feel by the second day, especially since all the trash cans were procured for the massive trash can drum circle that went non-stop the entire time, including through the riots. That was actually pretty cool. You could here it from everywhere. <br><br>Also everywhere were groups of dudes with signs saying <dq>Show us your boobs!<dq> getting women to flash them. That<sq>s another weird thing I have not see at that level at other festivals I<sq>ve been to. I might still have one of those signs-I picked one off the ground when we left as a souvenir. I<sq>ll look-I know it was buried in a box still at least for awhile.<br><br>So by the end people were hot, frustrated, tired, and on the tail end of booze and drug fueled benders. They also felt no real presence of rules and security. The closing main act was the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Flea was naked. That was sweet. There was always a no fire rule, for safety but people had started a few bonfires throughout the main music area. Again, nothing was done at first as there just wasn<sq>t a strong security presence. One of the fires caught an empty semi truck trailer on fire. So this is where the fire department and police stepped in with force. The fire trucks came in with cops in full riot and SWAT gear on ATVs and stuff (whihc came out of nowhere) and started pushing the crowds out of the main stage area. They were not polite. These were small town cops that have had their little town of Rome, NY overwhelmed for the last four days. They then continued to try and push everyone out of the other music areas into the camp grounds. They cut off the <dq>rave<dq> stage which pissed people off more. <br><br>There were lots of lingerers back in the main area, and I wandered back there out of curiosity. A saw an altercation  with a group of people and some police so I went over watch. I was at this point so nihilistic about the whole. Thing I just thought it was fascinating to watch this shit show unfold. So cops on ATVS and a plain clothes cop were corralling this crowd away and some drunk kid throws a beer bottle then and it pegs the plain clothes cop right in the head! The cop immediately pepper sprays the kids and all his friends. I specifically remember a MTV camera man right there getting close and filming. I can<sq>t for the life of me find the footage. And I looked. Who knows if it still exists somewhere. So everyone gets mad and starts throwing stuff at the cops. And this is back by the vendors. Looting may have already began but this ever larger growing group started right then. I did not do any looting. I ran around and watched a group of people dragging an ATM away. I followed and saw them trying to break it open. I specifically remember a guy getting on top of it and yelling, <dq>If we get this thing open, only take what has been taken from you!<dq> They didn<sq>t seem to be having much luck so I decided to go back to camp. Another highlight of the riots was the massive glowstick war. Thousands of glowsticks were being flung through the air. It was this surreal post-apocalyptic feel. They were one<sq>s people had, and all the ones looted from the vendors. I feel bad for the small vendors, but everyone felt the indignation about how it was all the system against the concert goers.<br><br>We slept for a few hours and left at dawn. The place was a wasteland. Most people left overnight. The whole things was totally fucked and the vendors never deserved to be looted and of course there should never had been a system set up to allow and encourage the sexual assault. I can only imagine how many went unreported/unseen.  But it was quite an experience. I was not really into drinking at the time so my memory is better than many of the festival concert goers, but I am going of memory of something that happened 15 years ago so my timeline might be off.  <br><br><br>So the theoretical explanations? From a psychological perspective, people were encouraging each other to behave in those violent ways. The system was not set up to control the culture of booze fueled behavior. Frustration leads to displaced aggression and attempted retaliation against perceived punishers, and if not available then you displace the aggression. <br><br>Edit<colon> Sorry for the typos.

Bribery and other small-scale corruption by government officials is most prevalent in poor countries. Government officials usually make a pitiful wage but have legal power, so supplement their income through bribery. Frequently, in countries where anti-corruption policies are put in place, corruption shifts from rent-seeking behavior to other forms of corruption, like nepotism.

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m guessing you mean a <sq>rebellious phase<sq> in adolescence. In that case, no. An influential theory in this regard is the <sq>maturity gap<sq> theory by Terrie Moffitt [(source)](http<colon>//psycnet.apa.org.proxy.library.uu.nl/journals/rev/100/4/674/)  In short, this theory states that rebellious or antisocial behaviour is the result of a <sq>maturity gap<sq>, that is, a discrepancy between physical maturity and social maturity. In adolescence, the body starts to change into an adult body. However, the privileges and roles that come with being an adult are not available until later. In many Western societies, the maturity gap is growing bigger because the onset of puberty is shifting to a younger age, while traditional markers of <dq>adult life<dq> (such as marriage and childbirth) are postponed until later in life.<br><br>Now to answer your question - in some cultures (e.g. more traditional African cultures), children are already given adult roles at a young age. These children don<sq>t experience a maturity gap and, therefore, teenage rebelliousness is not common.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I would argue that the answer to this question would be a mix of yes and no. While I am not familiar with Terrie Moffitt<sq>s work I believe that in order for you to get a complete understanding of the rebellious behaviour exhibited during adolescence you must consider the cognitive changes that are occurring within the brain. These cognitive changes lead the adolescent to be in a sense \u201cpredisposed\u201d to rebellious/deviant behaviour. Although there are many important changes that occur I\u2019ll discuss three which I believe are the most influential.<br><br><br>Research has shown <dq>during adolescence there is an increase in the activity of the neural circuits utilizing dopamine, a neurotransmitter central in creating our drive for reward (Siegel 67).  As a result dopamine pathways are activated much easier which leads to increased sensitivity. For example if an adolescent and an adult we<sq>re both engaging in the same dopamine producing activity the adolescent would get a more pleasurable feeling then the adult. Siegel continues <dq>research even suggests that the baseline level of dopamine is lower<dq> (Siegel 67). As you can imagine the combination of the lower dopamine baseline and increased dopamine sensitivity can lead to an increase in both impulsivity and risk taking behaviours resulting in increased rebellious/deviant behaviour. <br><br><br>Furthermore it has been shown that the amygdala has an effect on rebellious/deviant behaviour. The amygdala is the flight/fight and emotional processor of our brain. Although the author goes into further detail there are two main routes that go from the amygdala to the prefrontal cortex, one fast and one slow. <dq>Studies of adolescents reveal that even under calm conditions, the fast route to amygdala activation occurs more readily in teens than in adults; the slow route is used more often in adults\u201d (Siegel 107). Therefore it is easy to see that when presented with a surprising emotional situation the adolescent is more likely then the adult to react in a rash emotional way. <br><br><br>Lastly and most importantly attention must be drawn to the changes going on in the prefrontal cortex. \u201cThe prefrontal cortex is the brain\u2019s chief executive officer, responsible for higher cognitive level skills, like thinking ahead, evaluating the costs and benefits of different choices, and coordinating emotions and thoughts\u201d (Steinberg 76). The period of adolescence is a time of great change in the prefrontal cortex. During the period of adolescence two specific things happen in the prefrontal cortex; myelination and synaptic pruning. It\u2019s enough to say that they essentially allow our brain to become faster, more efficient, and more integrated (can recruit different parts of brain to help in task). As a result the prefrontal cortex becomes more powerful and better able to think of the future consequences and therefore lead to less rebellious actions.<br><br><br>Therefore through considering the role of each of cognitive change separately and then realizing that these changes are occurring all at the same time it is easy to see the possible contribution  to deviant behaviour. Sorry for the essay but I just read both Steinberg\u2019s Age of Opportunity and Siegel\u2019s Brainstorm which both talk in great depth about the topics discussed in this thread. Would definitely recommend them both as they will make you reconsider everything you knew about adolescence. <br><br><br>Sources; <br><br>Age of Opportunity, Laurence Steinberg, Ph.D<br>Brainstorm, Daniel Siegel M.D. </p>",

This [source](http<colon>//www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2008/10/haircuts_and_history_50s_black.html) talks about the first black barbershop, which was opened in 1830! They were important to the community because during the era of de facto and de jure segregation, they were a place in the neighborhood where a black man not only was the boss, but also a licensed, professional employee. This elevated their status within the community. <br><br>Basically, they were some of the few places where blacks had their own space. The other, of course, was the church. Because it was black owned/operated, blacks were the only clientele. They could talk about whatever they wanted without worrying about repercussions from white society. Barbershops/beauty salons were wholly black, unlike pretty much everything in society, from your apartment to the grocery store, place of work, etc. <br> <br>They were also largely divided by gender, with men going to the barbershop and women going to the beauty salon. Combined with the leisure nature of getting a hair cut, this gave a place for <dq>guy<dq> and <dq>girl<dq> time that wasn<sq>t available at the mixed church. Plus, a church doesn<sq>t allow for completely open conversation, given that it is a place of worship. <br><br>Edit<colon> Those are the historical reasons for barbershops<sq> popularity.

Also, I<sq>m kicking myself for forgetting to mention, but I highly recommend watching Chris Rock<sq>s documentary, *Good Hair*.

It is true that American society is more religious than other industrialized countries by some measures and the vast majority of Americans identify as Christian, many of those people are either not consistently practicing their religion or are part of a non-Orthodox Protestant sect (e.g. Episcopalians, Church of Christ, and other groups that tend to compromise on issues of sexuality and culture).<br><br>Furthermore the number of Christians in total have been [falling](http<colon>//www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/) while unaffiliated groups have risen. On one hand, this points to a broad secularization of American society. However, Evangelical churches are the only Christian churches that are growing. So churches where members tend to be more moderate and casual (most Protestant sects and Catholics) are on the decline while the most fervent are growing. Religious folks interpret this to mean that most Christians either don<sq>t deeply care about standing up for their beliefs, or are being pressured by a secularizing society to abandon their beliefs on cultural issues. In short, the stock of Christians is shrinking, but becoming more religious.<br><br>Because their faith is becoming increasingly countercultural, Christians are sensitive to things like media portrayal and creeping hostility in the public sphere. [Here is a study](http<colon>//mediasmarts.ca/diversity-media/religion/media-portrayals-religion-christianity) (from Canada but still relevant I think) that shows that the media tends to be more willing to criticize Christianity because it is the majority religion and they wrongly assume that they are familiar with it. Really, they are not much more familiar with it than other faiths, but only end up attacking it more, or portraying Christians as <dq>weirdos<dq> who are different from mainstream society. In a culture where casual sex and high divorce rates are seen as sometimes unfortunate side effects of a very necessary sexual revolution, it is not hard to realize that a Christian lifestyle truly does deviate from the norms that most Americans live by.<br><br>In the US of course you have seen efforts to legalize gay marriage, no fault divorce, and abortion, and heavily regulate religious organizations and activities in public domains such as schools, even when local communities approve of them.

It<sq>s a pretty short paper, and they don<sq>t go into a huge amount of analysis of the results. Essentially just stating that black children viewed the brown dolls in a negative light. They briefly propose that this is due to negative perceptions of self, or to borrow social psychological terms, negative perceptions of their ingroup. Interestingly, trends seem to be stronger in segregated schools.<br><br>For instance, children are quoted as making agreeing with the comments that the brown doll <dq>looks bad<dq> or conversely that the white doll was <dq>a nice colour.<dq>  Some of the quotes from children in the study are quite stark and blunt, with such comments as (on why they picked the white doll)<colon> <dq>cause he<sq>s pretty<dq> or <dq>cause he<sq>s white.<dq> Comments included towards the brown doll are <dq>cause he<sq>s ugly,<dq> <dq>cause it don<sq>t look pretty,<dq> <dq>cause him black<dq> or <dq>got black on him.<dq><br><br>A 1950 study done by Clark and Clark (2) looked at the same issue. But rather than dolls they got children to colour in an outline of a child (with other shapes like leaves, a mouse etc to act as ways to test that the child gets the exercise). Specifically they asked <dq>Colour her/him the colour you like little boys/girls to be.<dq> They basically found that black children **kind of** coloured themselves in the right colour, but often a shade or so lighter. Not completely white, though some did, but frequently not their actual skin colour.<br><br>In this paper they provide a proper summary. They state that they believe these trends show that there is a need to <dq>*help relieve [black] children of the tremendous burden of feelings of inadequacy and inferiority which seems to become integrated into the very structure of the personality as it is developing.*<dq> (pp. 350).<br><br>So basically, I would interpret it as arguing a kind of self-hate towards their cultural/racial group due to broader negative societal depictions and treatment, or perhaps something not quite as strong as hate. Inadequacy probably sums it up quite well, which is supported by the 1947 study which notes that white doll preference was stronger in segregated schools.

We draw this conclusion on the basis<br>of four main \u00aandings. First, data on a decade of terrorist incidents reveal a<br>strong positive relationship between the number of fatalities caused in a terror<br>attack and the likelihood of attribution. Roughly three-quarters of the attacks<br>that kill 100 people or more are **traced back to the perpetrators**. Second, attribution<br>rates are far higher for attacks on the U.S. homeland or the territory of a<br>major U.S. ally\u201497 percent (thirty-six of thirty-seven) for incidents that killed<br>ten or more people. Third, **tracing culpability from a guilty terrorist group<br>back to its state sponsor is not likely to be difficult**<colon> few countries sponsor terrorism;<br>few terrorist groups have state sponsors; each sponsored terror group<br>has few sponsors (typically one); and only one country that sponsors terrorism,<br>Pakistan, has nuclear weapons or enough fissile material to manufacture a weapon. In sum, attribution of nuclear terror incidents would be easier than is<br>typically suggested, and passing weapons to terrorists would not offer countries<br>an escape from the constraints of deterrence.<br><br>Other reasons why a state would not give nukes to a terrorist organization<colon><br><br>> Some analysts are skeptical about such sponsored nuclear terrorism, arguing<br>that a state may not be willing to deplete its small nuclear arsenal or stock of<br>precious nuclear materials. More important, a state sponsor would fear that a<br>terrorist organization might use the weapons or materials in ways the state<br>never intended, provoking retaliation that would destroy the regime.14 Nuclear<br>weapons are the most powerful weapons a state can acquire, and handing<br>that power to an actor over which the state has less than complete control<br>would be an enormous, epochal decision\u2014one unlikely to be taken by regimes<br>that are typically obsessed with power and their own survival.<br><br><br>So to conclude, the reason why terrorists haven<sq>t obtained nuclear weapons is because it is hard to obtain them (at least through development or gifting) and trying to do so would be a waste of resources.<br><br>edit<colon> Note that I didn<sq>t adress the buying/stealing of nuclear weapons (which is relevant to the <dq>loose nukes<dq> question) as I forgot.

                "answer": "<p>Finally a question that is central to my own work! But I would say that we need to think beyond the 50 states. Historically, this is more an instance of what is called <dq>settler colonialism<dq><colon> settlers go out beyond the border, kill indigenous people, set up shop for trade and, eventually, get incorporated into the state. Of course American settler colonialism is historically and culturally different from South African or Israeli or Australian settler colonialism, but its not a bad classificatory term to start from. <br><br>Instead, think the US territories such Guam or semi-protectorates such as the Dominican Republic and the global American sphere of influence in places such as the Arabian peninsula or Japan. When people speak of American Imperialism, they are often referring to facts like [the global network of military bases](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_military_bases) that underwrite American political influence and the functioning of the global economy. <br><br>But we have to start by asking what people mean when they say <dq>empire.<dq> There are, I think, several theories on this and because I have to go to work in 10 minutes I will only share three. <br><br>The first would be the neo-imperialism thesis. I think, analytically, this is the weakest thesis because it is more a rhetorical strategy. This is popular among scholars of the Middle East, however, and it has really blown up after the Iraq War. For example, Rashid Khalidi claimed, in 2004, that the invasion of Iraq was <dq>Resurrecting Empire<dq> and suggests that when Americans are ignoring the sovereignty of Middle Eastern nations they are just picking up where the British. But with the benefit of hindsight, we see that the US operated in Iraq very differently from the way the British did. (As one Iraqi told me<colon> <dq>We always wanted independence. But we respect the British. They built bridges and roads that are still here. We cannot say the same for the US<dq>)<br><br>The second would be the Empire with a capital <dq>E<dq> thesis of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. These guys claim that we need to analyze not an American empire but a network of businesses, state control, and information and surveillance technology that has become so pervasive it has acquired an agency and force of its own. The US certainly enforces this Empire, but individual states are no longer important enough to warrant being considered the center of power. Indeed, following the influence of Michel Foucault, power is dispersed through an infinite number of sites with no real center and, following Karl Marx, states really aren<sq>t that important to understanding history and politics since it is Capital that makes the world go round. My problem with this thesis is that it really doesn<sq>t leave anything else to say. You either accept it or you don<sq>t. As a social scientist, I can claim every phenomenon I observe is the outcome of <dq>Empire<dq>, or I can try to find a more specific explanation. I prefer the second option. <br><br>The antithesis of the Hardt and Negri model has been advanced by John Kelly and Martha Kaplan and we can call this the World of Nation-States Model. Kelly and Kaplan take the USA<sq>s claims to support freedom, democracy, and national sovereignty seriously, arguing that the US has worked hard for decolonization after World War I. That said, what we end up getting is not absolute freedom for the oppressed, but rather a model of state power called the nation-state. Essentially, the US allows for only one form of national self-determination, the liberal nation state. While geographic areas that cannot, for whatever reason, provide their inhabitants with a sufficiently pervasive state structure become <dq>failed states<dq><colon> fields for the continual intervention of NGO<sq>s, Counter-Insurgency operations, and global capitalism. And even when nation-states are successful, they often involve the oppression of minorities and political violence to achieve this end. Kelly and Kaplan argue that the US is not an empire, but that it has achieved its global power through a novel and new model of an international community of nation-states that play by America<sq>s rules or face the consequences. <br><br>As for my own thesis? I<sq>m still working on it. I would only say that its hard to study Iraq and not see things that look a lot like historical imperialism, once we accept that historical imperialism was a ridiculously messy endeavor that fed on corruption and failure (see *Building the Devil<sq>s Empire<colon> French Colonial New Orleans* by Shanon Dawdy). I also think that empire really works through a collection of persistent myths and symbols that encourage people to go off to far-flung locals and that, in fact, most of the myths and symbols of American occupations come not from European colonial efforts, but rather from our own <dq>cowboys and Indians<dq> history of settler colonialism. <br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>The United States of America is not an empire in terms of its own political self-management, i.e. the inner affairs, or its own political composition. It is however something which many nowadays scholars consider to be an <dq>Empire<dq> in terms of its foreign policy management and behavioral patterns as showed toward various states (mainly) across the past century. When personas the Western media like to call <dq>dictators<dq> such as Fidel Castro, or Hugo Chavez, and lot of other political figures mostly from Latin America (this is not an accident a lot of them comes from this region when you are familiar with the history and the US foreign policy toward Latin America) calls the US political figures <dq>imperialists<dq> it is not a simple remnant of the Cold War, when the west was often referred in open speeches to as a capitalist empire or a capitalist paradise with imperial tendencies. They refer to the US like this because of the often neo-colonial approach United States took toward its <dq>backyard<dq> neighbours when the US government <dq>smelled<dq> something they did not like, for instance, a social revolution which would heavily influence the profit-making elements of its society, like corporations. Hence, there you have lot of US supported covert or direct operations like in Guatemala 1954, Cuba since 1959, more specifically, since vice-president Nixon, upon his personal meeting with Fidel referred Castro to Eisenhower as a pure communist who must be approached carefully and eventually dealt with, resulting to various anti-Castro operations, like the Playa de Giron (Bay of Pigs) invasion, partially the October (Cuban) missile crisis, then, for instance, Dominican Republic 1965, Bolivian action sponsored heavily by CIA which resulted in Guevara<sq>s death, Death of President Allende of Chile in 1973, and so on. This is of course not a thing only in Latin America, for the United States also sponsored or took part in various other coup d<sq>etats around the globe, for instance the one in Iran in 1950s when they helped the British to topple down the former government, installing a dictatorship. Latin America, in my view however suffered the most from the US neo-colonial/imperial behavioral patterns, because of its proximity and a relative easy way of dealing with issues there. The US practically tried to control the region, calling it its <dq>backyard<dq>, focusing on the prevention of intrusion of a single socialist - or something what they referred as communist elements. The only time you can say they really failed was with Cuba. Castro therefore had to face the wrath of a giant only by himself for couple of decades, his only real ally for a short time being already mentioned President Allende who eventually ended up being killed in La Moneda Presidential palace on 11 September 1973, when he fought the military coup. There were of course other small scale revolutions around Latin America, like in Nicaragua during the 1960s decade, but most of them were seriously crushed down by the US organised and sponsored coups, the ultimate point of which was to put a figurehead dependant on the US, assuring that the corporate profits will flow, something Castro put stop to in Cuba, through Che Guevara designed (co-designed) Agrarian, and other reforms, which nationalised US <dq>owned<dq> lands in Cuba, redistributing them to the people.<br><br>There might be many opinions on this and I really do not want to argue with anyone, so feel free to correct me, share your own opinions, etc.<br><br> **TL;DR<colon> The US is an Empire in terms of the execution of its foreign policy, mostly in Latin America in latter half of the 20th century.

Driven by convictions of Manifest Destiny after the War of 1812, American whites continued to expand their influence and physical power across the western bounds of this country. Eric T.L. Love points out that this is not really considered <dq>imperial<dq> because the Indian Nations were not viewed as sovereign states. Love argues that this is merely continued colonization and not pure imperialism. With the S-A-C-F War we see a transformation binding Manifest Destiny to Monroe Doctrine. This is effectively the first time that the United States had stood up outside their traditional sphere of influence to impact physical control of another region (the Barbary Pirates do not apply here as the aims of that conflict was merely  the protection of our existing physical property). Many historians such as Walter Lafeber, Eric Love, Michael Hunt, and Samuel Flagg Bemis argue that the U.S. is an empire (and I certainly agree with them), the true argument is what drives U.S. imperialism. Lafeber would have you believe that expansion of land, markets, and unilateral ability are our key aims. Love and Hunt would argue it is white-Anglo ethnocentrism. Bemis would state that through our expansion we are spreading liberty and democracy (a la the War on Terror?). There is a great amount of historical posturing on the question <dq>what drives American imperialism.<dq> my only suggestion is that if this seriously interests you then you should investigate as much of this work as possible so you may have your own informed opinion.</p>",

The folks in r/AskHistorians could probably do a better job than us at explaining the roots of racism in the South. As I understand it, the Southern agrarian economy was dependent on slave labor to a far greater degree than the industrialized north. This would mean that many white Southerners clung to the notion that black folks were sub-human property and passed these ideas on to their children, so that these ideas persisted in the American South well after the official end of slavery. <br><br>Also, just because there are more black folks in a place doesn<sq>t mean that they<sq>ll actually have contact w/ white folks. [Fivethirtyeight](http<colon>//fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/) used some data from Brown University<sq>s [American Communities Project](https<colon>//s4.ad.brown.edu/Projects/Diversity/index.htm) to determine which cities in the U.S. were the most integrated (i.e., had blacks and whites living in such close proximity that they would be reasonably expected to actually interact). I haven<sq>t had time to really dig into the data, but for a relevant example, you could look at the table on 538 and see that Boston, Massachusetts has a much higher integration index than Birmingham, Alabama. So, it seems that physical segregation of blacks and whites is something that occurs all over the U.S., but is probably greater in the South than it is in the Northeast and West (the Midwest is more of a mixed bag in this regard, it seems). <br><br>Finally, there<sq>s the matter of defining and measuring <dq>racism.<dq> [Kinder and Sears](http<colon>//psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/40/3/414/) posit two types of racism - symbolic racism (abstract, moralistic resentment) and realistic group conflict theory (fears based on tangible threats).

So, I suspect that both the North and the South have their racism, but that it is a different type, and possibly different magnitudes. </p>",

Since the 1960s there has been a shift away from positivism in the social sciences towards a normative and critical orientation. What this means is that instead of trying to develop a social physics that create generalizable a predictable laws of social interaction and societies, researchers are more interested in understanding how different social systems, customs, or practices have developed and their impact on how people live their lives. So, instead of trying to create a formula to predict the likelihood of someone who grows up in poverty staying impoverished, researchers might try to understand how the educational systems that have developed around that person have affected their ability to develop in demand skills. <br><br>This trend has been driven by some of the biggest thinkers in the 20th century. I<sq>m thinking primarily of the Frankfurt School of sociology and Michel Foucault. They both had very different perspectives, but both argued that it was the duty of the intellectual to analyze society, identify its faults, and try to fix them rather than simply creating models that describe the world. This called for a very activist social science who<sq>s job it was to point out problems in society and to research how they<sq>ve come about and what can be done to combat them. These ideas really took hold during the 1970s and 1980s when governments around the world were trying to reduce the role of the state in everyday life, especially around providing welfare and other support to the poor. <br><br>That being said, there are still lots of social scientists who use positivist models<colon> economists and quantitative sociologists come to mind.

The Soviets created a model in which communist parties formed governments with other leftist parties, and these <dq>people<sq>s democracies<dq> would be on a gradual path to communism (but not as far on it as the USSR) rather than emulating an abrupt Russian-style revolution. Slowly the Soviet Union would marginalize other coalition partners so that communists would control the state, but these other leftist parties often continued to exist, even if only in name. In this way, the USSR could maintain the guise of democracy, co-opt other (sometimes more popular) leftist parties, and rationalize further involvement in these states. Many other communist movements emulated this more inclusive, less revolutionary form of communism, either with direct or indirect Soviet influence.<br><br>Of course, these states rarely lived up to liberal democratic standards of democracy, but it was a euphemistic way to keep Marxist revolutionary ideas without any of the baggage of communist rhetoric. One exception would be the Dem. Rep. of Congo under anti-communist Mobutu Sese Seko, though it was possibly to highlight Mobutu<sq>s populist message.<br><br>Sources<colon>  <br>Ruth Amende Rosa<sq>s <dq>The Soviet Theory of <sq>People<sq>s Democracy<sq><dq> in *World Politics*  <br>Robert Services<sq> *A History of Modern Russia* and *Comrades!

Each company was required to build only 50 miles (80 km) in the first year; after that, only 50 miles (80 km) more were required each year. Each railroad received $16,000 per mile ($9,940/km) built over an easy grade, $32,000 per mile ($19,880/km) in the high plains, and $48,000 per mile ($29,830/km) in the mountains. This payment was in the form of government bonds that the companies could resell. To allow the railroads to raise additional money, Congress provided additional assistance to the railroad companies in the form of land grants of federal lands. They were granted right-of-ways of 400 feet (100 m) plus 10 square miles (26 km2) of land (ten sections) adjacent to the track for every mile of track built. <br><br>To avoid a railroad monopoly on good land, the land was not given away in a continuous swath but in a <dq>checkerboard<dq> pattern, leaving federal land in between that could be purchased from the government. The land grant railroads, receiving millions of acres of public land, sold bonds based on the value of the lands, and sold the land to settlers, using the proceeds to build their railroads, and contributing to a rapid settlement of the West.<br><br>The areas that were owned by the federal government were more heavily regulated and buyers were given more lenient pay schedules, where as the <sq>other side of the tracks<sq> which was owned by the rail company was often a slum, badly developed areas that were poorly regulated (think sub-prime mortgages) and strict, often unfair payment schedules. <br><br>Hence, over the course of nearly a hundred years, the areas originally owned by the railways became the homes of the working poor, and the areas originally owned by the federal government eventually became gentrified and prosperous. Eventually, the phrase <dq>from the wrong side of the tracks<dq> worked its way into the vernacular until no one remembered why it was that way. <br><br>[link to the wiki article about transcontinental railways that gives more detail](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Transcontinental_Railroad) </p>",

It wasn<sq>t until the 80<sq>s (or so) that the media started getting a bit more...invasive...into people<sq>s lives.

An exceptionally potent case of this is the wave of daycare sexual abuse cases in the 80s<colon> https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria<br><br>Finally, various studies/reports around child abuse had surfaced since even  the 1930s. Slowly yet surely evidence started to aggregate into the narrative that, hey, maybe child abuse can occur anywhere (even in the middle class, who were likely the largest consumers of media because they could afford the technology to tune in), and maybe instead of blaming the victims we should help them. These studies/reports eventually gave way to the proliferation of abuse programs and centers that aimed to help women and children. The creation of these centers helped to solidify the notion that abuse wasn<sq>t just a private matter anymore, but that sometimes outside and/or professional intervention was needed.<br><br>And because child abuse became more known and less private, people had to externalize the possibility that their own family friends or relatives would abuse their children, which helped perpetuate the stranger danger myth.

The first was the break up of the Whigs in the 1850<sq>s that led to the Republicans and the Democrats and very quickly the Civil War. The other was the segragationist Southern Democrats repeatedly splitting off from the Democrats over issues of civil rights for blacks (she mentioned 1948 but it happened or nearly happened a few times after that as well).

For more on party stances, I have a longer post [here](https<colon>//np.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/4ngh1h/democrats_will_learn_all_the_wrong_lessons_from/d44a4si/) about how recent intraparty competition has moved both the Democrats and the Republicans around in terms of their positions (mainly focused on domestic policy). But it should be enough to give you a clear sense that there have always been jockeying factions in the party, and sometimes those factions are very unhappy.

[Here](http<colon>//www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/the_democratic_party_establishment_is_finished_after_trump.html) is a pull-no-punches election post-mortem that highlights some serious issues for the party. There are many disenchanted people on the left who were wildly supportive of Sanders and lament the fact that the party was unwilling to move further left when the popular support for him was made clear. Does this mean a party split? That depends - if the party is willing to adjust in the face of defeat by adopting more explicitly progressive policies than probably not. But if the party establishment remains stuck in its ways, that disenchantment from the left could take the shape of starting an all new party to meet their wants. </p>",

Basically, the author<sq>s argument is an elaboration on Marx<sq>s theory of [Commodity Fetish](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism) and, to a lesser degree, [False Consciousness](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consciousness). <br><br>Anne Mcclintock (the author of Imperial Leather) makes the claim that when one social/political group dominates another, certain predictable relationships will emerge. She labels these <dq>Splitting<dq> and <dq>Doubling<dq>. Splitting is dividing the marginalized group geographically, economically, or in some other externally expressed manner. So, for example - have you ever been in a situation in which you could only afford housing on one side of town, but could only find employment on the other side of town?

You<sq>ll note the same thing whenever you see a hard-right wing politician or priest who has made a career of marginalizing gay men gets <sq>outed<sq> as a gay man himself.

The basic premise is that the prototypical Black person is a man. That is to say, when asked to picture a Black person, most people think of a man, not a woman. Some suggest that this is accounted for by the fact that stereotypes of African Americans feature many stereotypical masculine traits (e.g. aggression, physical strength.)

                "answer": "<p>Well, you can refer to the already rich field of political philosophy that already deals with monarchy. Nietzsche, Burke, Rousseau, Hobbes, Aquinas, Locke, Plato, and Aristotle are some of the more notable and influential writers on it in Western philosophy (Kongfuzi, Menzi, Hanfei, Xunzi, and Zhuxi are highly influential in Chinese statecraft if you want to pick up a translation) but the corpus on monarchy and its development is quite vast. My suggestion is to read up on some of the literature and take in their views on politics and political development as a whole, and is good holistically. <br><br>But if you don<sq>t want to read *Leviathan*, *The Social Contract*, etc. to lay the groundwork and the abstract<colon> it highly depends on the society. The development of monarchy is highly dependent on the region in question, and how the system derives its legitimacy. Some monarchies formed their legitimacy from religion; the Caliphates, for instance, or the Egyptian dynasties. We also have noble-democratic succession of rulership, such as in the Anglo-Saxon Witenagamont. Then there<sq>s the good ol<sq> right of conquest, and the use of force; the Mongols became rulers of large realms because their leaders were strong and charismatic, and they conquered the lands that they ruled. And then there<sq>s the meritocratic argument of Plato or Kongfuzi, etc. So essentially; if you wanted to make yourself a <dq>king<dq>, it would depend on the place you wished to be <dq>king<dq> of. Becoming King of France during the High Middle Ages is an entirely different affair from then from being Emperor of China, then from being an Iroquois Chief. Where, therefore, can we find commonality in their development?<br><br>What you<sq>re asking is essentially<colon> what makes governments, not just monarchy, legitimate? Indeed, why do we even need governments in the first place? And that is a complex question.<br><br>To that, I<sq>d refer, broadly speaking, to the development of private property and the concept of ownership, but more importantly, to the nature of human relations and a social contract (of which an abstraction exists in even property-less societies).<br><br>There must be a reason for people to give up their <dq>natural<dq> rights in a state of nature to form a society out of anarchy. Why should we give up doing what we want whenever we want?<br><br>Well first, <dq>natural<dq> liberty is not always desirable. A person in nature is not free and guaranteed life or private property; indeed, a person in nature is constantly threatened their life or private property from other individuals who can, through force, freely take your life or private property. As Hobbes argues, this natural state of anarchy is one of the war of all against all (*bellum omnium contra omnes*). Thus, we delve into the development of the first social contract; the development of societies, clans, etc, whose purpose is to provide security, stability, and a guarantee of liberty from such violence. Moreover, it allows for cooperation between individuals. As Plato in the Republic notes, the specialization of persons and the development of economies based around such positive-sum interactions. This is evident in hunter-gatherer societies, and not just in sedentary ones; within a group, there are those who hunt, those who take care of the children, those who forage, etc, as it ensures better skills and a higher chance of survival for the group itself.<br><br>Additionally, society also develops since humans are naturally social animals, as a result of our biology/method of procreation and the family unit it produces. From the parent-child relationship, we begin to produce a larger and larger clan, from which basic societies form around. <br><br>Thus, society thus develops through mutual cooperation and positive sum trade, through common security, stability, and the guarantee of civil liberties by trading away natural rights, as well as through the development of clannish/familial groups.<br><br>And, with the specialization of individuals, and the development of society, who leads and governs the people? And here we get into the concept of political legitimacy, consent of the governed, and the role of the governors and the governed. Ultimately, you rule because the society you rule (or important segments of society) believe your rule is legitimate, for whatever the myriad reasons. Perhaps you are seen as an able leader, or perceived to derive your power from the supernatural. Perhaps you are charismatic, and people follow you. Perhaps you base yourself on established traditions, on clan ties, and the existing social structure. Perhaps you rely upon the rule of law and complex legal structures or societal rituals/obligations. Perhaps you are powerful, and you coerce or persuade people into following you (but then, where does your power come from?).<br><br>However, you<sq>re asking why people will end up protecting, and follow a leader; the first leader/king. Again, it ultimately comes down to the people themselves agreeing to make you king, and to rule. That you have legitimacy in your rule over them as part of a social contract. That rule by you is preferable to a looser confederate structure, rule by a council of elders, or any other form of government.<br><br>Well, Weber has categorized authority into a [tripartite](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_classification_of_authority) (an elegant, if oversimplified categorization, in my opinion)<colon> charismatic, traditional, and rational-legal authority. In the case you<sq>re talking about (being the first king/ruler), you would be drawing either on your own charisma abilities, qualities, strength, and insight etc., whatever it may be, to inspire loyalty in your followers and those who would proclaim you king, or upon traditional networks<colon> through your family and clan, through patrimonialism, and filial piety, etc. <br><br>While there are those such as Hobbes who argue that legitimacy can also be derived from the right of conquest, I disagree. Well, in the modern sense, this is not the case, but also in the abstract. Say that you are indeed powerful and are able to conquer the area; the question becomes, who are your followers and why do they follow you anyways? And, as the concept is <dq>might makes right<dq>, the conquered and enslaved obviously have a right to rise up and overthrow the rulers if and when they are strong enough. Thus, conquest does not create legitimacy.<br><br><br>**Well, that was a monster of a post. In summary, it comes from a social contract between you and the people who follow you<colon> that they give you their consent to be ruled, and make your rule legitimate. Also, read some of the philosophers who<sq>ve discussed this. Rousseau<sq>s Social Contract, Locke<sq>s Second Treatise of Government Hobbes<sq> Leviathan, Plato<sq>s The Republic, and Aristotle<sq>s Politics are all good starting points from western discourse.**<br><br>**EDIT<colon> in eastern discourse, Confucianism similarly develops around such basis. The whole basis of Confucianism is filial piety and tradition, as well as the obligations of the Emperor/lord to the people, the people to the lord, the father to the son (and vice-versa), etc, and the mandate of heaven as a concept is in many ways a social contract between heaven, the Emperor, and the people.**</p>",

This forces people to cooperate either to fend off invaders or to attack (or reciprocate attacks in border skirmishes). We see this kind of behaviour in chimpanzees so we can postulate that it may go back fairly deeply in our evolutionary past. In his framework there needs to be a population <sq>parochial altrusts<sq> that are belligerent and want to fight in order for cohesive group formation to take place. <br><br>Now in any kind of military conflict information dissipation is a really big problem. The groups that tend to win in conflict tend to be the ones with branching hierarchal structures that can dissipate and receive information quickly. You can think of information in this sense as an analog to thermodynamic power; what matters is the ability to do work in a given unit of time. The group that can maximize power, in the sense of organizational effectiveness and/or physical numbers and strength, will likely be the one to win a conflict. It also helps to have a final decision maker that can make quick decisions if there is a lack of consensus. An example of this is the rigid structure of the Mongol horde into a [decimal system](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_military_tactics_and_organization). Each unit had a microstructure of organization and a connection to a macrostructure that could move information rapidly. <br><br>So now let<sq>s be a little bit looser and imagine a situation where you are the head of this hierarchal military system and you want something, perhaps land, perhaps power, perhaps you disagree with the most charismatic civilian in your clan or social organization.

                "answer": "<p>I am going to be as neutral as possible and try to make it simple to read at the same time. The Palestinian/Isreal/Islam issue are fraught with bias so I apologise for being a bit vague. The reading list is a starter point - no a definitive list. <br><br><br>There are three major difference<colon> a) ideology b) origins and c) vision.<br><br>*Fatah*<br><br>Fatah is a faction of the PLO - the Palestinian Liberation Organistion. The PLO was an umbrella group that was formed, much in the same way as the ANC though differing in vision, to fight for a Palestinian homeland. <br><br>PLO , and Fatah, are a secular and nationalist organisation. Their focus and vision is the liberation of what they see as the Palestinian homeland from occupation, and forming a nation-state. The PLO were a group with many factions that came together to form this  - regardless of religion. They were informed by the liberation struggles in Africa and South Asia, they were heavily influenced by elements of the progressive left in the west - though some were very communist and tied in to the USSR (thus laying themselves open to be taken hostage by the cold war proxy wars). <br><br>Fatah became the most powerful faction within the PLO , under the leadership of Yasser Arafat. Arafat styled himself as a revolutionary commander in the form of Che Guevara and Jamal Abdel Nasser, leading a Pan-Arabist movement to , as he saw it , free the Palestinians and the Arabs from colonialism. He worked hard using soft and hard tactics to cement his position as the pre-eminent leader of the Palestinian cause as well as Fatah<sq>s position as the dominant player in the PLO. <br><br>I<sq>m going to skip a lot of the history, but suffice to say by the late 1980s PLO was pretty much Fatah, and when the Olso Talks began , they were the only game in town that when it came to delivering a Palestinian partner in negotiations with the Israelis. When the Oslo accord were signed the Fatah<sq>s dominance was complete as it cemented itself into a legitimate government that was internationally recognised. <br><br>This obviously relied on Fatah delivering the goods when it came to Palestinian rights, and as it was forced into more compromises, members of the separate from the PLO ( now the PLA) and outlier groups such as Hamas became more prominent. <br><br>With the death of Arafat , Fatah, lost a lot of power and charisma. While he was in charge the Palestinian population were willing to put up with obvious corruption and mishandling as long as some sort of unifying deal/ father figure was around. With Arafat gone, the big man left the room and Fatah was left to find an identity for itself - which so far it has not been able to do. This opened the door to Hamas which offered a purer and more direct political message to the Palestinians who had seen Fatah fail to deliver for over a decade. <br><br>*Hamas*<br><br>Hamas are a strange creature in many ways. It is alleged that they were encouraged in their formation by elements of Israeli security services in order to keep Arafat and Fatah on their toes. If so, in a classic case of losing control of your own creation, Hamas soon became an organised and potent political force as well as a military threat. <br><br>The uncontroversial historical narrative of Hamas is that the appeared in the late 1980s when members of the Palestinian diaspora, influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood, decided to form an alternative to the PLO/Fatah.  Their ideological focus was Islamic and they believed this provided the legitimacy and narrative the struggle was lacking. Their military division took lessons from various fighters and insurgencies around the world, especially the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan and Hezbollah in terms of how to target IDF and Israel. <br><br>They also began to absorb the MB<sq>s (and Hezbollah) ethos of grass roots social work. they filled in vacuums left by both Fatah and the UN aid agencies in providing adequate care and social welfare to pockets of Palestinians around Gaza and the West Bank. They also provided education and employment. <br><br>After Oslo they capitalised on the corruption, lack of visible progress in making peace and the perceived betrayal by Fatah gave them more of a voice. They were able to use their significant social base to develop a political power base. The death of Arafat made them more powerful as the <dq>Oslo class<dq> of Fatah supporters seemed to be bent on consolidating their gains rather than supporting the peace process or the people. <br><br>Hamas has also had to change. It has gone from the upstart radical group, to a governing power in Gaza with wider political responsibilities. Where, before, the military wing and the insurgents had the power in Hamas, now the political operators and strategist have become more prominent - especially with Gaza as a place where they have to actively demonstrate their qualities of leadership. <br><br>*Hezbollah*<br><br>Hezbollah are very different in many way to Hamas and Fatah.<br><br>Firstly Hezbollah are a Shia Muslim organisation. The came to prominence in the 1980s due to the Israeli Grapes of Wrath operation, where they both were involved fighting the IDF and fighting the PLO militias based in refugee camps in Lebanon. <br><br>During the civil war in Lebanon, they were one of the many factions involved in that murky conflict of cross and double cross, with factions/warlords/militias fighting, changing sides and co-operating in different ways almost daily. <br><br>They weren<sq>t the only Shia group either, with Amal and Islamic Jihad being two Shia factions that fought with and against each other to various degrees. They also tangled with the US. The  US Marines and Hezbollah engaging with each other - leading to the famous Beirut bombing. <br><br>Hezbollah, because of its religious foundation, and connection to the clerical class in Lebanon, attracted Iranian interested and help. Though Hezbollah like to say they were primary an indigenous organisation, and there is a lot to backup their claim, without Iranian training, weapons and cash it is doubtful they would be as powerful as they are now. <br><br>Increasingly as they began to come to prominence, they came into conflict with the IDF and were consider a serious threat to the IDF. Other forces in the region noticed. Especially Hamas.<br><br>Though ideologically separated by the sunni/shia split, Hamas did copy a lot of Hezbollah<sq>s methods and structure. There is no evidence of direct training or links, but it<sq>s more that possible that conversations happened between commanders in Lebanon.

However, there is interesting historical research that claims that violence rates have been on a long and steady decline (see Steven Pinkers <dq>better angels of our nature<dq>, 2011) following the course of modernized society. But serial killing has always been an anomalous behavior.  Serial style killing is a rare event and so being able to make decisive causal claims can be extremely difficult. Holmes and Holmes attempted to find a common thread among all people who commit serial killings (1998/2009) by creating a serial killer typology, but as interesting and enlightening as that would be it hasn<sq>t rigorously stood up to empirical testing (Canter & Wentick, 2004).

However, we can probably say a few things that might be constructive in how we look at these problems. Below I present two ways of thinking about the <dq>forever alone<dq> situation from the economics matching point of view.<br><br>First, many individuals might be in <dq>thin markets,<dq> which is a market with few buying or selling opportunities. So, for example, in the general population if I were to walk into a bar and start talking about my love of abstract mathematics. I would add myself to the supply of possible mates that women at the bar could <dq>buy<dq> if they find my looks and interests well aligned with their own. However, due to my peculiar disposition towards talking about mathematical theory, I might not be able to find many people who see me as a potential mate as a result. So my own preference and interests might make me select into markets that have few mating opportunities. <br><br>Dating websites like OkCupid, and even more specific ones like ChristianSingles or FarmersOnly are examples of programs that probably help people with niche beliefs that might have problems finding local matches find prospective mates [Freakanomics podcast about this](http<colon>//freakonomics.com/2014/02/21/online-dating-in-thin-markets/). Also, generally in <dq>thick<dq> markets, people have better chances of matching [source](http<colon>//www.nber.org/papers/w10815). A way of testing this hypothesis would be to poll people who consider themselves forever alone on political, social, and interest topics, and see how they compare to a random sample of the population in general.<br><br>Secondly, based on that, we may see selection biases. Introverts are not likely to go to bars in the first place, or be nervous to use available methods to find possible mates. Alternatively, my interests in abstract mathematics used above might place me into a demographic composition that is incredibly one sided to feature towards a partcular gender. These sort of problems make utilizing the <dq>thin markets,<dq> solution sometimes weird. <br><br>In the worst cases, where we have a group of people that are largely unlikely to find good matches in the general population, and there interest in extremely male-skewed, it may allow women in those markets to feature stronger <dq>buying power,<dq> in being able to pick the cream of the crop. The results may be that people due to a mix of their interests and preferences are unable to find a good match in the couples market. [role of sex ratio in positive assortive mating](http<colon>//web.stanford.edu/~ranabr/marriage.pdf), [How Sex Ratio<sq>s Affect Marriage and Labor Markets](http<colon>//economics.mit.edu/files/20)<br><br>The result of these two claims are as follows. Many who consider themselves forever alone, might find themselves in markets where they have problems finding mates, especially in markets where they have niche opinions, beliefs, or preferences, and where the opposite gender may have an asymmetric level of <dq>match market purchasing power.<dq> This may occur even though they are healthy, attractive, and an otherwise desirable match.</p>",

The Republic of Ireland, for instance, is much more religious than Wales or England.  The Czech Republic is much less religious than Poland or Slovakia.  Finland is a bit more religious than the other ~~Scandinavian~~ Nordic countries.<br><br>As I put in detail in the American/Europe post above, there are about four things that we know really matter for explaining between country variation in religiosity<colon> religious competition, level of <dq>human security<dq> (roughly <dq>development<dq>), closeness to regime, importance to national identity.  I<sq>ll bracket the part about different ways to measure religiosity (self identity, participation in religious rituals, participation in religious communities, importance of religious values, etc.).  They<sq>re generally pretty correlated with each other, especially in Europe.  Countries where religious self identity is particularly important tend to over report religious participation, as measured by time use studies, etc.  Let<sq>s assume we<sq>re roughly trying to explain [this map](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File<colon>Europe_belief_in_god.svg), which is about belief in God.<br><br>Anyway, to our cases.  In Europe in general, there<sq>s relatively little religious competition.  In places like England, Germany, and Switzerland, you have had some Protestant and Catholic competition, but to my knowledge, you have had relatively little <dq>switching<dq>, like you see people switching between Methodism, Baptism, Presbyterianism, in the United States.  So differences in competition plays a relatively small role in Europe, especially since the literature indicates that, for switching and for increases in religiosity, there must be two religions not just in the same country or region, but in the same *town*.<br><br><dq>Human security<dq> probably plays a role, as you<sq>ll notice that there<sq>s a consistent association between the poor countries.  But human security, as argued by Norris and Inglehart, is more than that, more than just development.  It<sq>s about risk, particularly perceptions of risk.  You<sq>ll notice that the <dq>PIIGS<dq> countries [Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain], the EU countries whose economies worry investors and central bankers the most, are generally more religious.  PIIGS are Southern Europe, but Eastern Europe has also experienced tremendous economic uncertainty, you know with the whole transition from a planned to a market economy only twenty five years ago.<br><br>Closeness to regime, we<sq>ll sort of skip over, as it only really matters for countries that had revolutions.  But you<sq>ll notice that Catholic former Communist countries, except the Czechs, are all pretty religious.  Many people argue that the Catholic church was particularly good at opposing communism, so as people were all like, <dq>Boo communism<dq>, they were all like, <dq>Yay Catholic church<dq>.  Protestant and Orthodox churches, which are generally nationally run rather than run from abroad/Rome, had more trouble resisting being coopted by Communist states.   People also account for the France<sq>s early lead in irreligion by the closeness of the Church to *Ancien regime*, and how the French revolution really gave a kick in the pants to French secularism.  In Romanian, the churches played an important role in kicking off the Revolution that executed Ceau\u0219escu, but I honestly forget the details (religion in Romania, especially because of the large Hungarian minority, is a relatively complex issue).<br><br>One of the most important factors, and the one that<sq>s also the hardest to measure and model, is how religion relates to national identity.  Look at the Czech/Slovak/Poland answer above.  To be Polish or Slovak, in large part means to be Catholic while to you don<sq>t have to be anything to be Czech (Genevieve Zubrzycki has written about Poland, Paul Froese about the Czechs and the Slovaks).  To be Turkish means to be Muslim, even if you never go to mosque (Jenny White has written about this, and how this is may be changing).  To be Irish long meant to be Catholic, though people argue that<sq>s changing (the best example of a change is Quebec, where during the Quiet Revolution, Quebecois identity moved from being about religion and language to being almost exclusively about language.  This has allowed a rapid decline in religiosity in the subsequent fifty years).  In general in contemporary Europe, religion is more important to national identity in Catholic countries than Protestant countries.  Arguably, in countries like France, Denmark, and the Netherlands, it is not a particularly religion that is important to national identity, but secularity/cosmopolitanism, hence you<sq>ll see this identity influencing people away from religiously self identifying.<br><br>There are two other issues that are less well studied, but I think are also important.  One is how it has been possible to be secular/irreligious in a country.  France and England, counting the deists, obviously have particularly long histories.  Eastern Europe and Southern Europe have had shorter and less illustrious histories.  The second is religious parties.  I haven<sq>t seen any analysis done in Europe, but there is an interesting argument that the rise of the Moral Majority/religious right in America caused a lot of political liberals to have decreased interest in religion\u2010\u2010sort of a <dq>if that<sq>s what religion is, then I<sq>m not religious<dq> effect.  I<sq>d argue that there<sq>s also the reverse effect, where political identity reinforces religious identity, and people who might have disaffiliated don<sq>t.  You don<sq>t see sociologists making many predictions, but I think the rise of the AKP in Turkey and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt will decrease religiosity among their political opponents. Hence, in Europe, where we<sq>ve long seen religious parties, especially in the form of Christian Democracy in Catholic countries, we<sq>d expect that this politics would keep some people affiliated with religion and encourage others to disaffiliate, based on their political identities.</p>",

Here<sq>s a brief overview of some of the literature on why there may be issues in these glorious transitions. For the mods, since this is ELI5 I<sq>ll mostly be linking to wikipedia where relevant, rather than more formal treatment of the particular theorems, etc.<br><br>I mainly answer, what is Wrong With Communism.<br><br>First off, there is a lot of work that<sq>s been done in social choice theory that broadly shows voting mechanisms favored by the anarchist crowd don<sq>t lead to ideal outcomes for everyone, or might not be able to act on the actual preferences of the community given voting design.<br><br>One of the oldest, easiest to convey, and powerful results is [Arrow<sq>s Impossibility Theorem](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow<percent>27s_impossibility_theorem), which effectively states assuming people have different orderings of preferences, it is often impossible to create a policy plan that leads everyone to be better off that isn<sq>t non-dictatorial.<br><br>Market processes in this light offer alternatives through people finding no-democratic forms of showing and obtaining preferences, that seem not to be able to be met by traditional voting mechanisms. This is also conveyed even earlier through the [Condorcet<sq>s paradox](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_paradox) which shows Arrow<sq>s theorem strictly through the lens of voting mechanisms leading to transitive preferences. I.e. democratic voting mechanisms can lead to no <dq>best option<dq> over a group of people. A hypothesis I would push is that may be a cause of gridlock, or non-performance of political groups.<br><br>Secondly, there is significant work done in what is referred to as <dq>public choice,<dq> as for why (indirectly) vanguard party systems lead to corruption, and or dictatorial rule.<br><br>These authors assert that if we assume that politicians and individuals within political systems act under the same rules as we assume consumers and firms act under we can no longer assume that government is a <dq>benevolent dictator.<dq> Individual maximizatoin can lead to power centralization, usually seen in the term of <dq>rent seeking.<dq> [Wiki Article](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice_theory), [Econ Lib Overview](http<colon>//www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PublicChoice.html)- the later of which is probably a bit biased but might give a better overview.<br><br>These two lines of research point to two plausible conclusions. Pure democratic based society for social and economic decisions may not lead to the best outcomes for more people than capitalist systems do (to address the anarcho-communists, sydicalists, etc). Secondly, that vanguard parties should in any means be actively distrusted as a means of bringing about the workers revolution, as once they have control of the reins, it is doubtful that they will actively release it. The historical experience of communist regimes supports the second quite handily.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I\u2019m going to focus on the question <dq>What is wrong with communism?<dq> Since, as others have mentioned, there isn<sq>t a single agreed-upon definition for communism, I<sq>m going to break this down into three questions that can be fairly easily answered.<br><br>**1. Why aren<sq>t most decisions about economic production made by a centralized agency?** (i.e., what<sq>s wrong with Soviet communism?)<br><br>A serious problem with having the state decide which goods to produce, and how many of those goods to produce, is that a centralized state is limited in its ability to acquire information about consumers<sq> desires. It<sq>s simply extremely hard to guess at how many of something which people are going to want at any particular time. It<sq>s also difficult for a centralized agency to adapt to unexpected circumstances. For example, say that this year, there\u2019s a bumper crop of wheat. Who do we give it to? Doctors? Garbage collectors? Do we use it for bread? Cakes? Cookies? And how does the extra wheat affect our demand for goods that might be substitutes for wheat\u2014do we need as much barley and spelt as we had planned for?<br><br>In a market-based economic system, these decisions are determined by individual consumers and producers in a highly decentralized way. And the way we avoid having too much or too little of something is through the *price system*. It is prices that provide consumers and producers with all the information they need to make choices about their consumption of goods.<br><br>This insight about the informational role of prices was most famously made by F. A. Hayek in [*The Use of Knowledge in Society*](http<colon>//www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html).<br><br>**2. Why don<sq>t we let workers own all corporations?** (i.e., what<sq>s wrong with market socialism?)<br><br>In a standard private corporation, the owners are the shareholders. As the owners, the shareholders whom to hire to manage the corporation. But some corporations are run as co-operatives\u2014some dairy companies are owned by the producers, for example, and most law firms are owned by partners in the firm. Why aren<sq>t all corporations run this way?<br><br>An important fact about most well-working co-operatives, as Henry Hansmann observed in [*The Ownership of Enterprise*](http<colon>//www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674001718), is that the owners are all *providing a similar sort of input* to the company. This makes it relatively easy to make decisions about how to divide the corporation<sq>s profits. If all the owners are providing milk, they can be remunerated according to how much milk they provide, for example.<br><br>In most ordinary (i.e. shareholder-owned) corporations, however, the workers are providing *very different kinds of input* to the firm. If these firms were owned by the workers, it would be very difficult for the owners to come to agreements about how to divide the firm\u2019s profits. How is the contribution of a sales associate to be weighed against that of a cashier? The contribution of someone who develops a company<sq>s new drug against the contribution of the person who markets it? Having the workers make all these organizational and distributional decisions is incredibly costly, and that<sq>s why most corporations are privately owned, despite that co-operatives, in most jurisdictions, receive preferential tax treatment.<br><br>**3. Why don<sq>t we let the government run all corporations?** (i.e., what<sq>s wrong with bureaucracy?)<br><br>[**Edit<colon>** I have added what follows. I had to end my original comment here due to time constraints.] If a corporation is put under political control, then either the person who manages it is elected, or the person who appoints the manager is elected. What can be controlled politically is the leadership of the corporation. Importantly, as Charles Lindblom observed in [*Politics and Markets*](http<colon>//books.google.ca/books/about/Politics_and_markets.html?id=PBa5AAAAIAAJ), what can *not* be controlled politically is the *output* of the corporation\u2014what it produces. In direct contrast to this, in market systems, consumers can <dq>vote<dq> for outputs by choosing to buy some products and not others, but do not get to choose who manages the companies that make these goods.<br><br>Because consumers vote on outputs and because corporations have the single goal of maximizing profits, corporations cannot persist in doing the opposite of what they<sq>re trying to do. But government-run organizations can. <br><br>The two problems that government-run organizations can run into are, first, that changes in leadership may not cause desired improvements in outputs\u2014voting someone out of office won<sq>t guarantee that her replacement will do any better, and replacing one appointee with another could be similarly futile\u2014and second, that managers of public corporations often lack the same sort of direction as the goal of profit maximization provides to private companies, which makes managers of public companies difficult to hold to account and gives them scope to behave in unpredictable ways.<br><br>For example, let<sq>s say that I<sq>m an owner of an auto manufacturer that\u2019s been nationalized. My performance is judged based not only on how profitable the corporation is, but also on how many workers I employ, how fuel-efficient my company<sq>s cars are, and how safe they are. Let<sq>s say that I employ lots of people and produce really fuel-efficient cars, but my company loses tons of money and makes cars that are really unsafe. <br><br>Is my performance so poor that I should be replaced? I<sq>ve performed badly on some metrics, but well on others. If someone takes issue with the poor safety of my company\u2019s cars, I can stress how well I\u2019ve done at employing workers, and I can make the case that there<sq>s no way for me to improve the company along some metrics without falling short on others. Without a single goal for me to accomplish, it<sq>s hard for people to doubt me. And because I don\u2019t have just one goal, I can choose which goals to put above others, and hence can do things that people might not expect.<br><br>This last point explains why it is in fact useful to society as a whole to make profit-maximization the goal of private corporations. Because private corporations have a single goal, their behaviour is *predictable*, and they<sq>ll respond in predictable ways to changes in incentives that governments can impose. So if you think a corporation needs to cut down on carbon emissions, for example, you can simply make it costly to emit carbon by taxing it. Since the corporation wants to maximize profits, it will emit less carbon or have to bear the cost of failing to do so. In contrast, making the corporation public and appointing someone to run it would make the behaviour of the corporation more difficult to control, and paradoxically more likely to do things against the interest of society.<br><br>I<sq>ve perhaps gone on too long about these points regarding the benefits of private corporations controlled by markets over public corporations under political control, but I hope I<sq>ve been clear. There are other differences between public and private corporations, but I think these are some of the most important.<br><br>====<br><br>I need to stress that all of what I<sq>ve written does *not* imply that central control, or worker ownership, or bureaucracy are always undesirable. These systems have failures, but markets have failures too. The viability of a market-based capitalist system versus one of these other systems depends on what the organizational form is being applied to and whether the failures of markets outweigh the failures of these other systems. It so happens that, for the production of common physical goods the quality of which is fairly quickly discernible (e.g. apples, screwdrivers, books), private corporations work pretty well. And for corporations where the workers produce similar inputs, worker ownership works pretty well. But in other environments, the institutions that are common in most rich countries today seem to work better to accomplish the institutions<sq> goals.</p>",

[Overall Homicide rates are here](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate).  And the second source<colon> [Overall <sq>firearm related deaths<sq> are here](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate).<br><br>If you go to the first source, then you can plainly see that America has by far the highest intentional homicide rate of all developed countries at 4.7 every year per 100,000.

Ford and Beach, in *Patterns of Sexual Behavior* (1951), presented findings of same-sex behaviors in numerous human cultures and animal species, and concluded that there is a basic mammalian capacity for same-sex behavior.  <br>Evelyn Hooker administered psychological tests to 30 self-identified homosexual men and compared the results with those of a matched group of 30 heterosexual men (the men were paired based on equivalent IQ, age, and education). In her paper *The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual* (1957), she presented findings that the homosexual men were comparable to their heterosexual peers in terms of mental adjustment. Experts who were asked to examine the unmarked psychological profiles could not differentiate the two groups based on mental health. This challenged the prevailing notion that homosexuality was in itself an inherent cause of mental illness.<br><br>Following Kinsey<sq>s and Hooker<sq>s studies, more research was directed to focus on nonclinical samples of homosexual men and women (i.e. ones with no background of mental illness). This, coupled with improved methods of assessing human personality (e.g. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire) and mental disorders (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory), proliferated inquiry into human sexuality. Research conducted with the new measures repeatedly produced results that indicated that homosexual men and women were essentially similar to their heterosexual peers in mental health.<br><br>A campaign to remove homosexuality as a mental disorder from the DSM was launched by gay rights activists (e.g. Frank Kameny and the Mattachine Society) in the early 1960s, which was strengthened by the Stonewall riots. Given the results of research, activism was directed at the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association.  <br>Following advocacy both outside of and within the American Psychiatric Association, the association began evaluating research and literature to assess the status and validity of homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 1973, the board of trustees and general members voted to remove homosexuality from the DSM and issued a statement supporting civil rights protection for gay people and calling for the repeal of sodomy laws, among other things.

                "answer": "<p>The state of the literature on this question is far from settled and part of this is due to the lack of number of cases in which a state granted a dictator immunity. My background is in large-n statistical research and I am pretty sure most of the scholarship in this area involves case study approaches to particular kinds of leadership exits. If you use scholar.google.com and search for dictator and immunity, most of the top hits discuss Noriega and the United States or Pinochet. <br><br>Quantitatively, we do know a few things. First, how you come into office tends to correlate heavily with how you leave office. The Archigos dataset captures all leader exits and entries from 1875-2004. From that, we know that if you came into office through normal means, you end up exiting through normal means about 93<percent> of the time. However, if you came into office through irregular means or you were installed by another state, then your likelihood of having a normal exit of office drops to around 19<percent> and 22<percent>. The percent of those cases that are exiled are 43<percent> and 54<percent>, imprisoned are 18<percent> and 22<percent>, and those in the sample that die make up 20<percent> and 1<percent> (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).<br><br>The dictator is a rational actor and if they see that there likelihood of losing power ends in extreme personal costs, they are more likely to take actions that are costly to the public. This includes the obvious such as more repression and human rights abuses, but also includes externalizing their problems in the hopes of surviving. There is a host of International Relations literature often referred to as <dq>Gambling for Resurrection<dq> which comes from diversionary war theory. The quick summary is that there are domestic advantages to going to war. Going to war can allow a leader to take more repressive measures as well as stifle dissent domestically (or gain more support via the <dq>Rally around the Flag<dq> effect were a government gains short term legitimacy as people support their country during a crisis). If a leader does well or even wins the war, then the challenge(s) to their legitimacy may dwindle. Diversionary war theory typically spoke to democratic leaders, but more literature now posits that at-risk autocrats and democratizing states are subject to diversionary forces (e.g. Goemans 2000; Chiozza and Goemans 2003; Chiozza and Goemans 2004; Mansfield and Snyder 2005). Ultimately, the literature on the subject is mixed and seems to find stronger support for mixed/transitioning regimes to be at the biggest risk for gambling for resurrection.<br><br>If you want to end the immediate threat of more costs from repression, aggressive actions by the state, and possible war, then immunity looks like a good idea. A leader may be looking at a best case scenario of exile with a worst case scenario of execution.  Democrats tend to go on speaking tours when they leave office, autocrats generally do not get such cushy lives when they leave. Given those options, they may be willing to try everything to maintain their grasp on power. Offering an autocrat the <dq>easy out<dq> over the <dq>just out<dq> may very well save more lives and bring closure to a brutal time in a country<sq>s history.<br><br>For further research, I suggest looking at Truth and Reconciliation Commissions in the Human Rights literature. They serve a similar purpose as immunity and part of the rational for offering  a non-prosecutory search for justice is to prevent reprisals, bloodshed, and further governmental instability by actions of the accused (via coup, revolution, etc.).<br><br>Additionally, Bueno de Mesquita<sq>s book *The Dictator<sq>s Handbook<colon> Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics* almost certainly addresses this question as well as many others. I have yet to read it, but it is sitting on my shelf at the moment waiting for me to go through. He is a well known game theorist/formal modeling and is likely discussing autocrats from their perspective.</p>",

This was not entirely Soviet paranoia<colon> Finland had tacitly allowed, for example, the Royal Navy torpedo boat units to use its territory to launch surprise attacks at naval base Kronstad in Leningrad and had permitted volunteers to fight in Russian Karelia in an ill-fated Aunus expedition (it attempted to foment an anti-Soviet rebellion in Russian Karelia and annex those lands into Finland). Furthermore, Finland was known to be relatively pro-German and definitely anti-Soviet.<br><br>The Winter War was precipitated by a demand from Soviet Union to Finland<colon> because of a threat of general war, cede control of key islands in the Gulf of Finland, a naval base, and move back the border opposing Leningrad. This would have restored the tsarist Russia<sq>s pre-1917 plans for defensive perimeter for St. Petersburg/Leningrad, in essence. Of course, the Soviets also looked forward to annexing Finland as a soviet republic, but those bases were also fairly important. Finnish politicians asserted that Finland would not allow its territory to be used by any third party, but the Soviets didn<sq>t believe that Finland could or even would prevent Germany from doing so. <br><br>So, this led to Finland fighting (depending on how you count) one to three wars against Soviet Union and later Germany. Even though Finland retained its independence and was not occupied - the only European country fighting the Soviets that survived - the wars caused great damage and resulted to the loss of Karelia, the region bordering Leningrad, as well as those islands in the Gulf of Finland, and a <dq>lease<dq> of a military/naval base in Porkkala, at the southernmost tip of Finland (and conveniently within artillery range from Helsinki). <br><br>Besides, Finland was forced to sign a treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance (FCMA) with the Soviets. This treaty stipulated that 1) Finland would remain neutral and not allow anyone to use its territory against the Soviet Union, and 2) in the event of war with <dq>Germany or any of its allies,<dq> Finland would defend its neutrality and if necessary <dq>ask<dq> for Red Army to <dq>help<dq> to defend Finland<sq>s territorial integrity. The Finnish negotiators managed to modify the original text so that mutual consultations were needed before the Red Army could proceed, but in effect Finland was in a position where it would, come general war, fall into the Warsaw Pact as a silent member. (Not that there were any other kinds in the WP.) I believe not one Finn had any illusions what would happen if the Red Army troops were to be permitted into the country<colon> they wouldn<sq>t leave and the political system would inevitably follow. And aside from a small cadre of hardcore Communists (even the majority in the Communist Party wanted to retain Finland<sq>s independence), this was the end of the world scenario for the Finns.<br><br>So, Finland<sq>s foreign policy priorities #1, #2 and #3 in the Cold War were <dq>not permitting anything to happen that could invoke the FCMA consultations.<dq> In practice, this meant that Finland had to stay out from anything that smelled too Western to the Soviets (including Marshall aid), as well as to develop its armed forces so that it could present a credible deterrent against anyone who attempted to use its territory against anyone else. Accordingly, there were two sets of war plans within the Finnish army for example<colon> the ones that were shown to most politicians, where Finland would fight against an unidentified <dq>yellow<dq> power coming from any direction but East; and the real ones under many locks and keys, where, well, I guess you get the drift. It was political tightrope act, to put it briefly.<br><br>The act was somewhat problematic because Finland was still between the Soviet and the Western blocs. The flight plans of U.S. strategic bombers, for example, would have taken them across Finnish airspace, and it is now known that Finland would have been where the Soviet air defence forces would have begun engaging Western bombers. There was, in fact, an aerial battle in 1954 where a reconnaissance bomber (RB-47) overflying military installations in the northern Kola peninsula was chased into Finnish airspace by Soviet interceptors and fired upon; although there were several reliable witnesses, the incident was hushed up in the Finnish press, because officially Finland was neutral and these things couldn<sq>t happen. <br><br>In the 1970s and early 1980s, Finnish fears about the FCMA pact led to some notable acts of self-censorship in Finland - the process is generally known as Finlandization. Finnish politicians and part of the press were afraid to say anything critical of the Soviet Union, on the pretext that it would <dq>endanger good relations.<dq> Since open criticism about the Soviet Union was very rare (and could spell trouble for one<sq>s career prospects), the criticism of the Western system and NATO might have appeared far stronger than it would have appeared in a more balanced discussion. This <dq>foreign policy card<dq> - in other words, using real or more often pretend Soviet interests as a bogeyman and/or blunt instrument with which to bludgeon opponents - was unfortunately also seized upon and used by opportunistic politicians as a tool to enhance their own careers, and the period remains something of an embarrassment in Finland. <br><br>Nevertheless, the end result is that Finland has a strong tradition of doubting NATO and military alliances in general. Besides the mentioned negative perceptions, there are also solid reasons for not joining<colon> unless officially-neutral Sweden joins at the same time, Finland - being accessible mainly through the Baltic Sea - is effectively isolated from NATO hinterlands and would be problematic to reinforce in time of crisis. The developments of NATO in the 1990s and 2000s have also caused many (myself included) to doubt whether the <dq>new NATO,<dq> geared as it has been for <dq>small wars<dq> instead of facing Russian mechanized divisions, would even be very capable of helping Finland even if it wanted to help. Finns still remember how the League of Nations let them down in 1939 and how the proposed British/French relief expedition of 1940 would in reality have been a cover for the seizure of Swedish iron ore fields, and many doubt how many Germans or Americans would want to die for Finland. A famous saying often quoted in Finnish discussions about alliances goes something like this<colon><br><br><dq>Future generations, stand here on your own soil without relying on outside help.<dq> (This is an engraving on the gate to 18th century island fortress Suomenlinna, <dq>the Gibraltar of the North<dq> just outside Helsinki; there is some irony in the fact that the engraving is in Swedish in a fortress that was built with French gold by the Swedes as a base against Russia.)  <br><br>Finally, there is a very real perception that Russia would take offense at Finland joining NATO. It<sq>s almost certain that it would damage the commercial interests of Finland, and foreign politics would become more difficult as well. In the worst case, some fear that joining NATO would be a *casus belli* for the Russians. In this climate, it is no wonder that NATO membership never seems to gain the majority support; although many knowledgeable observers of Finnish politics say (and I believe that to be true) that if the political leadership simply stated that Finland needs to join NATO, the majority opinion would change. <br><br>The way I and most knowledgeable people in Finland see it is that NATO would probably be fairly pleased to have Finland. We have a strong land army that is specifically designed, trained and equipped to fight the Russians, and NATO Finland would greatly strengthen the defense of the Baltic republics. But the realistic prognosis is that Finland will not join unless Sweden joins also; and it<sq>s possible that Finland doesn<sq>t join even if Sweden does.

One major reason is lack of religious extremism. People in the area tend to belong to mainstream religions like Catholicism and Lutheranism while Baptists and Born Again Christians are rare. Union membership is still quite high because there are a lot of blue collar manufacturing and shipping jobs.

                "answer": "<p>Great question. Lets break this down into a few areas so we can get you some good books/papers on the subject. What I am seeing in your question is partisanship, ideology, electoral realignments, and shifts in public opinion on issue dimensions. I will try to answer this to the best of my ability but hopefully someone more well read in American political development, or polarization comes by and helps out. <br><br>The first thing I would mention is that the political parties before the 1960<sq>s werent organized by ideology. They were essentially regional coalitions of various interests and each party had its liberal, moderate and conservative wing. Truman tried to recruit Eisenhower to run on the democratic ticket in 1948 but he turned them down. Hans Noel has a good book called *Political Ideologies and Political Parties in America* that describes how issue entrepreneurs(i.e. pundits, activists, other ideologues) changed the game.  <br><br>Post 60<sq>s the parties drift apart ideologically and racially. Conservative southern democrats switch over to the republican party. Black voters sign up to the democratic party. Poole and Rosenthal (1984) is a good place to start with any talk of polarization. Hutchings and Valentino (2004) is where you would want to look if you are interested in race. <br><br>If you care more about policy than public opinion or the platforms or parties/candidates. Then we can look at tax policy, welfare policy, crime policy and other issue dimensions where the Reagan administration made big changes that were either deepened or sustained by following administrations (Hacker, 2004; Hagan, 2010). <br><br>**EDIT<colon>** [Here](http<colon>//www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/LaymanCarseyReview2006.pdf) is a link to an Annual Review article that sums up the research on polarization. This should be helpful and save you some time. <br><br>**TL;DR** Party positions on civil rights legislation destroyed the ascendant New Deal coalition built by Roosevelt. The defeat of the liberal coalition allows conservative issue entrepreneurs to establish power in the Reagan administration and shift policy in a rightward direction.

Polling confirms that the share of undecided voters to be won over in elections is smaller and that the average Democrat/Republican is more liberal/conservative than he was 20 years ago.<br><br>There may be various ways to measure whether the US has shifted <dq>right<dq> or <dq>left<dq> (in this case I guess it would mean whether the country<sq>s attitudes and policies as a whole are more traditionally conservative or liberal, although a 1 dimensional political spectrum like is somewhat oversimplified. I am not aware of any studies or attempts to quantify how liberal/conservative the country is as a whole unfortunately. <br><br>In some ways one can argue that America is more culturally liberal. Homosexuality and gay marriage has become accepted by most of the population after only a decade or so, thanks in part to positive portrays of gay people in popular media. Americans have moved [leftward](http<colon>//www.gallup.com/poll/183413/americans-continue-shift-left-key-moral-issues.aspx) on a number of issues relating to sexuality and morality. Americans have moved rightward on [gun control](http<colon>//www.cnn.com/2015/06/19/politics/gun-ownership-declines-support-for-less-gun-control-on-the-rise/) and the story is [mixed on abortion](http<colon>//www.gallup.com/poll/183434/americans-choose-pro-choice-first-time-seven-years.aspx) - for the first time in 7 years, most Americans label themselves pro-choice, yet a majority believe abortion should be legal in a few or no cases. <br><br>So there is a combination of rightward and leftward swings on individual issues and public opinion, but if you look at the structure of the US government, it has definitely shifted rightward, especially since Obama became president, ironically. Democrats took control of Congress after 2006 and in 2008 they won the White House and Congressional supermajorities. Pundits were writing about how Obama<sq>s coalition would set up the Democrats for decades of political dominance. After 2 midterm and 1 presidential election since then however, Republicans have come to hold more seats in Congress, more governorships, and more state legislature seats than they have [since the 1920s.](http<colon>//www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/12/09/in-the-states-the-gop-is-in-its-best-position-since-the-great-depression/) Even though they could not win the presidency in 2012, Democrats look even more vulnerable in 2016. Not only that, but 5/9 Supreme Court justices now sitting were appointed by Republicans, and a Republican president could increase that if a Democratic appointee dies or resigns in the next 4-8 years. <br><br>So basically, if the GOP wins in 2016, Republicans will control every branch of government at every single level, which hasn<sq>t happened for them in decades. This could be considered a rightward turn for the US politically. </p>",

Laura Agust\u00edn makes a passionate case against these stereotypes, arguing that the label <dq>trafficked<dq> does not accurately describe migrants` lives and that the <dq>rescue industry<dq> disempowers them. Based on extensive research among migrants who sell sex and social helpers, Sex at the Margins provides a radically different analysis. Frequently, says Agust\u00edn, migrants make rational choices to travel and work in the sex industry. Although they are treated like a marginalized group they form part of the dynamic global economy. Both powerful and controversial, this book is essential reading for all those who want to understand the increasingly important relationship between sex markets, migration and the desire for social justice.</p>",

The expansion in supply can spur an expansion of demand, and the same thing happens for demand as happened for supply<colon> not only can we measure demand easier, but more people may demand prostitution services when they are legal.<br><br>The increase in working prostitutes results in a scaling effect of the number of women/prostitutes trafficked into the country. However, this is somewhat offset by the fact that domestic prostitutes can legally work with relative ease and higher quality compared to imported/trafficked prostitutes.<br><br>Economically speaking, the supply of prostitutes experiences a scaling effect (the market grows) and a substitution effect (people change their preferences in favour of legal, domestic prostitutes). This means that theoretically the total effect is ambiguous and depends on which of the two effects is greater. From what I can find, it<sq>s generally agreed that the scaling effect is larger than the substitution effect, hence trafficking increases when prostitution is legalized. [This paper](http<colon>//link.springer.com/article/10.1007<percent>2Fs10657-011-9232-0) finds results similar to the one you posted, and looks at case examples of Sweden and Norway, which not only have prostitution as illegal, but make it criminal to buy a prostitute, with both laws being strictly enforced. The result is next to zero prostitution in either country, and very low/zero rates of trafficking.</p>",

Neither party can be too extreme for fear of alienating the polity (see the Republican party in the US right now). Two party systems do tend to discourage ideological alternatives though, which may be what you<sq>re asking. <br><br>I still stand by no because the two party system has nothing to do with the willingness of people to listen. In the US, in particular, we have a culture that prefers the <dq>us vs them<dq> mentality which is entirely apart from our political system.<br><br>J.D. Hunter<sq>s book <dq>Culture Wars<dq> outlines this pretty well. Essentially, Hunter notes that the radical divide between us and them wasn<sq>t really prevalent in domestic American discourse (excluding race and class obviously) and developed in the 70s/80s (coming to the broader society in the 80s but having existed among the elite much earlier). Putnam and Campbell, in their book *American Grace*, point to the sexual liberation movement of the 60s as the source of this polarizing backlash. Though their book focuses largely on religion, it<sq>s impossible to separate religion from American politics. Religion is at the center of our discourse (not necessarily our policies) and, subsequently, plays a large role in shaping that discourse. As Americans became more polarized religiously, political discourse shifted to incorporate these polarized positions. <br><br>Fast forward a few decades and you have one party that has adopted the religious orthodox position and another that has adopted the progressive (religious and secular) position. <br><br>So, back to your question - no, the two party system does not seem to have an impact on the them vs. us mindset, but the sharp polarization of American ideology/religion has been incorporated into that system. The consequence of radical ideology dominating political discourse is that any challenge to your politics (someone else<sq>s ideas) can be seen as a challenge for your religion/ideology, prompting a sharp rejection of them outright. </p>",

The four accepted models in [this article from 2000](https<colon>//www.researchgate.net/profile/Cynthia_Franklin2/publication/12680545_Preventing_Adolescent_Pregnancy_A_Review_of_Programs_and_Practices/links/00b4952a21e29cc5f5000000.pdf) (old but still stands, from what I can see) are<colon><br><br>1. Risk Reduction - Avoiding sexual intercourse/using contraception. (social learning and cognitive-behavioral model)<br><br>2. Postponing Sexual Involvement - Avoiding sexual intercourse by increasing knowledge and skill (social influence model)<br><br>3. Cognitive-Behavioral Prevention - Improve decision making skills regarding sexual intercourse and contraception (cognitive-behavioral)<br><br>4. AIDS Prevention Model - Spread knowledge about AIDS and skills to prevent unwanted pregnancies (health belief model, social cognitive, social influence theory)<br><br>This article also states that Social Learning models and skills/knowledge growth makes for a more successful program (again, we<sq>re talking sex EDUCATION, not sex abstinence. There is little to no education involved in sex abstinence programs, and that doesn<sq>t work for older children).<br><br>Younger children/teens will be more influenced by abstinence approaches, but older teens benefit more from contraception education.<br><br>So if we<sq>re deciding where comprehensive sex ed WITH parenting classes fits in, I think it fits into that risk reduction model. But it also fits in the AIDS prevention model, oddly maybe, because of the health belief model. <br><br>[Core Assumptions and Statements of Health Belief Model<colon>](https<colon>//www.utwente.nl/cw/theorieenoverzicht/Theory<percent>20Clusters/Health<percent>20Communication/Health_Belief_Model/) <br>The HBM is based on the understanding that a person will take a health-related action (i.e., use condoms) if that person<colon><br>1. feels that a negative health condition (i.e., HIV) can be avoided,<br>2. has a positive expectation that by taking a recommended action, he/she will avoid a negative health condition (i.e., using condoms will be effective at preventing HIV), and<br>3. believes that he/she can successfully take a recommended health action (i.e., he/she can use condoms comfortably and with confidence).<br><br>While pregnancy isn<sq>t necessarily a negative health condition, it certainly is for different individuals at certain times (women when they do not want children!). And pregnancy can lead to parenting, which isn<sq>t a health condition, but it certainly has an impact on our wellness and lifestyle. <br><br>When we talk about sex education as a health-related curriculum and as a part of wellness and health, we start to see how this model works. A person feels that pregnancy can be avoided (which we know it can), that by taking an action, you will avoid a negative health condition (pregnancy), and that you can actually use contraception confidently, then we should see an uptick in contraception use. But to do this, we have to educate on the health issue, which isn<sq>t just pregnancy, but also parenting.<br>-------<br>Okay, so backtrack a bit, why do teens NOT have sex? [According to a survey among teens from 2006-2010<colon>](http<colon>//www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_031.pdf)<br><br>- Top 2 responses for boys re<colon> why they have not had sex yest - because of religious/moral reasons or haven<sq>t met the right person.<br>- Top 2 responses for girls re<colon> why they have not had sex yest - because of religious/moral reasons or *don<sq>t want to get pregnant*.<br>- For top reason for not having sex<colon> Only 13<percent> of boys stated they didn<sq>t have sex because they didn<sq>t want to get a girl pregnant, vs.  18<percent> of girls not wanting to get pregnant. This isn<sq>t a huge difference, but worth noting. (there<sq>s also a cool table, table 16, on feelings re<colon> getting pregnant/getting someone pregnant).<br><br>But this doesn<sq>t really tell us why getting pregnant is bad. Is it because they would be shamed? Couldn<sq>t get an abortion? Parenting is hard?<br><br>And why do teens get pregnant?<br><br>[Key risk factors include living in poverty, limited maternal educational achievement, and having a mother who gave birth before the age of 20. Additional risk factors include being from a single-parent home, living in a home with frequent family conflict, early sexual activity, early use of alcohol and drugs, and low self-esteem. Lastly, a teen\u2019s race and ethnicity can be a risk factor for teen pregnancy.](http<colon>//youth.gov/youth-topics/teen-pregnancy-prevention/risk-and-protective-factors#sthash.JuKhecxc.dpuf).<br><br>[We also know that many of these factors are risk factors for child abuse and mistreatment, absentee parents, and poor parenting.](http<colon>//www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/riskprotectivefactors.html) <br><br>So we start to see the venn diagram of pregnant teens/parenting teens and teens who come from abusive, poor, and/or neglectful households overlap more. This isn<sq>t to say that there is no way for a child from a chaotic home to avoid teen pregnancy, or for a child from a <sq>perfect<sq> home to become pregnant. But the risk factors are incredibly similar. However, motivating boys or children who cannot become pregnant for whatever reason can be difficult. This also leaves out LGBTQ children who may not be in relationships/plan on being in relationships or sexual encounters where pregnancy is a possibility. <br><br>So these pregnant teens may not have the best role models of healthy parenting at home. This can put them at risk of mimicking the behavior, having poor coping mechanisms, and have a lack of social support and resources. So, here, we can see how parenting classes could help teens who are pregnant OR may become pregnant learn these skills, and also recognize how maybe what they experienced at home isn<sq>t the norm or isn<sq>t safe at all.<br><br>-------------------------<br>TL;DR AKA WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?<br><br>Basically, there<sq>s a research gap from what I can see, that doesn<sq>t address whether parenting classes can reduce pregnancy or have a positive impact on society (when we start classes with nonpregnant youth). <br><br>However, parenting classes would fit well into a social learning model, health beliefs model, and would likely be a great part of sex education if we base it on what we already know about sex ed (the more knowledge and skill building, the better. The less fiction and fear mongering, the better).<br><br>As far as preventing pregnancy, I can<sq>t say for sure, but again, because of the comprehensive sex education models built on social learning and health beliefs models, it would likely be a good inclusion. Additionally, parenting classes for children and teens who are or could become pregnant at a young age would be a great idea since they may not have the social support and positive modeling at home required to be a good parent. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

Because the incidence of divorce is increasing in many countries, determinants of divorce rates assume great importance as indirect risk factors for several diseases and conditions that adversely affect health. We have undertaken a study in Athens, Greece, to evaluate whether sibship size, birth order, and the gender composition of spousal sibships are related to the probability of divorce. 358 high school students, aged between 15 and 17 years, satisfactorily completed anonymous questionnaires, indicating whether their natural parents have been separated or divorced, their parents<sq> educational achievement, birth order and sibship size by gender. The study was analyzed as a twin case-control investigation, treating those divorced or separated as cases and those who were not divorced or separated as controls. A man who grew up as an only child was almost three times as likely to divorce compared to a man with siblings, and this association was highly significant (p approximately 0.004). There was no such evidence with respect to women. After controlling for sibship size, earlier born men--but not women--appeared to be at higher risk for divorce compared to those later born. There was no evidence that the gender structure of the sibship substantially affects the risk for divorce. Even though divorce is not an organic disease, it indirectly affects health as well as the social well-being. The findings of this study need to be replicated, but, if confirmed, they could contribute to our understanding of the roots of some instances of marital dysfunction.</p>",

Typically speaking, terrorists have a certain <dq>threshold of violence<dq>. They seek to kill to gain attention, but have to balance this with the difficult task of not drawing the ire of those they<sq>re killing on them.

It explains the calculated levels of brutality that many terrorist organizations typically show.<br><br>When you talk to experts about ISIS, as the RAND Corporation did, they frequently express some level of surprise at its operation and style.

For recruits like these, issues of theology are virtually meaningless.<br><br>What has become increasingly clear is that ISIS is unique in that it doesn<sq>t *care* about this threshold of brutality. Many analysts today are arguing that it isn<sq>t so much looking for recruits on the basis of appealing to the general population, but rather by appealing to the millenarian (apocalyptic) prophecies some believe in. They argue that it<sq>s essentially <dq>strip-mining<dq> its territory, fueling a war machine that can only be kept running by expansion (similar, actually, to what some say the Nazis were doing with their military expansion). Some of this debate is alluded to in this recent Politico Magazine piece [criticizing President Obama<sq>s strategy against ISIS](http<colon>//www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/barack-obama-still-misunderestimates-isil-118204.html).

There are numerous people who have documented actions by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, for example, that demonstrate how atypical this is.

By all accounts, the militants did not realize that the compound housed mainly Arabs; in their statements, the QAP [Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] insisted that the government media were lying about the casualties being Arabs and Muslim. Muhayya was widely considered a turning point in the campaign because it shifted public opinion firmly against the militants.<br><br>That is the perfect example of how there are typically restraints on terrorist actions. They want attention, a lightning rod, but it has to be the *right one*. For ISIS to go around killing in a way inconsistent with most of the Muslim world<sq>s interpretation of Islam (and which ignores the entirety of how Muslim law changes over time), killing Muslims themselves in such brazen fashion, is a risky thing. Some believe it will ultimately lead to their downfall, as the war machine can only sustain itself for so long, and they will fade into a regular guerrilla group over time. How long is uncertain<colon> estimates that used to say about three years now suggest three years is the minimum of how long defeating it will take, with current strategy remaining constant.<br><br>ISIS is not necessarily appealing to the <dq>true path<dq>, therefore. They are also appealing to the brutality of some people, and calling them from all over the world to join them. They are appealing to the ignorance of others, who believe that they are finally seeing a true interpretation of Islam that they had been misled about for so long, and which they too must follow. And finally, they<sq>re appealing to the millenarian, to the prophetic who believe the end of days is coming and will be heralded by those who join ISIS.<br><br>Hopefully that helps. Stephen Maurer<sq>s *WMD Terrorism* talks about the evolution of terrorism in the first chapter or two, and then moves into how WMDs could or couldn<sq>t be used against the United States, what must be done to stop them, etc., and what difficulties mean WMDs are less likely to be used. There are plenty of histories of terrorism you can look at as well, so let me know if you want to look at them. While some authors talk about the Taliban being brutal (like Walter Laqueur in *The New Terrorism*), it is clear these authors are probably amazed by ISIS today by comparison.</p>",

If the need to dominate was the primary motivation, we would expect a high number of more vulnerable women falling victim to rape (such as the elderly), but instead we see a high number of women being raped during their physical prime in their years of peak sexual attractiveness.

Even though the Lib Dems might be in government, they<sq>re a really minor party (given their share of the vote), and have only about 50 MPs out of 640-odd. <br><br>Anyway, first-past-the-post does not ensure that there are two parties - it just tends to exaggerate the consequences of winning in terms of share of the vote [1] (although note that it doesn<sq>t *have* to do this, and there have been times in the UK when the party that got the most votes lost - 1951 and 1974, off the top of my head). It does this by giving a seat in the legislature to whoever gets the most votes in each district, with all the votes for losing candidates being disregarded. This also tends to act against minor parties - a vast number of minor parties could have similar positions, but they split each others votes, which allows a more mass-appeal party with less competition to take the win. Now, one consequence of this is actually that minor parties that have geographically based support find it *easier* to get elected. They only need to keep the support of a given area. This is why Sinn Fein, DUP, UUP, etc. all find it (relatively) easy to hold on to their seats - communities are organised on religious/political lines, and so the parties each end up preaching to the choir (not 100<percent>, obviously, but enough to be politically important). Similarly, this is why the Greens were able to get a seat in Brighton and Hove (UK), they had strong local concentrated support. The very fractured nature of UK politics, then, partly explains why there are so many different parties in the UK. Scotland is politically very different from England, Wales is different again, and Northern Ireland is quite appart from almost any other modern democratic political system - save for maybe Belgium.<br><br>One of the consequences of such a system, though, is that people often vote for parties that represent their interests less well than are available. So someone might vote for Labour, even though they really wanted to support the greens; since the Greens won<sq>t get elected in their area, and Labour is the second best option. Where you have more diverse geo-political units, you have to do this less - but it happens a lot anyway in majoritarian systems. So America is also likely to get more tactical voting too. Actually, people decide who they will vote for based upon their <sq>propensity to vote<sq> for parties (a decent freely available introduction is here [2], but you can stop at the methods, unless you<sq>re really interested). So people don<sq>t just have one preferred party, but many. So tactical voting makes even more sense here.<br><br>Finally, American parties are *really* broad churches compared to those in the UK. In the UK we have strong party control by the leadership, so the parties tend to be pretty coherent - in America it<sq>s more like the wild west. People can (almost freely) vote against their party line in the US, in the UK you<sq>ll be fired for doing so (if you<sq>re a member of the government or opposition), or may be prevented from becoming a member. So as a Republican candidate, say, you<sq>re more likely to be able to tailor your appeal to the local electorate, in a way in which it<sq>s not easy to do in the UK (where the leader basically can speak for you, and the whole party campaigns under a single fixed manifesto).<br><br>This is an inadequate run through, but it gives you some ideas.<br><br><br>[1] http<colon>//www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Choosing<percent>20Electoral<percent>20Systems.pdf <br><br>[2] http<colon>//www.piredeu.eu/Database/APSA_DOCS/Making_a_stacked_data_file_APSA_short_course_2010.pdf</p>",

I am also not British, but we have discussed the British case in class. Here are several reasons I think that are related to the <dq>why<dq> of your question. (edit) See these arguments in a broader context on the debate and not UK-specific (/edit)<colon>  <br>1. ~~There has always been a 2.5-party system.~~ The United Kingdom, and most European countries, have several political cleavages that simply can<sq>t be put in two parties. A multiparty system made coalitions possible in one issue but not in the other. The European evolution from (absolute) monarchy to democracy is something that the United States didn<sq>t have to deal with.   <br>2. The European construction has created some new political cleavages that were not fully captured by the traditional parties.  <br>3. The cold war<colon> McCarthyism and anti-communism has created a general fear with the American people for anything that smells like socialism. Europe has had a lot of succesful and failed revolutions (1848!) that created a strong labour movement that was not incorporated by liberal nor conservative parties.  <br>4. The United States is still the most powerful country in the world, so there<sq>s no discussion that its president is the most powerful politician in the world. The amounts that the two big parties and their powerful industrial supporters spend on campaigns to get into that powerful position is so unreal that no other party can compete.  <br>5. The US has a tradition of grassroots movements which makes single-issue parties superfluous as these movements campaign with individual candidates and politicians to support their cause.  <br>6. Edit<colon> A strong argument proposed by [DrNowt](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/user/DrNowt) in this same thread is indeed that American parties are very broadly defined with a lot of room for the individual candidate while European party systems grant a lot of power to the leadership of the party and their narrowly defined programs. You will lose party support if you don<sq>t vote in line with the party. A lot of (tiny) parties are founded because of dissatisfaction with its larger sister-party. A good example are the many socialist, leninist, maoist, stalinist, trotskist, new-left, communist parties. The same goes for conservative parties.<br>  <br>I am open for discussion.</p>",

This will raise under $50 billion in 10 years.

Now, lowering my tax will put $20k more in my pocket a year, but I still only sell $1 million in goods so I don<sq>t need any more people.  Maybe I go and buy a new machine with that money, or maybe I just stick it away in the bank to help next time sales dip even lower.<br><br>Cut the size of the federal government.  Money spent on the federal government is money not being spent in the private sector.  **Why it will fail<colon>** ~~Since we are not talking about new tax cuts, only keeping the existing ones in place, cutting the spending of the federal government will just remove money from the economy.~~    Romney<sq>s website only has about $2.6 billion in cuts (not counting the $95 billion for <dq>Obamacare<dq>) and then another $222 billion in cost saving by being more <dq>efficient and effective<dq>.  He will cut 10<percent> of the federal workforce.  That is over 200,000 jobs lost.  He will also cut their pay by 30-40<percent>.  That is $50 billion a year removed from the economy.  Plus, it should be pointed out that almost all of the increase in government employees during Obama come from Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security (places Republicans traditionally protect).   **How democrats argue it<colon>**  Romney will cut services for the poor.  **Why democrats are wrong<colon>**  Well, they are not really, after all, if defense cuts are off the table, there is not much left to cut.  However, Obama realizes there is waste in the federal government and has tried eliminated programs.  Also, other than Family Planning, Romney has not specifically targeted programs for the poor (and that has nothing to do with poor, but abortion).<br><br>Reducing regulations on businesses will cause the economy to increase.  **Why it will fail<colon>**  It all really depends on what regulations are removed/changed.  There are bad regulations out there that actually hurt jobs, but there are also many good regulations that help the country, environment, and overall economy.  Returning banking regulations to pre-2008 is probably a bad idea.  Removing environmental regulations from oil companies is probably a bad idea.  But the devil is in the details.   **How democrats argue it<colon>** They want to destroy the environment and put everyone in the poor house.  **Why democrats are wrong<colon>**  Hyperbole.<br><br>I think I have hit all of the major components of their plans, but I am sure I missed something.<br><br>**Edit<colon>** I made a mistake on Romney<sq>s tax plan. </p>",

That is to say, if poverty is understood as a problem, and that problem arises from some condition within society, this implicates public policy in any potential interventions; it rejects the commonsense belief that poverty is the result of individual-level failings and instead points to some way our society is constructed to create poverty in the first place. In our current political climate, the implicated policy interventions of this kind of thinking *tend* toward left-leaning ideas. <br><br>We could also easily cite the critiques of capitalism that arose with the founding of sociology as a discipline. While those are probably best understood as critiques of modernity, and should be situated in their historical contexts, these are nonetheless critiques of a status quo that many conservatives wish to protect (capitalism or free market capitalism more specifically), and these critiques remain influential in sociology and the social sciences more broadly. <br><br>[This link](https<colon>//thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/01/20/why-are-academics-so-liberal/) provides a different perspective in terms of left-leaning folks <dq>opting into<dq> academics.

Early sociological thought supported whichever conclusion was the most convincing, be it right-wing or left-wing. For example<colon> Durkheim demonstrated that reduced social control is not always good for an individual, as leftists would suggest, and is capable of increasing social evils, such as suicide rates. Weber advocated for superiority of rational-legal bureaucracy, in which religion and belief in magic was removed in process of rationalization, what appears to go in opposition to leftist/liberal outlook to freedom of belief. Robert Michels went as far as to say that oligarchy is inevitable and pure democracy inevitably degenerates into it, as pragmatic need to maintain the stability of bureaucracy outweighs everything else. Tocqueville, in his detailed description of American democracy, claims that democracy does not result in the rule of the best, and is actually responsible for the contempt for the elites in the US, but merely guarantees that the country will not be ruled by the worst.  Even Frederick Engels, the world<sq>s second biggest leftist, advocated that establishment of socialist mode of production would be impossible without establishment of dictatorship prior to it. <br><br>The one person I know who criticizes this recent convergence to leftism is Jonathan Haidt, the founder of Heterodox Academy.

The metrics (for one) are iffy (people are measuring exports against GDP; also, they are using a comparative scale to make a claim about absolute economic size-- that is, in 1909 huge pieces of the world were either colonies of Europe or not tracking economic data, making Argentina<sq>s position in the initial ranking less impressive), but the larger point stands<colon> At the beginning of the 20th century Argentina was a country poised poised to become the <dq>next US<dq> (first subway system of the southern hemisphere, one of the largest cities in Buenos Aires, the largest immigration wave, relative to initial population, it had something like 50<percent> of the industry in Latin America, and about 45<percent> of all foreign investment).  By the end of the twentieth century... not so much...<br>Although structural answers can sketch an answer, the historian in me favors a simple, contingent explanation<colon> Argentina was committed to a export-led growth model (like much of the non-European world in 1910) centered on beef and wheat.  When WWI closed the European markets, it sent the country into an economic collapse, highlighted by labor movements, anarchist conspiracies and severe repression of the <dq>social problem<dq>.  The post-war period had  modest recoveries, but a ravaged Europe was not purchasing these goods at previous rates.  The great Depression finally broke the system (with the infamous Roca-Runcimann trade pact between Britain and Argentina establishing a beef quota system in exchange for dramatic trade concessions).  By the end of the 30s Argentina had committed to an industrialization plan (part of the hemispheric ISI move-- Import Substitution Industrialization... See Prebisch<sq>s <dq>A New Economic Model for Latin America<dq>), which kept it neutral during WWII until the very end, to maximize exports to both sides while allowing the import of necessary industrial and capital goods, in an attempt to increase domestic consumption and redistribute wealth (which eventually happened under Peron in the mid 1940s).  In short, the wealth that was evident in 1909 was badly distributed, with large amounts of it being remitted back to investors in Britain (mainly) or divided by the agrarian elite.  The lack of investment in infrastructure or social plans by that governing elite meant that the lean years brought misery to the poor, disenfranchised majority of Argentines.  The issues with the military dictatorships in the 1960s, 70s and 80s sunk the country deeper, but the damage was done by the 1930s. <br>**in short<colon> Argentina was not as wealthy as it appeared in the early 1900s, just some of its citizens were**</p>",

To the Romans, there was manly sex and unmaly sex.    They didnt even have a word for <dq>homosexual.<dq>  The nature of men is to dominate by sticking their dicks in things.  Its only unmanly to receive a dominating dick.  I dont think the Romans as a whole had more or less 6<sq>s on the Kinsey scale than we did, but this specifically Roman social construct of manliness effected how open they could be and, presumably, how frequently they indulged in it.  Clearly, this is an example of culture influencing the different sexual behaviors between two cultures more than genetics.  <br><br><br>Here<sq>s another example<colon>  Things like nylon stockings, plaid skirts and pig tails, or spiked dog collars and leather tights mean something to us because culture invented that meaning, or the context from which the individual has created their own meaning.  There might be genetic factors, [which have yet to be identified,](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia#Causes) steering you towards grossly younger girls, but there are no genes written into people that make them turned on by plaid skirts and pigtails.  Culture just tells you those things represent young girls, which is why its more acceptable to play with the symbols than play with what they represent.  Specifically, like if you ask your girlfriend to dress up as a catholic school girl instead of having sex with an actual school girl.  Likewise, you might never develop a taste for anything beyond missionary if you were raised to think sex is a gross, dirty necessity you do to have kids.  You may have all the right genes to really enjoy oral, anal, swinging, or bdsm, but you<sq>re just never going to find out because social constructs have shaped your taste.  Again, these are examples of culture influencing the specifics of your sexuality in more specific and meaningful ways than just genes.<br><br><br>Specifically concerning these shitty <dq>pray the gay away<dq> camps, if you fall between a 1 and a 4 on the Kinsey scale, culture might sway you to act like a 0.  Those people probably wont need a pray away the gay camp if they can hide or ignore the gay parts of themselves a little easier than others.  This might be harder if you are a hard 6.  If straight sex is just not an option for you, a <dq>pray away the gay<dq> camp will fail, and probably fuck you up.  <br><br><br>Honestly, if you want to go knee deep into the nature versus nurture debate, you might want to go to r/askscience and ask about [behavioral genetics](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_genetics) . But it seems to me, through [this part of the wikipedia page,](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_genetics#Nature_of_genetic_influence) that we can identify genes that influence vague and general behavioral inclinations like shyness and risk taking in individuals, but have a hard time using that genetic data to predict the behaviors of large groups.  This might also be true of sexual orientation, but right now [no genes have been identified that make you gay independent of other biological or environmental reasons.](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation)<br><br><br>I think the important thing that a lot of people who reject <dq>social construct<dq> explanations forget is that human beings just have a wider range of possible behaviors than other animals.  Our genes dont have such a one-to-one causal relationship with our behavior like the genes of some other animals.  Its the variation in specific and complex behaviors that gives us adaptability.  It means we dont have to die and extinguish the gene that causes a certain behavior once it starts being maladaptive in our environment.  We can just change our behavior.  Culture, which is partly the commitment to a specific set of behaviors and ideas we make, or are conditioned to follow, has been one of the strongest ways we filter all that variation down and pass on adaptive behaviors to new generations.  The problem is that culture, especially when it values uncompromising faith and commitment over self reflection and incremental change, carries a lot of commitments to shitty ideas and behaviors that have a neutral effect on the survival of the group as a whole.  This is what I read as a big part of the narrative in E.O. Wilson<sq>s <dq>Social Conquest of the Earth,<dq> a recent favorite of mine.<br><br><br>Also, as u/komischaffe said, a lot of the failure of these horrible camps can be chalked up to kids being forced into them against their will without buying into the morals and values that make up the fundamentalist culture.

North America is just too big to have a strong consistent rivalry  against the city next door, but it does happen. For instance, one of the biggest rivalries in North American sports is the Buffalo Sabres vs the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey teams (often called the Battle of Lake Ontario or the QEW). Since Buffalo and Toronto are so close to each other (roughly two hours away), it<sq>s very easy for fights to break out before/after games and in the stands. On top of that, Toronto and Buffalo were both burnt down by the opposing country during the War of 1812. Each team<sq>s fans have earned a pretty bad reputation for going across the border en mass and taking over parking lots, restaurants, bars and sections of the arena when the two teams are playing a game in order to try and instigate a fight (especially when their team isn<sq>t doing well). There was even a reoccurring problem where Maple Leafs fans would throw their jerseys on to the ice in order to slow the game play once their team started to nose dive and lose. Buffalo fans are notorious as being hooligans that start fights both in the NHL and the NFL.<br><br>It even got to the point where the Buffalo Sabres raised the ticket prices on Maple Leafs games to try and stop their fans from gobbling up significant amount of the arena seats along with lower the risk of fights breaking out (Maple Leafs home games are also significantly more expensive than they are at the Sabres arena, leading to another reason for more fans to cross over the border, resulting in even more problems). <br><br> I am sure that there are other sports teams across the different leagues that face similar issues to this that I<sq>m not as familiar with. Europe is smaller and has more densely populated areas, possibly making it just easier for fans to follow their particular sports team and come into contact with their rivals. You don<sq>t see a lot of teams located geographically close to each other so it reduces the amount of chance for an incident to break out.

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m actually going to disagree with u/cinemabaroque on this one. At least as we define/understand marriage in Western societies, then no there were same-sex marriages before the 20th century.  In fact, there wasn<sq>t homosexuality as we understand it today - a more or less fixed identity rather than a set of behaviors.  [Barry Adam<sq>s <dq>Structural Foundations of the Gay World<dq>](http<colon>//www.jstor.org/stable/178596?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) or [John D<sq>Emilio<sq>s *Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities](http<colon>//books.google.com/books/about/Sexual_Politics_Sexual_Communities.html?id=Hk_6rbTiFvcC) explain this very well.  In a nutshell, before the industrialization of the 18th/19th century, opposite-sex marriage was structurally required.  People didn<sq>t have a choice to seek out romantic relationships - gay or straight - so while some could have homosexual sex here and there it could not be a defining feature of your life.  Industrialization allowed people to earn individual wages by working in factories, say, which gave a new level of individual autonomy.  They could then leave their tight-knit family and community structures and live on their own in the city, seeking out the people and relationships that they wanted.  <br><br>For a culture to recognize same-sex marriage, as we understand it today, they would first need the social structure that allowed for individual sexual choice - that is a precondition for people developing gay identities and establishing same-sex relationships. While non-Western cultures have recognized various forms of same-sex relationships, these were either temporary or within a different cultural understanding of gender as non-binary, as with Native American Two Spirits.  So, for instance, a biological female may have been able to take the role of a man, heading a household and owning property, thereby getting a wife too (as property), but this would not have been a lesbian relationship as we define it today. Similarly, a Two Spirit Native American may have lived in a cultural midway between male and female and had relationships, but these would not be same-sex marriages because they were not conducted under the rubric of a gender binary culture.  <br><br>That is, to have same-sex marriages as we define them today (two people of the same gender in a lifelong exclusive partnership) you first need to have a gender binary, a system under which two-way partnerships exist and are social recognized, and a social structure that allows individuals to enter into same-sex relationships.  These did not exist in cultures before the 20th century in the West.</p>",

Rape is not always about [sexual](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_sexual_violence#Power_rape) impulse.  Some (feminist) literature suggests that it is actually about power and [control over the victim](http<colon>//www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201104/is-rape-about-control-or-sex).  My personal opinion is that it is a mix of power/control and a small part sexual gratification. The amount of these two factoring into the situation vary due to the kind of rape (i.e. stranger, date, hate/humiliation).  Stranger and hate rape is going to be more about control and power.  Date rape will be more about wanting sex with a particular person.  For more reading on rape, I would suggest, Men Who Rape<colon> The Psychology of the Offender.<br><br>With that being said, I would speculate that rape would not significantly decrease because rape is still more about power and control over the victims, something that legalizing prostitution would not address.</p>",

You are being subjected to the will of another to such an extent that you do not have control even of your self. Often rape is committed purely for the purpose of demonstrating this (see Prison Rape wiki). This is often the reason when it happens in abusive relationships too.<br><br>Often rape victims do not tell anyone what has happened to them. Ever.

Some of the people who run the Arab Barometer are in the Arab World, often at the places you<sq>d expect (American University of Cairo, American University of Beirut). <br><br>There<sq>s also really excellent ethnographic work on Islam still being done today<colon> popular recent titles include Saba Mahmoud<sq>s *The Politics of Piety* (basically an argument with western feminists that many Salafi women are not subjegated and have agency), Charles Hirschkind<sq>s *Ethical Soundscapes* (about mostly Salafi preachers<sq> taped sermons), Amira Mittermaier<sq>s *Dreams that Matter* (about dream interpretation in contemporary Islam, and how it involves really diverse sources--most of this uses Sufi, rather than Salafi, informants so it<sq>s an interesting contrast with Hirschkind and Mahmoud). All three of those are based on field work done in Cairo. <br><br>Likewise, there is excellent historical work done on religion in the Ottoman period and earlier. Sufi orders and other ulema often leave written records (records intended as spiritual guides, but which historians use as a way to see what was important at the time) and provide one of the few non-state sources for many periods (though in Turkey, the ulema show up most forcefully as state kadi judges). I get the sense that intimate histories of Sufi orders in Egypt and other places are also being written. <br><br>So I get the sense you<sq>re talking about none of that. I get the sense you<sq>re thinking about histories of the Koran and very early Islam. You may not be, but that<sq>s my sense.<br><br>The secular study of the Bible as history was kicked off with [Wellhausen](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Wellhausen). He studied theology. He became a Protestent professor of Old Testament history. He was not really the first (you can see some info on the [Documentary Hypothesis](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis) Wikipedia page), but is often taken symbolically as the first. In reality, this debate starts more than a century earlier, with (anonymously published) treatises at first. This sort of secular [source criticism](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism_<percent>28biblical_studies<percent>29) (often also called <dq>higher criticism<dq>) was controversial at first, but it was mostly done by (mostly Protestant) theologians (plus a few agnostic gadflies here and there) genuinely interested in who wrote the Bible. <br><br>The Koran doesn<sq>t have the same sort of animating questions. Indeed, historians basically agree on its composition. There are a few outliers, like [Christoph Luxenburg](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Luxenberg), and secular historians will say Mohammad taught it rather than God spoke it though Mohammad, but there<sq>s not that much controversy about it. There some dating of specific Suras, not just Mecca and Medina but early and late within those periods (/u/shlin28 knows this better than I do, and I may as well ping /u/CptBuck as they<sq>re also more up to date on the recent scholarship).<br><br>One of the problems, though, is there aren<sq>t that many internal historical questions that need answering in the Koran. There are lots in the Bible, and early devout scholars with only internal evidence. To add history between the writing of the Quran and early Muslim historians, often requires using non-Muslim sources, which many on the theological side find inherently suspicious. This was the big revolution that Patricia Crone helped start (the best source book Hoyland<sq>s *Seeing Islam as Others Saw It*). There are several now very well respected histories that combine these foreign sources with Muslim sources; Hoyland<sq>s other very important book, *In God<sq>s Path* is one, Fred Donner<sq>s book, *Muhammad and the Believers*, is another. I don<sq>t quite know how their work is being taken in the Muslim world right now. <br><br>But as for Durkheim<sq>s (not Weber<sq>s) *Elementary Forms*, no, not really, as far as I know, this was written in the very secular French Third Republic (a decade or so after the [1905 law that strictly separated Church and State in France](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_French_law_on_the_Separation_of_the_Churches_and_the_State), the culmination of tension going back to 1789). <br><br>However, for example, with Frazer<sq>s the Golden Bough, written more than fifty years earlier in Victorian England, his inclusion of Christianity into his system had to wait until the Third Edition of 1905-1916 (first edition 1890). Even then, there was a popular single volume abridged edition that omitted all discussion of Christianity because it was so scandalous. Jonathan Z. Smith is the historian I know of Frazier, he<sq>s got a few articles here and there one with the clever title, <dq>When the *Bough* Breaks<dq>, though I can<sq>t remember if the scandalous mentions of Christianity were in that article or elsewhere. <br><br>Religious studies, though, has been an awkward mix and it took decades to sort out. In America, it wasn<sq>t really sorted out until a Supreme Court disallowed teaching *of* religion at public universities, while allowing teaching *about* religion. Critics argue that it *still* isn<sq>t sorted out, and that critical scholars are still a minority; [see here](https<colon>//bulletin.equinoxpub.com/2013/08/tilting-at-windmills/), for example (the title, <dq>tilting at windmills<dq>, is sort of archaic language, so I<sq>ll just make it clear it<sq>s a reference to Don Quixote), which argues that no matter how many great critical works are written, the mainstream of religious studies is secretly too religious. <br><br>A major driver of all humanities and social science research is, of course, state universities, and if state universities don<sq>t fund that kind of research in a country, it very often simply isn<sq>t done (it also leaves independent authors more open to attacks). <br><br>But one last point I<sq>ll leave you with (I<sq>m not sure I answered your question, but I<sq>ve talked a lot about it) is that in his very excellent book *A Secular Age* (hands down the most important book written on secularity and secularism in the past twenty years; arguably the most important about religion period, though I<sq>ll warn you it works very poorly in its details for the non-West), Charles Taylor argues that above all we need to remember that the secular is not a natural state, but rather specifically something *added*. That we should expect there to *naturally* be that division that you want, but that<sq>s a division that ultimately has to be created by people, well, like you. Taylor<sq>s book goes into how it happened in the West, but it<sq>s not exactly clear what lessons that has for the rest of the world. <br><br>On a very personal note, studying religious studies an undergraduate, I was also heavily encouraged to consider the rabbinate and very nearly went down that road, before ending up on the <dq>secular<dq> side of religious studies. <br><br>Edit<colon> it<sq>s old now (it<sq>s from 1985, the year I was born), but you might want to pick up Martin<sq>s edited volume *Approaches to Islam in Religious Studies*. There are a few chapters that might interest you. </p>",

In addition to this, policymakers want to stay in power so they distribute benefits to people within the state, either because the autocrat wants to buy off their silence, or the representative wants to buy off votes. Publics works programs, economic incentives, low to no taxes, etc. becomes understood as the standard operating procedures for the state. In other words, everyone expects for everyone to gain, and no one to lose. But they overextend and the economy collapses. The government can<sq>t just get rid of those public programs, that distribution of benefits from oil money, and at the same time it cannot tax to make up this money due to weak state structure and institutions. The state becomes reliant upon oil rents to pay off constituents and paying to recover from the collapse of rapid expansion. Actors within the state will then see opportunity to get involved in politics to gain a share of the petroleum rents, through interest group or political party formation, depending on regime type at this point. The state effectively becomes a large distribution scheme, where all actors are trying to maintain a positive sum game. No one rocks the boat so everyone can get a split of the oil rents. They become a petrol-state rather than a nation-state.<br><br>Pretty neat book. Worth a read if you<sq>d like to keep going into this subject.</p>",

If, at the time of joining, the political parties are strongly identified as pro- and anti- military - or even merely the population at the age at which people join strongly supports a party - we might expect that cohort to persist in support of one party over another. If recruitment then drops due to demoblisation, that cohort will become disproportionally large in the military.

Note that the trait model makes no comment on the directionality of the link. Suppose people from conservative backgrounds are encouraged to become soldiers - then it isn<sq>t that so much that soldiers inherently have traits that make them politically conservative as people with politically conservative parents self-select to be soldiers. Shapiro thought that self-selection might be important, as the majority of West Point cadets reported that their parents also identified as Republican.<br><br>And it is easy to think of other quasi-models<colon><br><br>* People are more likely to become soldiers if there is a base near their hometown. Military bases tend to be located in rural regions (or in the US, the Sunbelt) that tend to vote conservative. -> soldiers tend to vote conservative.<br><br>* Through chance, at one point the military was run by ideological conservatives. Subsequently recruits adopted conservative beliefs to identify with the in-group.

They divided America up into geographical and racial \u201cmarriage markets\u201d, to take account of the fact that most people marry someone of the same race who lives relatively close to them. Then, after crunching the census numbers, they found that a one percentage point increase in the male incarceration rate was associated with a 2.4-point reduction in the proportion of women who ever marry. Could it be, however, that mass incarceration is a symptom of increasing social dysfunction, and that it was this social dysfunction that caused marriage to wither? Probably not. For similar crimes, America imposes much harsher penalties than other rich countries. Mr Charles and Mr Luoh controlled for crime rates, as a proxy for social dysfunction, and found that it made no difference to their results. They concluded that \u201chigher male imprisonment has lowered the likelihood that women marry\u2026and caused a shift in the gains from marriage away from women and towards men.\u201d<br><br>Source<colon> http<colon>//www.economist.com/node/15867956</p>",

Food acceptance by a child is influenced by the example set by parents and familiar adults and peers. In addition the number of exposures to unfamiliar foods influences the child\u2019s likes and dislikes. The work of Birch and colleagues indicated that *dislike* for a food may be increased when a reward is given to eat the food.

With regard to the physical environment, children are more likely to eat foods that are available and easily accessible, and they tend to eat greater quantities when larger portions are provided. Additionally, characteristics of the social environment, including various socioeconomic and sociocultural factors such as parents\u2019 education, time constraints, and ethnicity influence the types of foods children eat. Mealtime structure is also an important factor related to children\u2019s eating patterns. Mealtime structure includes social and physical characteristics of mealtimes including whether families eat together, TV-viewing during meals, and the source of foods (e.g., restaurants, schools). Parents also play a direct role in children\u2019s eating patterns through their behaviors, attitudes, and feeding styles. </p>",

It<sq>s funny because I<sq>ve also studied mythology but mischief/trickster figures have never really been my interest.<br><br>As the title may indicate, Scheub<sq>s premise is that heroes and trickster  figures are at times one and the same - to become a hero, a mythological figure must play the part of a trickster, and a trickster may inadvertently become a hero. There is something in the narrative structure of such stories that demands a trickster character...<br><br>><dq>Trickster moves easily in the roles of god, man, animal, and insect, and there are times when his action is motivated, times when his action is unmotivated. But there is seldom any time when his actions lack meaning. And sometimes those actions are linked to cosmological events, other times they are tied to social events, but the fact is that whether the trickster is flaunting the most sacred customs of the people or upholding them  heroically, whether he is transforming the grand scale of the earth or indulging in petty and harmful activities, his actions are not without meaning, not without ritualistic significance, not without socially redeeming value.<dq> (10)<br><br>So within the compositional demands of mythopoeia lies a definite need for trickster figures, who can shake up the story in a compelling way. As to the universality of those figures, others have mentioned Joseph Campbell, but have not given you any hard references. Fraizer was mentioned too. It<sq>s important to note that their approach is different<colon> Fraizer is famous because he provided the first really through academic approach to mythology that wasn<sq>t theological or overtly judgmental. That said he is still a modernist, and a classicalist, so its modern literary and anthropological influence has waned. Joseph Campbell<sq>s work is more solidly in the <dq>comparative mythology<dq> realm but was definitely influenced/inspired by Fraizer<sq>s work. The notion of mythological archetypes is highly influenced by/derived from/related to [Jung<sq>s theory](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes) of evolutionarily embedded psychological archetypes within the human subconscious, creating the collective unconscious and therefore a sense of a universal psyche to society. <br><br>That said, Campbell believes the trickster was the chief mythological character of the paleolithic world of story.<br><br>>A fool, and a cruel, lecherous cheat, an epitome of the principle of disorder, he is nevertheless the culture\u00adbringer also. And he appeared under many guises, both animal and human. Among the North American Plains Indians his usual form was Coyote. Among the woodland tribes of the north and east, he was the Great Hare, the Master Rabbit, some of whose deeds were assimilated by the Negroes of America to an African rabbit\u00adtrickster whom we know in the folktales of Br<sq>er Rabbit. The tribes of the Northwest Coast knew him as Raven. Blue Jay is another of his forms. In Europe he is known as Reynard the Fox; but also, on a more serious plane, he appears as the devil. ([Primitive Mythology](http<colon>//www.goodreads.com/book/show/589064.Primitive_Mythology), 273)<br><br>These are not always deities though - they are more like preternatural aids to humanity.<br><br>> It is hardly proper to call such a figure a god, or even to think of him as supernatural. He is a super-shaman. And we find his counterparts in myth and legend throughout the world, wherever shamanism has left its mark<colon> in Oceania and Africa, as well as in Siberia and Europe. In Polynesia, Maui is the trickster. We have already witnessed a couple of his feats.* Br<sq>er Rabbit has taught us something of his African form, where he is also Anansi, the spider. Among the Greeks he was Hermes (Mercury), the shape- bhifter and master of the way to the land of the dead, as well as Prometheus, the fire-bringer. In Germanic myth he appeared as the mischief-maker Loki, whose very character was fire and who, at the time of Ragnar\u00f6k, the Twilight of the Gods, will be the leader of the hosts of Hel.  (275)<br><br>Trickster gods seem to be most often found in the beliefs of prehistorical societies and there really isn<sq>t a place for them in the mainstream religious cosmology of things, not without some reinterpretation or a radical rereading. For instance, you could say Satan was a trickster figure, but if you want to compare him to other tricksters then you have to acknowledge some positive aspect of his effects. Trickster figures are very complicated and I think doctrine and theology tend to filter them out of modern religion, or at least simplify their impact as time goes on.<br><br>if you read this far down then congratulations, you have found the actual social science answer for this thread in /r/asksocialscience <br><br>>Downvote inaccurate or shallow unsourced answers. <br><br>http<colon>//i.imgur.com/mSixNsP.gif</p>",

As a direct result of this, a lot of North Korean expatriates in China will risk shady means to help them get out of China (to places like Vietnam or Mongolia  - where their refugee status is recognized).  North Korean females (60<percent> of registered defectors are female) will often be tricked by the Chinese equivalent of <dq>coyotes<dq> and be sold into the sex trade (the threat of being sent back to North Korea is huge and defectors can be forced into pretty much anything). <br><br>Now, if they manage to get to South Korea they will be sent to [Hanawon](http<colon>//articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/09/world/fg-korea-defectors9), which is a resettlement center run by the government.

There are also [various NGOs](http<colon>//pscore.org/en/) that try to  smooth the integration process for defectors.<br><br>Once released from Hanawon defectors are constantly monitored by the South Korean government.  This is done for two reasons<colon> 1) to protect them from reprisal attacks against North Korean loyalists/spies in the South (North Korea goes to great lengths to deter defection) and 2) to watch them to make sure that they aren<sq>t sending information back to North Korea.  <br><br>Overall life isn<sq>t great for North Korean defectors as the constant fear of North Korean reprisal against themselves and their family remaining in North Korea, the trauma from their journey to S.

There<sq>s an important link between contributions to society and having a stake in what the government does, that is, citizens are more likely to care about policies when the source of funding for those policies are coming from their taxes.<br><br>* Likewise, if social programs are funded by oil revenue and then can no longer be funded, it can lead to political instability. With oil, governments have the incentive to hide information about their revenues so that they can have less limitations on how the revenues are used. A key aspect of democracies is the ability to hold the government accountable, without transparency, this is difficult. Less democratic governments might make gasoline prices low in order to appease citizens, but this doesn<sq>t really solve these broader problems.<br><br>* Oil prices are extremely volatile, and the process of nationalization inherently decreases the stability by consolidating production.

Simply put, measures of abstinence-only education do not address the behavioral causes of teen intercourse and pregnancy rates, nor do they teach skills for healthy, positive sexual relationships outside of the realm of marriage, which is unrealistic in many situations. My researched hypothesis is that high teen pregnancy rates from abstinence only education stem from the lack of education of effective contraception. Many youth without comprehensive sex education may already lack the family-based sex education or sex-positive role models. Without basic knowledge of sexuality and sexual intercourse, the process of pregnancy may not be well understood, while at the same time, most youth are still having sex.

CDC<sq>s <dq>Youth Risk Surveillance<dq> for 2015 found that a little more than 41<percent> of high schoolers had had sexual intercourse. For 12th graders, that number was a little over 58<percent>. I<sq>ve seen studies that have suggested the number is as high as 70<percent> by HS graduation. The number of students who have engaged in other sexual behaviors/forms of sex (oral sex, mutual masturbation) is even higher.<br><br>These numbers have been proven to be unaffected by AOE--although I<sq>m not aware of any representative studies where it makes teens more sexually active. So while it doesn<sq>t seem to make the numbers of teens ultimately engaging in sex worse, it doesn<sq>t improve them... And there are other impacts which are really negative and even dangerous. Which brings me to #2 and #3.<br><br>2. They increase guilt and shame.<br><br>If you have already had sex by the time you get AOE (consensual or, more often for the middle-school cohort, as a result of sexual assault or abuse), then you will be severely emotionally impacted by the curriculum that often glamorizes virginity while condemning sex. <br><br>But even if you haven<sq>t had sex, those lessons stay with you. If you, like a majority of your peers, end up having sex, then it comes with an added amount of shame, guilt, and stigma.<br><br>That stigma, studies suggest, makes the teen more likely to engage in sex again, because why not? They<sq>re already <dq>damaged goods.<dq><br><br>This is especially difficult for females. Elizabeth Smart was a young woman who was kidnapped at 14 and immediately raped. She was held captive for 9 months, and even though she had chances to escape, she didn<sq>t. Why? As she often says at speaking engagements, her AOE teacher compared a virgin to a stick of gum, and once you have sex, you<sq>re worthless. As she said, <dq>Nobody chews old gum, you just throw it away.<dq> She said that this analogy made her feel like she had no value or worth because she was no longer a virgin. <br><br>3. They undermine the use of contraceptives to protect against pregnancy and STDs/STIs.<br><br>These programs do two really troubling things<colon> first, they don<sq>t give teens, most of whom WILL have sex, information that can protect them against teen pregnancy and STIs; AND second, they actually focus on the failure rates (which are exaggerated,  misleading or even downright wrong) which undermines teens<sq> confidence in those methods.<br><br>For example, I can remember my HS health teacher explaining that using a condom to protect against HIV was as useful as throwing a golf ball at a volleyball net... If you had enough sex, you WOULD get AIDS (I grew up in the Bible belt during the 1990s, for context--although some of the arguments you hear in curricula TODAY sound like they came from the 1950s!).<br><br>Knowing that AOE became standard policy nationwide in 2006 makes the following passage from the CDC survey all the more interesting<colon><br><br><dq>The prevalence of not having used \r<br>any method to prevent pregnancy decreased during 1991\u20132007 \r<br>(16.5<percent>\u201312.2<percent>) and then did not change significantly during \r<br>2007\u20132015 (12.2<percent>\u201313.8<percent>). The prevalence of not having \r<br>used any method to prevent pregnancy also did not change \r<br>significantly from 2013 (13.7<percent>) to 2015 (13.8<percent>).<dq><br><br>When I was a kid, the AIDS scare was in full-force, and EVERYONE was advocating for condoms. This is one explanation for the increase in their use... But it<sq>s been stalled (and ticking slightly upwards) since then. <br><br>Not using protection means more STIs and more teenage pregnancy. More teen pregnancy means lower lifetime earnings for men and women, increased maternal mortality, as well as a whole host of psychological issues. Also, worse health for the baby. Babies born to teens are more likely to be neglected and abused, at higher risk from accidental injury or death,  to live in single-parent homes, and to grow up to be teen parents themselves.  By the way, comprehensive sex education is correlated with higher use of contraceptives. <br><br>Ok, so now that I<sq>ve shared pretty objective information, let me share my opinion<colon> AOE fucking infuriates me. I really do think it<sq>s a <dq>life or death<dq> issue. We are fucking depriving our children of VITAL information that can keep them from getting sick (potentially with a life-threatening disease), pregnant, or psychological harm. Our kids<sq> lives are more important than any religious or cultural discomfort.<br><br> Because I know I have a bias, I<sq>ve tried for years to find any evidence that it<sq>s useful, and the closest I can get is that it delays the onset of initial sexual activity (average of 18 months). It is unconscionable that this is even a thing.<br><br>In addition to this, it should also be mentioned that AOE completely ignores homosexuality and bisexuality, which has a profoundly negative impact on LGBT youth. Also, the curricula often has religious undertones (sometimes it<sq>s even pretty explicit!), which is a problem because it<sq>s paid for with public $.<br><br>TL;DR<colon> AOE is the perfect storm of shit<colon> based on ignorance, ineffective, and dangerous. <br><br>Edit<colon> not sure why my numbers are all showing up as <dq>1.<dq>, but can<sq>t easily fix it on mobile.

I don<sq>t have an answer but I will offer a set of observations about this question that will help give an answer or serve as criteria for a good answer.  I think there are a few things we need to establish before we can actually get an answer to this question.  <br><br>The first thing we need to do is create some exchange rate between pre-Civil War South dollars and modern dollars.  This is more difficult than it seems for many reasons.  The first is that the old dollar was backed by the gold standard.  The literature about the dynamics of the gold standard relative to modern fiat currency is too rich for me to understand and beyond the scope of this question. But it<sq>s important to remember that the dollar of yesteryear and today mean different things.  <br><br>This comparison of dollars is not impossible and I<sq>ve read papers that do comparisons going back to 1400.  However we need to do a specific account of how much it would cost for a slave to live in the slaveholding South.  Many of the slaves lived in communal dwellings so you need accurate figures for how many slaves lived in those buildings.  How much it cost to build and maintain one which includes labor and materials.  What was the common diet of slaves in the south and how much would it cost.  This poses a special problem because many slaves had to cultivate their own food on the plantations while working in the cotton fields as well.  Are we to assume that the freed slaves would still cultivate food even if they are paid a wage?  Would they have to rent land and materials from the owner to cultivate it (because we all know how well sharecropping worked out for the newly-freed slaves--badly)?  Should we assume that slaves would purchase all the food they need from markets?  Were there even markets that black men could reliable use in the South?  What were the prices at these markets and if they didn<sq>t exist, how do we determine a price?  What about female slaves?  Many worked in the owner<sq>s house as servants, nurses, or cooks.  Is their wage the same despite being far easier work than the cotton fields?  How about all the uncounted economic activity that female slaves engaged in like raising chickens, making clothes, childcare.  How do we measure and account for all that?<br><br>Finally, you need to determine how exactly to pay the wage out in this thought experiment.  Are the slaved paid hourly and if so how would we account for the differences in work hours according to the time of year.  Naturally the harvest of cotton requires alot more labor than when the fields are lying fallow.  Assuming they<sq>re hourly, are they paying taxes on land of any kind or other costs that a white man in the 1850s might pay?  <br><br>**TL<colon>DR--How to answer this question<colon> (1) Equate modern dollars and slaveholding South dollars (not too hard), (2) Come up with how much it costs a slave to live in the South (very hard because of uncounted economic activity, getting accurate prices on food, deal with children<sq>s costs, etc.), and (3) Run the numbers (easy)**</p>",

However, I can at least give you the numbers if they were all paid minimum wage. <br><br>If we use this [census data](http<colon>//mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860), we can find that Virginia had almost 500,000 slaves. If we take that and multiply, just for Virginia, by the current Federal minimum wage of $7.25, we get $3,558,721.25 for a single hour, but we would have to adjust for inflation and look at the one source you provided. I<sq>ll use the number of $400 (2011 dollars) being an average of $94,000. So by dividing our $3 mil by $400 to get something comparable, then multiplying by that average, we get $334,519,797,500. You can, if you wish, go to other states but that should be enough to show that this is a lot.<br><br>The problem here is it<sq>s basically useless. Trying to compare the economy of the 1800s to today is impossible which I feel someone may try and do. So do not take any number as any indication of anything as they are not.

Final consumption in the US is nearly double what it is in Japan (see [this](http<colon>//data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PRVT.PC.KD), you will note how significantly Japan have fallen over the last couple of decades in consumption rankings; this is their stagnation event). Capital (and innovation) chase consumption.<br>2. Durable goods data its annoyingly difficult to find outside the US, Japan last published figures in 2004 (see [this](http<colon>//www.stat.go.jp/english/data/zensho/2004/taikyu/gaiyo1.htm)) which showed PC<sq>s at approximately the same level of penetration as in the US and there is a recent [Google study](http<colon>//services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/Final_Mobile_Internet_Smartphone_Adoption_Insights_2011v2.pdf) which found penetration significantly higher then in the US.<br>3. Mobile technology penetration is insanely high in Asia in general but particularly Japan (again [here](http<colon>//www.stat.go.jp/english/data/zensho/2004/taikyu/gaiyo1.htm)).<br>4. Software is mostly cultural. Japan does produce a great deal of software (as proportion of workforce significantly higher then the US, see [here](http<colon>//www.stat.go.jp/data/roudou/longtime/zuhyou/lt01-a30.xls)) but its consumed in Japan (and Asia in general). Even with language barriers Western cultures are similar enough that software, art and other creative products can cross cultural boundaries with relative ease. The US also takes the lions share of capital, and has for many decades, so would be expected to be an innovative center.<br>5. Regulation, monopolies and other issues can limit innovation. A decade ago the US was behind most of the developed world in cellphone technology and did not significantly contribute to the handset market, the consumer market was far less competitive then in Europe at the time so everyone kept using their flip phones as carriers had no incentive to compete with emerging technology (I recall going back to the UK on a visit in <sq>99 and how clunky my US handset was compared to the flashy ones all by former countrymen were sporting). The US today is significantly behind Europe in consumer banking, the fed running settlement provides for stability but has strongly limited innovation in a number of areas; for example in most of Europe a bank transfer takes seconds where in the US it takes days. Japan, as with everywhere else, has its own artificial constraints on adoption and penetration of innovation. (Governance, Regulation And Innovation, Ugar 2013)<br>6. The (former) Japanese work ethic would foster progress. Most progress is not huge innovative leaps which require huge amounts of creativity but rather a slow iterative process of improvement, a very strong work ethic with the right capital and education in place will foster progress.<br><br>> Does the Japanese people<sq>s inflexible <dq>set in their ways<dq> mentality mean they don<sq>t clamour for technology that makes things more convenient?<br><br>Japan for the last couple of decades seems like a country at war with itself.

Most of America<sq>s debt is not owned by foreign governments, it<sq>s owned in the commercial and financial sectors.  In fact, with currently low interest rates, it<sq>s not a particularly good deal for foreign governments to own US Bonds save for currency-reserve purposes -- they won<sq>t provide a good return in sovereign wealth or pension funds.<br><br>> 4\\. American Manufacturing Isn<sq>t Dead<br><br>Technically true, but it glosses over one important facet.  While US manufacturing on the whole might be growing, most of that growth is coming through increased productivity and mechanization rather than mass employment.  US *employment* in manufacturing has steadily fallen from peak levels in the 70s -- current employment is comparable to *1940* levels ([data](http<colon>//data.bls.gov/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?series_id=CES3000000001&data_tool=XGtable).  This does, of course, have huge impacts on formerly manufacturing towns, since even if the stuff is still being made proportionally less of the town is involved in the making of it.<br><br>> 3\\. Illegal Immigrants Appear to Be Helping the Economy<br><br>Also largely true.  Generally speaking with mainstream economics, extra labour relieving a labour shortage is good for the economy as a whole, and illegal immigrants are most likely in the country for actual (albeit sometimes seasonal) jobs.  It does have follow-on effects on *distribution* of wealth, but that<sq>s another, more subtle matter.<br><br>> 2\\. Deficits Aren<sq>t Always Bad<br><br>True, by conventional economics.  Nations have the freedom to spend *counter-cyclicly*, increasing spending during bad times and cutting back (relatively) during good times.  This is supposed to provide a balancing feedback to the economy, taking up economic slack during down-periods and getting out of the way of the private sector during good periods.  It<sq>s also a backbone to Keynsian economic thought, and according to that school of economics *not* doing this was a contributing factor to the Great Depression (and consequently why the New Deal helped pull the US out of said depression.)<br><br>There<sq>s also an accounting identity to consider<colon> the *net savings* of households, businesses (retained profits), government (surplus/deficit), and foreigners (trade deficit/surplus -- it<sq>s inverted because you<sq>re following dollars and not goods) **must** equal zero.  That<sq>s because money in one hands is debt in another.  It<sq>s impossible for the government, people, and corporations to run a surplus without a substantial and balancing net export, for example.  <br><br>> 1\\. America Doesn<sq>t Have a Debt Crisis (Not Yet, Anyway)<br><br>Also literally true.  The basic definition of a debt crisis is when a government has trouble selling its newly-issued debt to the private sector.  This did happen in the debt-troubled European nations, but it has not yet happened in the United States.  Once a nation cannot sell its debt to interested private parties at expected interest rates, it<sq>s difficult to continue funding without monetizing the debt (having the central bank buy it with newly printed money), sudden and sharp austerity, or default.<br><br>The problem, of course, is that once you<sq>re in a debt crisis it<sq>s too late to do much about it.  The current deficit is governed by choices made years ago, and big governments simply cannot turn on or off the taps on that scale very quickly.  Greece is perhaps the best modern example of a nation that is trying austerity measures in reaction to a current debt crisis -- it<sq>s not going well.<br><br>So the conservative political argument about debt is, boiling it down, about avoiding a *future* debt crisis, and that<sq>s a matter for a crystal ball.  We cannot anticipate market psychology, so we don<sq>t have a hard and fast rule about what level of debt is acceptable and what level isn<sq>t.  It<sq>s also governed by non-financial decisions -- flirting with not increasing the debt ceiling a couple years back (and thus potentially defaulting voluntarily) did more to damage the US<sq>s debt credibility than any amount of recent deficit has.</p>",

They are more likely to be burdened with making a living, and choose that over devotion to a sport.  If you are an American, you don<sq>t realize how sports-obsessed your culture is compared to other places where sports and competition are not as powerfully attractive.  India does not have a basketball court and swimming pool within walking distance of just about every kid, they way the U.S. does.  Parks and recreation spaces are few and undeveloped, so the culture of outdoor play is not nurtured to the extent it is in other places.  There are fewer role models for sport.  Physical education occupies a lower place in the priorities of schools, and they do  not integrate competitive sports the way U.S. schools do where sports are available to everyone year-round from 6 years old to 18.  If you are Indian and your gift is endurance, you might find some success at soccer, but if your gift is flexibility and balance, it is unlikely to be discovered by a gymnastics or diving coach, or even by you.  <br><br>The question could be asked, why do Americans perform so poorly as artists and musicians?  The same factors would explain why.  Because the arts are a priority in India, and the culture supports artists in a way that exceeds the U.S.   It<sq>s just a matter of priorities.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Because anarchism in the leftist sense of the word means abolishing capitalism *and* the state. It<sq>s a form of socialism that belives in organization without the hierarchy of the state. So, apart from your misconception, there<sq>s another common misconception, which is that anarchists are individualists or against organization. So, organize with your colleagues and fellow students, but don<sq>t have a boss (meaning, also don<sq>t *pick* a boss). <br><br>For an anarchist (in the left wing sense of the word) the modern worker is being oppressed first by capitalism, and then by an oppressive and beaurocratic state. Their conflict with other socialists is that other revolutionary socialists believe the state can be replaced by a socialist state that eventually withers naturally when it served it<sq>s purpose. In the end though, you tend to come into a discussion about what a *state* actually is. But if you want to look at how left wing anarchism has been applied, Barcelona during the civil war is an interesting example. It<sq>s hard to use it as a general example since it was during wartime, but a short description is that it was very democratic in a good way and a bad way. The influence of <dq>normal people<dq> increased *a lot* but the it was also very chaotic. Again, in war time though.<br><br>In the right wing sense of the word, that<sq>s usually not called anarchism but instead libertarianism or sometimes anarcho-capitalism. For a libertarian, the conflict is not between *the worker* and his/hers oppressors. Instead the conflict is typically between *the individual* and the oppressor. Because the subject here is the individual and not the worker (who is part of a collective with similar goals) - the oppressor typically *is* the collective. Generally meaning the state. So the freedom you expect from abolishing the state is the freedom to do what you want with your money and your own body.  So yes, both of these movements are opposed to the state but for very different reasons. <br><br>Both of them are kind of <dq>correct<dq> in their assessment of the state. Western modern states are very multifaceted and can be attacked from anyone basically. Western states generally have some kind of social safety net, which are generally paid by taxes. This is wealth distribution. Tax systems look slightly different around the world but the general idea is that poor people get more out of it than rich people - but the rich are still *forced* to contribute to them. This is a violation against their rights in the eyes of libertarians.<br><br>Socialists, however, don<sq>t consider the right to ownership a human right. Here, ownership means ownership of the means of production. Basically, because our economical system (capitalism) is unfair and naturally oppressive, the distribution of money that it spits out is also unfair and oppressive. Meaning, just because you have money doesn<sq>t mean that you deserve it or even that it<sq>s yours in a philosophical sense. In that sense, for a left wing anarchist, one of the few things that the state does *right* is taxes and wealth redistribution. The problem they have with the state is that it at the same time protects and serves the capitalist system.<br><br>There<sq>s a lot more to be said on the subject but that<sq>s the basic division. The two agree that the state should be abolished but for very different reasons, and at their core, they have very different philosophies where libertarians stand more on typical liberal thinkers - adam smith, john locke etc. and anarchists are still fundamentally standing on marx + someone criticizing marx (bakunin, kropotkin).<br><br>Your typical popular culture will get these to mixed up. Usually the anarchist <dq>A<dq> is still reserved for young punk gangs / people you<sq>d generally suspect are leftists. But often enough, your stereotypical old man in a cottage saying he wants the state out of his pockets (or Ron Swanson from Parks and Rec) is referred to, wrongly, as an anarchist when what they really are, is libertarian.</p>",

There are sabre-toothed tigers outside; they are called transnational corporations which are among the most tyrannical totalitarian institutions that human society has devised.

You have to protect the cage when it\u2019s under attack from even worse predators from outside, like private power. And you have to expand the floor of the cage, recognizing that it\u2019s a cage.

The poor, in this view, are less capable not because of inherent traits, but because the very context of poverty imposes load and impedes cognitive capacity.

I<sq>m working on an extension of this research that includes a neuro-psych component.  Basically, we repeated experiment one and hooked people up to the EEG.  I<sq>m hesitant to cite my own research because I<sq>m still collecting data and writing my introduction, but I wouldn<sq>t be very in touch with my data if I couldn<sq>t recognize trends right off the bat.<br><br>Essentially, what we are seeing is that participants who report low income (and some middle-income participants [~30<percent>]) experience significant cognitive disruption (the equivalent of a letter grade) on cognitive tests when we induce thoughts about money and financial responsibility in the lab.<br><br>Physiologically, we know that there is a certain degree of emotional lateralization when it comes to your brain.

However bare in mind that these investments are in things like trains, motorways, hotel capacity and general use stadiums as well as a prolonged tourism boost. Brazil will get nowhere near recouping their outlay though and Russia and Qatar are also likely to be massive losses. In terms of financially sustainable world cups, some of the 2018-2022 bids looked to be self-financing and would have represented better options than Russia and Qatar.

The UK is one example.<br><br>> * This is partly because of search frictions and therefore lower turnover<colon> a higher minimum wage makes it relatively costlier for an employee to quit and seek another job.<br><br>> * The minimum wage in the US has declined through the years when adjusted for inflation (so it has been higher during periods of robust employment) and is also one of the lowest minimum wages as a share of the median wage (so it is higher in some countries with labour markets which are in no worse shape than that of the US).<br><br>> * Minimum wage workers are very likely to spend their higher wages, and therefore this legislation would provide a macroeconomic stimulative jolt.<br><br>> * By not raising the minimum wage, many lower-income workers will have to seek government benefits of some kind anyways, and therefore the cost (so to speak) of not raising the wage will be passed on to the taxpayer. Furthermore, the prevailing economic conditions have eroded the bargaining power of these workers, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. A minimum wage would restore some of the balance in their relationships with employers.<br><br>> * Yes, it would be inflationary, but that\u2019s great<colon> broad-based, wage-driven inflation is exactly what the economy needs right now.<br><br>> **Against**<br><br>> * Consistent with economic theory, a number of economists have found that raising the minimum wage leads to lower employment in the real world.<br><br>> * Even if search frictions rendered the preceding statement incorrect, it\u2019s not at all clear that fewer quits, or lower turnover generally, is a good thing.<br><br>> * About the stimulus effect<colon> 1) Economists disagree on this as well, 2) The higher cost would be passed on to customers who use the products of companies paying a higher minimum wage, and who also were likely to have spent that marginal dollar, and 3) There is evidence that in the past, the additional spending brought by the higher wages was fuelled by correspondingly higher indebtedness, which is not to be encouraged.<br><br>> * This is not a period of impressively rising wages and productivity generally, and thus employers are less likely to believe that the workers they hire at above-market wages, ie the minimum wage, are likely to grow into their wages. Thus the likelihood of a bigger unemployment effect is higher than it used to be. (This is uniquely Tyler Cowen\u2019s point.)<br><br>> * As a boost to lower-income workers, it isn\u2019t very cost-effective when compared against other ideas. Matthews writes<colon> \u201cAccording to a 2007 study by the CBO, an increase in the minimum wage to $7.25, like that eventually passed that year, would increase wages by $11 billion, of which $1.6 billion went to poor families. By contrast, increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit for large families (as happened in the stimulus bill) and for single people would cost $2.4 billion, of which $1.4 billion would go to poor families.\u201d<br><br>(Although I don<sq>t like the <dq>consistent with economic theory/contrary to economic theory<dq> framing. Both are consistent! It depends on which model of the labor market you are using).<br><br>***<br><br>Conclusion<colon><br><br>> We think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to be conflicted about this issue, which is another way of saying that we\u2019re conflicted about this issue. That a modest federal wage increase wouldn\u2019t have much of an employment effect is entirely believable. And while its stimulative potential is dubious, a higher wage would bring needed relief to struggling low-income workers.<br><br>> Still, we could be wrong, and this kind of intervention is something to be cautious about, even if it would only be a very small lurch in the direction of a more-calcified labour market. It\u2019s just not clear to us which of the above sets of arguments is stronger.<br><br>> For the same reasons that a basic minimum income would be an improvement on the patchwork of extant safety-net provisions \u2014 less complicated, less likely to bring about unintended consequences, directly targets poverty and inequality rather than treating one of their symptoms \u2014 we think that a redistributive, post-outcome transfer mechanism would probably be better than a minimum wage hike. A basic income, wage subsidies, and a more-generous earned income tax credit all seem like superior alternatives.<br><br>> But none of those alternatives is legitimately on the table, while many states continue to raise their minimum wages and general support for the idea is building.<br><br>> So what\u2019s the right stand to take on the minimum wage in the absence of a better idea that\u2019s politically feasible?<br><br>> Honestly, we don\u2019t know.<br><br>(Another caveat - there<sq>s reason to think of the EITC and MW as [complements, not substitutes](http<colon>//www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/interview-dube-eitc-and-minimum-wage-complements).)<br><br>***<br><br>I<sq>d conclude that the evidence we have suggests that the disemployment effect of small minimum wage increases is pretty small. I<sq>d say there is a good case for a small increase in the minimum wage - say, to $9 or $10.

So, the crisis was not precipitated by the fact that people were buying and selling credit default swaps. The crisis was precipitated by the slow collapse of the housing bubble.  However, the fact that all these securities were based on mortgage lending, whose payback rates depended greatly on housing prices, magnified the impact of the collapse of housing prices so that major financial institutions faced major losses.  <br><br>Credit default swaps are not inherently bad financial instruments.  They ensure a payout for the holder of the swap if someone defaults on a loan.  They are similar to an option, or a short sell, in some respects.  However, their real danger is that for a relatively small outlay of cash (the fee on the CDS) you can hold someone liable for massive payments if a credit event occurs.  In this light, the danger of too many CDS<sq>s is really just the same as the danger of overleveraging.

                "answer": "<p>One typical answer is that settler mortality from disease is related to building inclusive institutions or extractive institutions. Inclusive institutions are good for long-term GDP growth, extractive institutions are bad for it.  Tropical diseases, and malaria in particular, are one of the main causes of relatively high rates of settler mortality, and obviously are endemic to areas closer to the equator.  The real basis for this argument is Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson<sq>s <dq>Colonial origins of comparative development<dq> 2001 AER article ([pdf](http<colon>//economics.mit.edu/files/4123), [summary](http<colon>//wikisum.com/w/Acemoglu,_Johnson,_and_Robinson<colon>_The_colonial_origins_of_comparative_development), and it<sq>s even important enough to get a short [Wiki article](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_origins_of_comparative_development) which very rare for articles).  Acemoglu and Robinson later developed this argument into a full book called *Why Nations Fail* (and a corresponding blog of the same name).  Both of these outline their broader argument which is not just related to settler mortality or the equator, but a real comparative institutionalist perspective on how institutional forms are related to long term economic growth more broadly.<br><br>Some have questioned this thesis, particularly the empirical backing of the original article (David Albuoy has a pretty thorough attempt to refute the empirical origins in his 2012 piece <dq>The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development<colon> An Empirical Investigation<colon> Comment<dq> [pdf](http<colon>//davidalbouy.net/AJRrev.pdf), but you should read the Acemoglu response as well) (this is his third attempt to takedown this article, I believe, with early critiques coming out in 2004 and 2006), but the original Acemoglu et al. argument is still very widely cited and, to my knowledge, the most convincing explanation for this correlation (Acemoglu<sq>s strong responses to Albuoy, to my mind, also bolster the robustness of the argument).<br><br>The causal chain looks roughly<colon><br><br>Tropical disease-->settler mortality-->institutional form-->long term growth.<br><br>This obviously does not explain *everything* (for instance, why some areas have settlers in the first place while others don<sq>t--for that you<sq>d need to go for other explanations, many focusing on the directionality of trade networks/geographical limitations for diffusions in places like Jared Diamond<sq>s *Guns, Germs, and Steel* or Ian Morris<sq>s *Why West Rules--For Now*), but it does help explain some differences, particularly in colonial settlements.  However, some of these GDP disparities were already in place by about 1500 when these settler movements start.  If I recall, it does not take into account things like population density at (and immediately after) colonization, which also obviously has an effect on what sort of institutions settlers can set up.   Looking at it this way, again, disease, this time diseases that jumped from livestock to humans like small pox, plays a role but it<sq>s the opposite one<colon> here, disease lowers indigenous (rather than settler) population density and makes colonization easier and enables again more inclusive institutions.  Many of the rich colonies far from the equator basically had their indigenous populations wiped out or otherwise displaced almost entirely--not just America and Canada, but Argentina, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and (if focusing on Khoisan rather than the various Bantus) South Africa--presumably leading to different institutional forms which led to different long term growth rates.  Compare this to places like Brazil, Bolivia, Southern Mexico, most of Sub-Saharan Africa, most Melanesian and Polynesian Islands, etc. where indigenous groups make up a much larger percentage of the population.  Natives can also be displaced or incorporated in other ways, and disease does not necessarily have to play a role (see, for example, the growth of the Han and the Russians); but again we see that institutions people set up become important, and that the rapid growth of groups often occurs on East-West axes rather than North-South ones (Diamond and others argue that crops and other technologies can move more easily East-West where climates tend to be similar rather than North-South where climates differ at a faster rate).  In these cases too the inclusive institutions help the indigenous groups to a certain degree, but the institutions seem to have been set up largely with the Han/Russian <dq>settlers<dq> in mind and in these regions the Han/Russians tend to hold the dominant economic positions.<br><br>Once extractive institutions are set for whatever reason, Acemoglu and Robinson<sq>s book argues pretty convincingly, they do tend to have pretty serious effects on long term growth.  Slavery being an example of perhaps the most extractive institution with long term negative effects on both origin countries for slaves and the economic development of areas with slave-based economies, but we can<sq>t really understand slavery from a purely <dq>areas with malaria<dq> perspective, because obviously European racial ideology (as well as the the form of pre-existing institutions--look at how the Japanese protests helped end the Portuguese East Asian slave trade) played a huge role in the growth of slavery.   <br><br>So we can say, a variety of reasons, we tend to see extractive institutions closer to the equator and inclusive one further away from it.  Some areas that have inclusive institutions today had some advantages around 1500 (technology including high calorie per acre crops; favorable disease environments) that helped them expand rapidly, setting up extractive institutions in some places and inclusive institutions in others.  These advantages c. 1500 were to some degree facilitated by differences in physical geography.  We also tend to see inclusive institutions resulting in higher long-term economic growth than extractive institutions.</p>",

The jobless rate for all veterans also edged down to 6.6 percent.<br><br>> **The unemployment rate for male Gulf War-era II veterans (8.8 percent) was higher than the rate for male nonveterans (7.5 percent) in 2013.** The unemployment rates differed by age. Male Gulf War-era II veterans age 18 to 24 had a higher unemployment rate than male nonveterans of the same age group (24.3 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively). For those age 25 to 34, male veterans also had a higher rate than male nonveterans (9.2 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively). **For men 35 and older, unemployment rates were little different for Gulf War-era II veterans and nonveterans.**<br><br>Looks like nonveterans were better off, though it<sq>s possible those veterans who were employed had more stable jobs, or earned more money. Data could be skewed by the extreme low end of the spectrum (veterans suffering from physical or mental ailments but still seeking employment). Hard to argue that veterans are better off from this data, though.<br><br>From [RAND](http<colon>//afs.sagepub.com/content/36/3/420.refs), on divorce rates<colon><br><br>> Preliminary analyses for all three stages of the project have been completed. Linear probability analyses of the entire military population 1995-2002 indicates that compared to comparable civilians, military men and women are more likely to get married, and that military men are less likely to get divorced while serving in the military. Relative to comparable civilians, military women are more likely to get divorced. However, upon exiting the military, both veteran men and women have higher rates of divorce than comparable civilians, as indicted in the NLSY-79 using fixed effects models. Taken together, these findings suggest that the military provides incentives to marry (for men and women) and remain married (for men), but that **once the servicemembers return to civilian life and these incentives are absent, they suffer higher rates of marital dissolution than comparable civilians.**<br><br>So that<sq>s a negative for divorce.<br><br>Regarding the other two categories, I will edit in information<colon> plan on digging through the VA<sq>s data at a later point because this is an interesting question!<br><br>**Brief analysis<colon>** I think military service has great *potential* to be a vehicle for social mobility. In practice, however, I<sq>m not sure the transition phase is managed well enough, particularly in getting veterans into college, or whatever they are looking to do once their active duty time is up.<br><br>One of the major problems with the GI Bill is that veterans wind up enrolling with low quality, for-profit institutions (DeVry, ITT Tech, University of Phoenix, etc.), and they wind up exhausting their educational benefits with little gain outside of some cash in their pocket. <br><br>Additionally, military on the job training (OJT) is often not easily applied to a civilian job. That<sq>s true for both every day duties (you might be working with highly specialized equipment not used elsewhere), and management techniques.<br><br>As for relationship success, the military experience (as RAND shows in their research) greatly inhibits successful relationships. Military members get married younger, have to deal with a high stress environment (long hours, somewhat frequent relocation and separation for up to a year and a half). I am inclined to agree with RAND in their conclusion that if it weren<sq>t for the frequent deployment cycles, marriages would probably have greater success rate than they do now.</p>",

For some context <sq>Keynes<sq> is an oft cited economist whose work has been so high politicized, used and abused to justify government spending that it no longer bears resemblance to his original work.  Keynes famously said at a conference of Keynesian economists that he was the only non-Keynesian in attendance. <br><br>The primary engine of the US economy is a core service sector of highly skilled and educated professionals with specialized industry knowledge and technological advantages when compared to other countries (especially in the tech sector, medical, financial services, and business services sectors).  <br><br>This has largely replaced the manufacturing focused economy that was dominant until the 70s. <br><br>Secondary and tertiary sectors such as construction, hospitality (restaurants), and retail are largely dependent upon that core service sector.<br><br>The US military budget is around 4.4<percent> of the GDP and is currently relatively low when compared to the other decades since WWII (only the 90s is lower I believe).<br><br>While not insignificant there is no rational way to conclude that the US economy is dependent upon war or the military.

What<sq>s interesting about that work, <dq>How to Pay for the War<dq>, is that Keynes was also advocating income distribution from the workers, would be saving and paying for the war through taxation, to the government. It was basically Keynes way of answering the question, <dq>How is England going to pay for WW2?<dq>. <br><br>I like Keynes for his take on labor markets and prices. Sticky prices are the reason why it takes so long for markets to collaborate (contracts, menu costs, etc). The whole notion that Keynes supported unlimited gov. spending is preposterous, though, since economics is primarily concerned with how to efficiently allocate scarce resources and Keynes was, very evidently, aware of this.<br><br> <br>Can gov. spending alleviate the pain of a recession or, god-forbid, a depression? More-than-likely, depending if the money spent would have a good multiplier-effect (that is, would that area of the economy affected by gov. spending also spend that money - the initial splash that amounts to wave and wave reaching across a lake, except in this cash it<sq>s an economy). But this wasn<sq>t Keyne<sq>s primary concern - at least in my opinion. It was more to do with indicators of how a market is doing or what is preventing markets from collaborating.<br><br>The keynesian cross and LR-SR models were excellent extractions and interpretations of what keynes was trying to say about how inventories can be a good indicators of whether or not people over-spent or under-spend based on inventory quantities. That<sq>s a good indicator of how an economy is doing. <br><br>In either regards, no the U.S. Economy isn<sq>t dependent on War. It has cost the taxpayer too much money, exacerbated the deficit and added to the debt tremendously, and while the multiplier-effect can be felt, the crowding-out effect is greater because government is soaking up the country<sq>s savings through higher taxation. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Yes. Most people have abandoned other systems in favor of base ten now, due to the domination of western culture, but historically there have been several different counting systems used throughout the world.<br><br>The thing that defines the counting system is what method people use to finger count (or in some cases, if they even use fingers at all). Our system comes from the Romans, who counted by using each digit as representing a counted object. The ancient Germanic tribes developed a different system, where they used the thumb to point to the sections of each finger. This gave them a base twelve number system (something we can still see today in spoken language, where there are words for eleven and twelve instead of <dq>one-teen<dq> and <dq>two-teen<dq> in English and German, but not in Latin based languages).<br><br>Several other finger-counting methods created different base systems. There are two ways to get base twenty (which was used by several native American cultures), fingers and toes or using three positions for fingers (extended, halfway down and down). The Sumerians and Babylonians used the Germanic method on the right hand and the Latin method on the left to get a base sixty system. The Ngiti of the Congo use a counting tool made of two sticks bound together at a right angle that gives them a base four system. Some tribes in New Guinea use pointing to several different body parts and their system is base twenty-seven. Several North American tribes use base eight because they count using the spaces in between fingers. Base 5 is common due to digit counting on one hand. Something that<sq>s fun, but has no known historical usage in binary finger counting, where you use the finger up as 1 and down as 0 and each finger from thumb to pinky is a digit. This can be counted very fast once you get used to it and you can count to thirty-two on one hand and on thousand twenty four using two hands.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>To answer this question you need understand prison gangs, why they form and how they provide additional security and governance that isn<sq>t provided by the formal prison governance. I<sq>m going to base this post off of Skarbek<sq>s work on the role of gangs in the Californian prison system.<br><br>Inmates need things that aren\u2019t provided by the prison their staying in. Firstly they need to enforce private property, the prison guards do provide some help for this, (for instance you can get a lock box) but there are many types of products for which you can<sq>t use this on. As everyone knows there is a wide spread demand for illicit drugs in prison, more recently there has been a rise in prisoners smuggling cell phones in, these are against prison rules and are confiscated by guards. These are all traded between prisoners.<br><br>Now this raises the question, what happens if someone steals your heroine? Well your obviously are not going to go to the guards, so instead you go to your gang mates and they beat up the person that stole it.<br><br>There are also two other reasons to have prison gangs. Prisons have a series of common resources that are available for everyone but have to be shared, an example of this is a basketball court or prison gym. These are limited resources that are often oversubscribed need to be managed and this is typically done by gangs rather than officers.<br><br>Add to this that prisons are generally more violent anyway, it\u2019s very rare that you<sq>ll get involved in a riot in a shopping mall but far more common in prison. Gangs help mitigate this problem because it means that if you are attacked then at least you have someone to back you up and defend you.<br><br>It\u2019s important to understand that this additional governance doesn\u2019t have to be provided by gangs. In fact it didn<sq>t use to be, for about 100 years (1851-1957) there was no gangs within the Californian prison system. Instead rules were enforced by less formalised norms collectively known as the Convicts Code. This was a series of simple rule such as \u201cdon<sq>t rat on people\u201d or \u201cpay your debts\u201d.<br><br>This was primarily a representational based system, everyone know how trustworthy you are and acts accordingly. If you have a high reputation you also have more security and more economic welfare (if you can call having more drugs wealth). It\u2019s a bit like the underground version of trip advisor. This was enforced unilaterally, it was up to the aggrieved party to enforce breaches in the code, it was also decentralised and disorganised.<br><br>The Convicts Code started breaking down in the late 50s and had full collapsed by the 70s. There were multiple reasons for this. You had a larger prison population which meant that it was harder to know everyone\u2019s individual reputations, you also had more first time prisoners, people that didn\u2019t understand the rules and norms that were previously used govern prison. What\u2019s more you have more young people in prison, its well know that young people are more impulsive than older people. Finally you have a more diverse prison population, homogeneous societies tend to be better at enforcing norms.<br><br>What replaces the convict\u2019s code is a gang based system of governance which you might call a community responsibility system. <br><br>Everyone is part of a gang, everyone is responsible for the actions of each individual in that gang, this creates an incentive to monitor and prevent bad behaviour and helps solve dispute between gangs.<br><br>To give an example of how this works in practice, imagine if one of your fellow gang members stole from someone of another gang. You\u2019re all going to be held responsible for that individual\u2019s actions and could be attacked because of it. There are a number of things you might do to mitigate this, you might tell that gang member not to steal in the first place, or you could make them pay for what they stole. If this isn\u2019t possible you could either hand him over to be attacked by the opposing gang or even attack him yourself. People see gangs as causing violence, in reality they are a response to violence and are there to reduce and manage it.<br><br>So how does race play into this?<br><br>I don\u2019t deny that some of these prisoners are racists but I also don\u2019t think race can in and of itself explain the rise of gangs.<br>Yes all gangs are segregated by race, but for many it<sq>s not by choice but due to the structure of the prison environment. When all the white people are part of the Aryan Brotherhood and your looking around for what gang to join you don\u2019t choice the Mexican Mafia.<br><br>It\u2019s almost identical to any clan or tribe based system of governance, these systems are almost always based of off ethnic identity. People are biologically designed to divide the world into an in group and an out group, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that prisoners use already existing racial categories rather than create their own from scratch.<br><br>Dividing group by race also means that it\u2019s easier to identify how is in which group, you just need to look at someone\u2019s face. If you were to divide people along say religious lines or by their local counties you wouldn\u2019t get the same instant recognition.<br><br>So why doesn<sq>t this happen in female prisons? Well I\u2019m no expert but I<sq>m going to suggest two reasons. There are far less prisoners, the highest number of women the California prison system has ever held is only 12,000 for men it\u2019s closer to 180,000.<br><br>Second reason, women are less violent. Most female offenders are in for non violent crimes, only 35<percent> have committed some form of violent offense compared to 57<percent> of male prisoners. This provides less incentive to form gangs because female inmates have greater security.<br><br>These two facts means that it\u2019s easier to use reputational based systems of governance and this is exactly what we see. Women come together in either pairs or small \u201cfamilies\u201d, they take on a set role either as a mum or a dad and sometimes they have \u201cchildren\u201d that they monitor. No organised violence, no organised crime, no dividing along ethnic groups. Just simple norm based governance rather than the more institutional gang based governance we see on male prisons.<br><br>[How Prison Gangs Govern the American Penal System - David Skarbek](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O_ih7t25jY)<br></p>",

Poor Blacks vote overwhelmingly Democratic, as do poor Whites, except in the South where poor White<sq>s preferences are a little murkier.  Andrew Gelman does a good job of explaining this in *Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State*.  <br><br>The book<sq>s paradoxical conclusion is this<colon> Rich states and poor people vote Democratic, while poor states and rich people vote Republican.  The way to reconcile the contradiction is that in red states income is a much more robust predictor of your voting habits than in blue states.  So, in Connecticut, a rich blue state, income does a less good job of predicting the voting habits of wealthy and middle class voters, many of whom vote Democratic despite their wealth.  In Alabama, a poor red state, the votes of people who have above-average incomes are very well predicted by their incomes.  And rich, white, Southerners are *the* most conservative people in the United States.  In Mississippi in 2012, Obama only got 10<percent> of whites in the state to vote for him.  If you went to a polling station in a rich, white suburb of Atlanta, or Tallahassee, or Jackson, I<sq>d guess that well over 95<percent> of people would be voting Republican.  Why?  Gelman goes into the nuances in his book, but it has a lot to do with religion and values which are more important to rich Republicans than any other group.<br><br>Another interesting finding that comes out of people researching voting habits by demographic characteristics is the existence of two kinds of whites.  White people<sq>s voting habits basically differ based on what side of the Mason-Dixon they live on.  Southern Whites are *extremely* conservative, whereas Northerners basically split the vote between Democrats and Republicans.  That<sq>s why Republicans handily win southern states with the country<sq>s largest minority populations.<br><br><br>**TL;DR The poorest 10<percent> of Americans are more liberal than the richest in general as measured by preference for the Democratic Party.

                "answer": "<p>At a simple level, we can just look at this ourselves.  Lets assume you want recent numbers.  The General Social Survey includes a lot of this information.  Luckily, it is publicly available online and you can do simple analysis right in your browser through the SDA archive at Berkeley.  [Link](http<colon>//sda.berkeley.edu/sdaweb/analysis/?dataset=gss12).<br><br>So, the survey has always included income questions, but it<sq>s hard to compare this over time without doing something more sophisticated than I feel like doing right now.  However, in 2006, they introduced a new variable, RINCOM06, which classed people into one of 25 income brackets, with each bracket containing between 11.1<percent> and 0.6<percent> of the population for a given year.  The survey is now done every two years, so we have 06, 08, 10, 12.  The bottom four brackets (those making up to $5,000) together are 9.3<percent> of the sample.  The top four brackets together (those making over $90,000) together are 8.3<percent> of the sample.<br><br>So, now that we have identified the richest and poorest ~10<percent> in the sample, we need to figure out how to measure conservatism.  I<sq>ll do the simplest, self identification along a political spectrum, and will leave the remainder as an exercise for the reader (after I show the results, I<sq>ll explain how to get them using the SDA browser interface).  The easiest variable to use here is political views, POLVIEWS, which asks based on a seven point scale <dq>very conservative, conservative, slightly conservative, moderate, slightly liberal, liberal, very liberal<dq>.  <br><br>Here<sq>s a [imgur album of the results](http<colon>//imgur.com/a/LpzuC), edited in MS Paint for your reading ease (I have neither STATA nor any photo editing software on this computer, so everything is basic).  As you can see, the rich are more conservative than the poor.  17.0<percent> of the poor are conservative or extremely conservative, versus 27.6<percent> of the rich.  If we include <dq>slightly conservative<dq>, it<sq>s 33.1<percent> versus 48.1<percent>.  The last image + description in the album should tell you all you need to know to replicate this data, and find more questions that can help get at social, economic, moral, and religious conservatism.  I<sq>ll start you off and say the standard question for religious conservatism is the variable BIBLE<colon> <br><br>>*Which of these statements comes closest to describing your feelings about the Bible? 1. The Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, word for word. 2. The Bible is the inspired word of God but not everything in it should be taken literally, word for word. 3. The Bible is an ancient book of fables, legends, history, and moral precepts recorded by men.*  <br><br>I don<sq>t happen to know if there are as standard questions for <dq>moral<dq>, social, and economic conservatism. The results obviously do not include statistical significance/margins of errors, but the GSS is a fairly large sample, especially if you<sq>re using multiple years (be careful if you<sq>re using smaller subsamples, of course.

If you look at a simple measure such as the Gini coefficient (http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality) you will see that the most economically homogeneous countries are in Scandinavia while the United States is much more middle of the pack with far more wealth inequality. Sure this may be skewed by the possibility that redistributive policies diminish inequality so there may be a problem of endogeneity, but it appears more likely that the ethnic, historical, and economic homogeneity of a place like Scandinavia enables larger social programs as the safety net isn<sq>t caring for as many people. For this reason you see strong right wing xenophobic movements in these countries against immigrants (many Middle Eastern) who are moving and increasing the number of those relying on transfer payments as they disrupt this homogeneity (ethnically and economically). There are similar movements in the United States for similar reasons.<br><br>Regardless of the root causes of the inequality, the fact is it exists now and attempting to implement even broader social programs in a far more economically unequal society would result in even more being caught in the safety nets of the United States which are already fairly costly.<br><br>Importantly, it is not as if Sweden has been immune from bloated social programs running up deficits. Sweden is succeeding in running a healthy nation while contending with continual dehomogenization by cutting back on pensions and transfer payments, effectively approaching a more <dq>American<dq> safety net. This is largely how they have been able to turn years of budget deficit into budget surplus under a center-right government (on the world political scale). See<colon> http<colon>//www.csmonitor.com/Business/Stefan-Karlsson/2012/0517/Sweden-a-spending-reduction-success-story.<br><br>Therefore, while undoubtedly in direct comparison Sweden<sq>s social programs are much larger in scope (while smaller in real terms), they are enabled by a more homogeneous population paying higher taxes, but even then they were becoming to costly and required reform (as many argue is necessary here in the United States).<br><br>So for them to work in the United States due to its size and economic inequality they would have to be incredibly efficient and include a raise in taxes (politically deadly, another reason the policies won<sq>t work, just the implementation, as orderly-chaos says). Sweden survived its bloated budget and reformed by increasing efficiency in their programs and turning to solutions seen as maybe <dq>right-wing<dq> even here in the United States. http<colon>//blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/30074.<br><br>And here Paul Krugman (http<colon>//krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/sweden-sweden-as-conservative-icon/) is astonished that Sweden can be seen as a <dq>right-wing haven<dq> and his point is well taken. Sweden still has huge government involvement. They have very high taxes which allow for large programs. A key difference is theirs are very efficient with a mix of privatization, allowing for-profit services to run social programs.<br><br>This comes to my conclusion<colon> In Sweden these ultra-efficient social programs are supported by a tax rate that is politically unfeasible in the United States. They are administered to a less economically heterogeneous population which can benefit more or less proportionally from the social programs. Lastly, the control over the public sector administered by for-profit industries in Sweden is 1) similar to how the services in the US work although far more centralized, but 2) this blend requires even closer and more costly monitoring that would be difficult in a decentralized polity and far more needy populace such as the US.<br><br>This ended up jumbled and now I<sq>m just frustrated.</p>",

Modern biological concepts of race can be implemented objectively with molecular genetic data through hypothesis-testing. Genetic data sets are used to see if biological races exist in humans and in our closest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. Using the two most commonly used biological concepts of race, chimpanzees are indeed subdivided into races but humans are not. Adaptive traits, such as skin color, have frequently been used to define races in humans, but such adaptive traits reflect the underlying environmental factor to which they are adaptive and not overall genetic differentiation, and different adaptive traits define discordant groups. There are no objective criteria for choosing one adaptive trait over another to define race. As a consequence, adaptive traits do not define races in humans. Much of the recent scientific literature on human evolution portrays human populations as separate branches on an evolutionary tree. A tree-like structure among humans has been falsified whenever tested, so this practice is scientifically indefensible. It is also socially irresponsible as these pictorial representations of human evolution have more impact on the general public than nuanced phrases in the text of a scientific paper. Humans have much genetic diversity, but the vast majority of this diversity reflects individual uniqueness and not race.<br><br>It would, of course, be ridiculous to suggest that this fact means that racism is imaginary.

                "answer": "<p>The general approach to race in the social sciences has been to see the concept of genetically distinct racial groups as scientifically meaningless, having no real biological basis. This is perhaps best articulated in the famous [statement](http<colon>//www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583) put out by the American Anthropological Association in 1998, which for most students, and unfortunately many scholars, marked the end of the debate on the issue. <br><br>I think, however, there has been a degree of confusion in how the social sciences have communicated with the biological sciences in this regard. For example, most sociologists/anthropologists argue from the basic assumption that race, as a concept, defines a group of people who share some kind of similar biological essence, and, as such, that racial groups, if they existed, would be sharply discontinuous. They will then point out that there are no single alleles distinctive of a particular race (which skirts the issue that scientific concepts synonymous with race often rely on multi-variate or multi-locus statistics to make classifications) or else repeat Lewontin<sq>s argument that inter-racial variation accounts for an insignificantly small proportion of total genetic variation in humans, to refute what is admittedly an overly simplistic essentialist taxonomy which has never really been seriously proposed within biology.  <br><br>In other words, and as argued by Neven Sesardic in a comprehensive, though flawed, article on the topic, it may be the case that the social sciences have gratuitously burdened the concept of race with a range of demands which are almost impossible for any biological concept to fulfil. As Dobzhansky claimed, there is no \u201ccareful and objective definition of race that would permit delimitation of races as exact, non-overlapping, discrete entities,\u201d because in that case we would not be talking about race but about species- notwithstanding the fact that even most species concepts are not so rigid as to assume that all members of a species will share the characteristics that supposedly define that species. <br><br>As many commenters have already pointed out, the concept of race is not a common one in biology- but it is probably best understood as a population of organisms which belong to the same species, yet differ with regard to the frequencies of alternative alleles in a number of loci. And, while I am by no means an expert in this area, I think that it is clear that there is a biological basis for arguing that groups of people with different geographical ancestries will have different frequencies of different alleles. One example can be found in an article by Rosenberg et al., which analysed the multilocus genotypes of 1,056 individuals from 52 populations and found that it was possible to identify six main genetic clusters, five of which corresponded to major geographic regions. The crucial and controversial question here is whether or not these heterogeneous populations overlap with our \u201ccommon-sense\u201d division of races, or certain racial taxonomies which have been proposed. <br><br>One example which appears to answer in the affirmative is a study by Risch et al, which analysed genetic data for 326 microsattellite markers on a sample of 3636 subjects and found that genetic data clustered into four categories, which showed \u201cnear perfect correspondence with the four self-reported race/ethnicity categories\u201d of the participants (in this case White, African American, East Asian, and Hispanic). To quote Risch (in Tang et al. 2005) <dq>The correspondence between genetic cluster and self-identified race/ethnicity is remarkably high\u2026 Accordingly, in this case, major self-identified race/ethnicity and genetic cluster are effectively synonymous.\u2019\u2019 Another example is Xing et al (2009), whose analysis of 554 individuals from 27 worldwide populations revealed \u201cdiscernible genetic differentiation among almost all identified populations in our sample,\u201d finding that \u201cindividuals can be clearly assigned to defined populations on the basis of SNP genotypes,\u201d and <dq>accurately classified into continental groups.\u201d<br><br>This is not to say that such articles \u201cprove\u201d racial naturalism- and the authors themselves have cautioned against their usage in this way. It is probably better to make the more modest claim that there may be some degree of correspondence between common place racial categories and identifiable genetic clusters (the work of Risch, for example, defends the position that an individual\u2019s self-identified race provides useful information for medical practice) although this is of course debatable, and depends entirely on how fine grained one wishes to make their distinctions. For example, Tishkoff et al (2009) conducted a genetic analysis similar to Rosenberg\u2019s, studying \u201c121 African populations, four African American populations, and 60 non-African populations for patterns of variation at 1327 nuclear microsatellite and insertion/deletion markers.\u201d When the statistical software was instructed to provide 7 groupings, 5 of them were Sub-Saharan African.  As Hochman points out, \u201cA racial reading of this would tell us that there is one Saharan African/European/Middle Eastern/Central Asian/Indian race, one Eastern Asian/Oceanic/American race, and five sub-Saharan African races.\u201d Obviously such a typology is quite remote from our everyday racial classifications. At the same time, Tishkoff et al. reports that they \u201cidentified 14 ancestral population clusters in Africa that correlate with self-described ethnicity and shared cultural and/or linguistic properties,\u201d \u2013 and this raises some interesting questions about the scientific utility of a race/ethnicity distinction. <br><br>Another example can be taken from the field of forensic anthropology, although it must be carefully interpreted. As Sauer argued in a famous article, forensic anthropologists can rather reliably determine an individual\u2019s race (if this is simplistically defined as white, black, asian, etc.) from skeletal remains. It is, he states, \u201cusually possible using morphometric and morphoscopic criteria to assign an unidentified specimen to one of three or four races\u201d While his cavet that the \u201cassignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed \u2018racial\u2019 category\u201d is extremely relevant, it should nonetheless be stressed that there is some degree of interaction between systematic human variation and socially defined racial categories, and that certain racial classifications may be more \u201caccurate\u201d in the sense of reflecting genuine morphological differences within populations. The more interesting question is thus to what degree these racial classifications, whether scientific or social, are good guides to human biological variation. Scientists like Rosenberg have made this argument explicit, claiming in the negative that \u201carguments about the existence or non-existence of \u2018biological races\u2019 in the absence of a specific context are largely orthogonal to the question of scientific utility.\u201d But one could also say similar things about the species concept, which itself suffers from issues of imprecision and arbitrary definition. It remains an open question.<br><br>Various individuals in this thread have pointed out some of the enduring sociological questions about race which remain interesting and important- such as the degree to which folk categories correspond with biological clusters at various grains of analysis, the changing nature of socially shared racial classifications, the particular markers which are selected as salient or decisive in social discussions of race, and so on. But to suggest, or to teach, that the concept of race is \u201cjust\u201d a social concept \u2013 or, in other words, that it is biologically meaningless, is, I think, a little disingenuous in light of ongoing debates in genetics, population studies, medicine, philosophy, etc. It also tends to foreclose some of the more important contributions social scientists can make to biological studies- such as an analysis of the social/historical variables which contribute to genetic differences in particular groups. By all means we should avoid the pitfalls of a basic, unreflexive racial naturalism, but at the same time we shouldn\u2019t fall victim to an equally simplistic version of social constructionism which blithely avoids any discussion of genetic differentiation and its consequences. <br><br>**Some References<colon>**<br><br>Hochmann, A (2013) \u201cRacial Discrimination<colon> How not to do it,\u201d Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C<colon> Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 44<colon>3, 278-268.<br><br>Rosenberg NA, et al.

This is the aspect of social awkwardness I<sq>m going to discuss.  You<sq>re asking a very broad question so I will paint in broad strokes, in part because as far as I can tell there<sq>s very little research directly addressing your question.<br><br>Things are awkward when you violate the norms, someone else violates the norms, or you<sq>re worried that norms are going to be immanently be violated.  Think of why there<sq>s so much awkwardness around discussing race in America (there<sq>s even a sociological article about teaching race called <dq>the Awkward Question<dq>).  Over the past half century or so, the norms governing race and discussions of race have been rapidly changing.  Further, these behavioral expectations can vary greatly between people and what constitutions a violation of these norms also clearly varies between people--<dq>racism<dq> and <dq>political correctness<dq> are both seen, to some degree, as violations of the appropriate norms of discussing race (perceiving some thing political correctness is in some way the perceiving that the <dq>wrong norms<dq> are being socially enforced). Therefore, people may be reluctant to discuss the topic entirely because people feel as if they don<sq>t understand the norms around it and, because they don<sq>t understand the norms, they are worried about inadvertently violating a norm. Awkward romantic conversations are similar<colon> each actor (presumably) has a clear idea of the interactional order they<sq>d prefer, but neither actor knows the other<sq>s preferences.  Hence, awkwardness until this interactional ambiguity is resolved (<dq>Do you, uhhhh, like me to?<dq>) and the situation can remain awkward if the two actors<sq> interaction expectations remain different (<dq>I really think of you more as a friend<dq>).  Here, a lot of the awkwardness comes from fear of violating social rules that are up in the air.<br><br>The awkwardness associated with Asperger Syndrome, on the other hand, has to do with individuals<sq> not being able to read social cues, and therefore inadvertently and unknowingly violating social behavioral norms.  This is a rather different sort of awkwardness than the unknown norms around discussing race and romance, but comes from the same place<colon> the violation of norms (here the actual violation of norms, rather than fear over violating norms but you can see how they both interact).<br><br>To give a small counterpoint, Shamus Khan<sq>s recent book about social capital in a prep school, *Privilege*, emphasizes that opposite<colon> one of the things the prep school teaches students (both in and out of the classroom) is to all ways be <dq>at ease<dq>.  According to Khan, they are to taught to behave as if they *always* know the social norms (<dq>whether discussing Beowulf or Jaws<dq>) and therefore, in many ways, are able to set the interactional norms and gloss over violations of norms.  <br><br>The question of where norms comes from is a huge one.  At one level, many are *functional*.  That is, they serve a clear purpose in society (there are arguments about whether even some norm breaking is functional<colon> there<sq>s a classic article called <dq>Functions of Crime<colon> A Paradoxical Process<dq>).  A lot of norms have been codified into law (which side of the road we drive on) and are enforced by police, but for example waiting in line, not talking too loudly in a restaurant, etc. are mostly enforced through informal means (stares, hushes, etc., though they can also be enforced by local non-state like shop clerks, etc).  Many norms, and in particular the details of norms, seem arbitrary.  There have been many studies of personal space, for example, that have found that norms vary hugely by region and country.  Everywhere has a greeting, which serves a clear function, but the details of these greetings are arbitrary.  Some may bow, some may wave.  But in our discussion, it doesn<sq>t really matter where specific norms come from, whether they<sq>re arbitrary or functional--they<sq>re simply norms, and they<sq>re expected to be obeyed.<br><br>In the 1960<sq>s and 1970<sq>s, ethnomethodologists ([Wiki](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnomethodology)) like Harold Garfinkel ([Wiki](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Garfinkel)) did what they called <dq>breaching experiments<dq> ([wiki](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaching_experiment)) to uncover these norms.  Social psychologists picked up on this, particularly the later work of Stanley Milgrim ([Wiki](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Milgram)).   They did this by creating what you might call socially awkward situations.  This is perhaps the research most directly relevant to social awkwardness.<br><br>In these breaching experiments, a researcher would feign ignorance of social norms.  They might go into a supermarket and try to haggle over the prices.  Or ask someone on the subway for their seat without giving a reason.   One popular homework assignment was to have students go home to their parents and behave like a tenant rather than a family member (that is, act in accordance with the norms of completely different social role). This created, as you can imagine, awkward situations--both for the inadvertent subjects (you unfortunately couldn<sq>t do much this research today because of rules around <dq>informed consent<dq> about research subjects)  and the researchers themselves, who obviously have only pretended to be ignorant of the social rules.  While most of the research is concerned with the sort of group awkwardness (other<sq>s perceiving the researcher<sq>s behavior as deviant and therefore perceiving the situation as awkward) rather than the individual awkwardness you may be more interested (individuals perceiving their own behavior as violating norms, and rather themselves as awkward), I remember particularly the accounts of the subway experiment (Milgram<sq>s, I believe) and the researchers (Milgram<sq>s or Garfinkel<sq>s graduate students) talking about how, after they had gotten their seats from a stranger, they felt incredibly awkward just sitting there and felt like everyone was looking at them.  Knowing that they violated the norms, even when no one was actually sanctioning their behavior and they <dq>got away with it<dq>, made them feel not just guilt but awkwardness.<br><br>Desire to fit in with local norms informs a lot of behavior--even when the apparent norms make no sense to the actor.  There are famous social psychological experiments where, for example, everyone will be facing the wrong way in an elevator, and a person getting on will eventually face the way everyone else is facing (sometimes after a period of obvious confusion and social discomfort).  I think that was a Milgram experiment, as well.<br><br>The failure to follow social norms can result in stigma (Erving Goffman wrote the classic book on this in sociology).  In Goffman<sq>s dramaturgical model, a person is stigmatized if the other actors in the <dq>interactional order<dq> don<sq>t respond to them in the normal way and they are, thus, not treated as a real person in the interaction.  An example Goffman give is someone without a nose.  Perhaps, you would argue, that an introverted person in America is treated the same way--that in the interactional order they are not treated like a full person, and thus, the stigma of introversion has a substantial effect on interaction.  Maybe you could argue that this doesn<sq>t happen the same way in Japan.  <br><br>I<sq>m not sure of this.  Japan and the U.S. certainly have different social norms and different stigmatized behaviors.  But I find that people often try to essentialize these differences in way that tell more about the viewer than about the society they<sq>re looking at.  You might want to look at a [longer discussion idea on whether the West is <dq>individual<dq> and the East is <dq>collective<dq> here](https<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40sp92/why_is_there_a_strong_history_of_collectivist/cywwdxm).  <br><br>Japanese and American interactional norms are different (just as Indian, British, and Scandinavian norms for standing in lines are all different) but I<sq>m not sure that an American introvert would naturally fit into the Japanese interactional order--after all, there are a lot of basic norms.  I know this was from my field work abroad where friends have told me, <dq>Bro, you<sq>re foreign so you get a pass, but you *really* shouldn<sq>t do that.<dq>  The *savoir faire* of a social field is often called <dq>social capital<dq>, but that<sq>s another issue and a slightly more complicated one (indeed, introverts in some ways show the limits of the social capital model since they by rights ought to *have* the same social capital but, for various reasons, do not/cannot draw on the cultural capital in the interactional order in the same way).  </p>",

It takes a broader view, looking at Islamic youth culture and music, and US cultural influences. The  attraction of Islam to African Americans beginning early in the twentieth century is discussed, expanding with the rise of the  Nation of Islam, and intensifying with the conversion of many important jazz musicians to Islam in the 1950s and \u201860s. Aidi emphasizes how Islam offered an identity for people of African descent in the Americas that promised to transcend the worlds of slavery and segregation, linking diasporic Africans to a new spiritual and cultural genealogy.  <br>One of Aidi<sq>s main points about the current situation of European Muslims directly relates to your question<colon><br><br>> But there is also a movement westwards, toward the Black Atlantic, and the cultures and movements of the African diaspora. An American dream exists in Europe<sq>s Muslim ghettos and it<sq>s very much a black American one. For these young Europeans, America is home to African-American Islam, the oldest Muslim presence in the West, the Islam of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, an Islam that played a critical role in the civil rights movement and in making America more at ease with diversity than Europe. And whether through actual migration or virtually \u2013 through the Internet and social media \u2013 Muslim youth are reaching across the Atlantic to draw on the black freedom movement and the Islam of the African-descant communities of the New World.<br><br>Hip Hop (and music generally) could be added here as another medium of transcultural contact.

In addition, among the transient subsample, being White, more reliant on peers for help, more transient, and having been victimized were associated with high use of these survival behaviors.<br><br>In this case this study was looking specifically at homeless young adults, but you can see some of the other factors associated with this population (which is also engaged in panhandling)<colon> unemployed, relying on peers (so likely not family), and having been victimized.<br><br>Based on this, and from my own experiences working with a population that engages in panhandling, often as an outreach worker, I would offer the following tips<colon>  <br>* Remember that these are PEOPLE, and quite often people who have had or are having a tough time. I sometimes see people being verbally abusive to people who are panhandling and then those verbally abusive people get to go home to their stocked kitchens, soft beds, and safe apartments. Just remember the person you<sq>re dealing with often doesn<sq>t have that.  <br>* Make eye contact. Even if you won<sq>t do anything, making eye contact acknowledges to the person that you see them. This is huge.  <br>* If you can<sq>t give, say something. Say hello, say sorry, say good luck. Again, you<sq>re engaging with them as a fellow human being.  <br>* If you do choose to give them money, acknowledge for yourself that you are just giving a person money and that what they choose to do with it is their decision. Yeah, it might be drugs, but maybe they need those drugs to stop the pain of withdrawal, or stay awake through the night because they can<sq>t get into a shelter, or it<sq>ll help them keep warm for the night. They also might totally use the money you gave them for shelter, or food, or bills, or medications. Or for making a phone call home. Or for getting new ID made. If someone is panhandling, they are in a tough spot and there<sq>s all kinds of things that money is for.  <br>* Consider being more likely to give money to female panhandlers. A lot of shelters and soup kitchens are predominantly male spaces and a lot of the time (at least where I live) women don<sq>t feel safe in those spaces and would rather panhandle for $10 for a bed somewhere than go to a free one. Personally, I<sq>m way more likely to give larger amounts of cash to women.  <br>* The best thing you can do?<colon> Ask the panhandler themselves what they need. I do this a lot at the 7-11 near my house - there are often people in a tough spot in life who hang out out front and I just ask them as I go in, <dq>Can I get you anything?<dq> Things I<sq>ve been asked for include candy, slurpee, cigarettes, and milk. Milk surprisingly often, because the fat in it helps folks with nutritional deficiencies keep their weight up. You can use this approach in any area where there are food or retail spaces around.<br><br>I hope this helps to answer your question!</p>",

(One article had two corresponding authors, one with US and one with international affiliations; I categorized it in the international group.)<br><br>While there<sq>s a slight US bias there, I don<sq>t think it rises to an immediate level of <dq>the US is subsidizing the world.<dq> If I had more time and/or coffee, I<sq>d do a similar comparison for *Science* or *Nature* to see if that ratio is typical for English-language scientific articles.<br><br>A valid critique of my technique is that I<sq>m not necessarily sampling industry-relevant research for drug development, and that<sq>s potentially valid.  I don<sq>t have the scientific background required to assess what is plausibly good <dq>drug research<dq> and what isn<sq>t, so I<sq>m relying on *Cell* to make that judgement of quality for me (in its publication criteria).<br><br>More direct measures of drug development may also be influenced by other factors.  For example, <dq>countries where patents are first filed<dq> will be affected by patent regulations, and nations have differing standards over what is a patentable difference in the first place.  Likewise, locations of clinical trials will be affected in large part by regulations on the conduct of said trials, making it hard to tease out influence from general medical policy.<br><br>Finally, the implication of your professor<sq>s statement is that cuts to US medical costs come directly from drug development budgets.  *Even if that were true*, that is not necessarily an argument against health care reform.  Medical insurance companies, for example, make profits from the current climate, but these companies are not known for their medical research arms.  The currently-implemented health care reform in the United States takes (rough) aim at the insurance industry, and it specifically did not include measures to reduce the cost of drugs (namely Medicare negotiation of prices).<br><br>Also philosophically, drug companies do not necessarily conduct research that would provide the greatest benefit, only the most profitable.  Pfizer<sq>s financial reports, for example, were littered with warnings about the revenue impacts of the soon-expiring patent protection (internationally) of Lipitor, a massively profitable cholesterol drug for the company.  The suggestion that drug companies should be responsible for most research also carries the implication that the interests of drug companies<sq> profitability align with the worldwide social interest, which is very much a matter of debate.<br><br>[1] -- While I hoped to get some measure of article popularity/impact from this, it looks instead like it just brought up articles from mostly the 1 August issue, since newer articles are more likely to have been read in the past time-frame-used-by-the-site.<br><br>[2] -- I could have chosen <dq>first author<dq>, and the results would have been largely the same.

Some have deep roots in the communities where the live, and they are unlikely to migrate, unless they have other family roots somewhere.  Others are temporarily homeless and have a reason not to migrate, like the seasonal job they were laid off from will hire them back when the temperature rises.  Other homeless people are rootless, and they will readily migrate at the rumors of a job, or sometimes because a drug supply dries up, or other reasons.  Other homeless people are in a perpetual state of travel for decades.  They might go to Seattle or Portland every summer, and then to Southern California, Arizona, or New Orleans every winter. They might have a regular annual route, or they might wander aimlessly.  They might meet a significant other and alter their plans.  They might make annual pilgrimages to wherever their families are.  Some people, as an illustration, might work summers in Alaska, return to Los Angeles with pockets full of money, party it away and end up on the streets.  The solution to the problem is to return to Alaska, make more money, and repeat the disaster.  I have known lots of teenage gutter punks who have a regular route among a somewhat large community of people.  When one departs Seattle in December, she might say to another one, <dq>See you in Hollywood.<dq>  Members of her community are sure to show up there eventually.  They will all be back in Seattle before May.  Except the ones who died or went to jail.  But you might see those again in Los Angeles next year.

Such episodes occur because monetary policy is too contractionary, causing NGDP to fall relative to the (sticky) wage level.<br><br><br>>2. There are normally forces that tend to push the economy back toward full employment.

                "answer": "<p>Classical Liberalism championed the concept of the individual as the basis of the society, and neoliberalism took this project to it\u2019s logical extreme; it recognizes the individual as the only legitimate decision maker in society, where the individual is tasked of following it\u2019s self-interest and maximising it\u2019s utilities. And in order for the individual to fulfill this function, the market is elevated above society, almost totally out of it\u2019s reach; the market, alone and unimpeded, should be the deciding factor in who gets what and how. However, despite all of the options the market provides to us to fulfill our alleged \u2018nature\u2019 to be the self-made individuals we supposedly are, people are still unhappy and perhaps even more so today. Renata Salecl (2008), philosopher and sociologist, set out to explore this questions precisely<colon><br>>How is it that in the developed world the apparent increase of choices through which people can supposedly fashion and tailor their lives does not lead to more satisfaction, but rather contributes to greater anxiety, greater feelings of inadequacy, and guilt? (p. 159)<br><br>One of the major problems, Salecl shows, of this idea of rational choice to maximise our utilities is that choice is inherently a social act. We wonder if we made the right choices in relation to our neighbours, our friends, our fellow citizens.  This ideal economic actor should autonomously and individually get all the right and best information on where to invest their time, money, and so on, however this is never the case. We often make choices in relation to what others have chosen around us, how we think others will perceive us for making the choice, and in relation to the authorities in society, otherwise known as the Big Other (2008, p. 165). In this sense, making choice a massive part of our lives and an entire ordeal in and of itself in society, people are led to feel less satisfied and more anxious. And this leads individuals, almost inexorably, to spend far more time making these choices that are so valued instead of engaging in other activities, such as building solidarity, fighting injustice, and so on.<br><br>Above and beyond Salecl\u2019s work on choice in society, there is Barry Schwartz\u2019s book The Paradox of Choice published in 2004. Schwartz is trying to find a link between happiness and increased choice options in the US but instead finds that as choice options and freedom of choice increases, so does the dissatisfaction and unhappiness of those societies. Schwartz uses 4 psychological models to explore precisely why choices are so psychologically unfulfilling<colon> (1) choice and happiness; (2) freedom or commitment; (3) second-order decisions; and (4) missed opportunities. Firstly, the increases in choice has lead to the erosion of social relations whereby this social fabric, which were a given in previous eras, is now a matter of choice, insofar as it has become a \u201cseries of deliberate and demanding choices\u201d (p. 110). Individuals have to make their own friends now instead of them being a given from the workplace, the neighbourhood, and so on. This leads to the increase in loneliness and isolation many Americans report today. Secondly, related to these social relations which fulfill us, they also constrain us and, in a way, trap us when we are dissatisfied with them. Schwartz here is arguing that it is precisely the lack of constraints that our social and political realms put on us actually make increase our unhappiness since the rules of the game are unclear, as opposed to social relationships, where you can\u2019t just throw them away. Thirdly and furthermore, second-order decisions are, in some cases, effectively rules that make some of life\u2019s decisions for us. And finally, but certainly not least of all, are missed opportunities. Each new option complicates an already difficult decision making process, and with each additional option, the least satisfied we get with the one we chose (p. 130). Schwartz here is talking about a kind of \u2018buyers remorse\u2019, where once we make a choice, we immediately begin to imagine our lives with another option that was not chosen and feel as though we didn\u2019t make the right or the best choice; that somehow if we picked option Y instead of option X we\u2019d be so much happier, furthering the negative experience of life at all subsequent levels.<br><br>Is this the only frame or perspective through which to interpret this problem? Of course not. But this line of thought definitely has some interesting political implications.<br><br>---<br><br>* Salecl, R. (2009). Society of choice.

                "answer": "<p>A bit of background on the history of Latin America might help understand this.<br><br>* When the Spaniards arrived, they came not as settlers so much as conquerors, or *conquistadores*. The goal was not to settle new lands but to extract gold and resources from local populations. English conquerors also tried this at first, but being relegated to higher latitudes, they found few developed agrarian societies to conquer, so they turned to colonization instead. Whereas when the Spanish arrived, they basically replaced the ruling caste. The viceroy of Peru even employed the *mita*, an Incan tradition, to provide labor for the silver mines. This created an extractive feudal society where power is permanently held by a small group of people ruling over large masses of indigenous peasants. <br><br>* Spanish colonies followed a rigid racial social structure, with *peninsulares* (peninsulars, i.e. spaniards) holding important political posts and being appointed directly from Spain. Next came the *criollos*, white europeans who had significant ties to the motherland but who were born and raised in the Americas. They formed an upper class tightly bound to European elites, who owned and managed most of the economy. Next came the middle class *mestizos*, who were often of mixed race but held on to Spanish identity, names and customs enough to be considered *people*. <br><br>* Finally, the indigenous population, who were considered little better than slaves, were often paid in specie and were not allowed to leave the land they worked on, often being sold as part of the property among European landholders, or *hacendistas*. The catholic church was an early critic of these slavery-like practices, so a bargain was struck with the church. Landowners recognized that these natives were people with basic rights and promised to help the church deliver them to god to save their souls. In return for their eternal salvation, natives were bound to the land and service of a landholder. <br><br>* Politics and religion aren<sq>t easily separated in Latin America. The church<sq>s complicity in the combination of social disintegration, alcoholism, disease and overworking that led to the decline and abuse of many deeply impoverished indigenous communities laid the seeds of what would eventually become *liberation theology*, where elements within the catholic church rebelled against the powers-that-be. The New Testament<sq>s message of social justice became an inspiration for social change. As archbishop H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara eloquently once said<colon> *<dq>When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.\u201d*  <br><br>* Even though the wars for independence were fought by many who believed in creating a new country inspired by the ideals of the enlightment, the french revolution and most of all, the ideals of equality recently enshrined in the constitution of the United States, most of the Criollo ruling elite only wanted to achieve political independence from Spain, freeing themselves from the yoke of *peninsulares*. This was not a courtesy they intended to extend to lower rungs of society. They had little interest in changing the social and economic structure of their nations and any attempts to do so were quickly squashed once independence was achieved. So the Criollos continued holding the vast majority of land and political power. <br><br>* These enormous concentrations of land and resources in the hands of small elites are thought to have retarded economic development as landholders, like their Spanish predecessors, were content to extract a surplus while seeing little reason to innovate since exercizing absolute control over political institutions shielded them from competition. As this control starts to erode, agricultural reforms to grant ownership to those who worked the land and providing market incentives to develop agriculture became enormously important political battles in the 20th century. In many countries these battles ended in revolution, which were often violently squashed by conservative elements in the army, often supported by the United States, a country that had once stood as an inspiration for emancipation. Eventually though, even these military strongmen that succeeded oligarchic governments saw the necessity of reforming land ownership.<br><br>* This process is not finished. Many of the most unequal countries in the world today are in Latin america, even after many have achieve middle-income status. Even if land is no longer the main point of content, this long history of entrenched social and economic inequality provided (and still provides) a fertile growing ground for Marxist thinking, that itself emerged in a similar situation a century earlier in the exploited laborer neighborhoods of industrial-era Europe.<br><br>Source<colon><br><br>*- Acemoglu, Daron, and James A.

The Stone Wall Riots can better be viewed as the straw that broke the camel<sq>s back. There is an excellent documentary called <dq>Before Stonewall<dq> which takes interviews from early LGB activists and paints a picture of life in the McCarthyism-era. During the red scare, homosexual people were accused of being spies because they were viewed as easy to blackmail. Many were fired and persecuted, which ironically created conditions that would make them easy to blackmail. Some LGB peoples protested. This early protest movement was centered on looking as <dq>normal<dq> (read<colon> heteronormative) as possible. Women wore skirts, men suits, and protested in picket lines for their right to work. This early movement drew on 1960s youth culture, Vietnam protests, the Civil Right<sq>s movement of black Americans, and the women<sq>s movement. They used the skills these other movements had mastered to fight their own battles<colon> skills like mustering <dq>the grassroots.<dq><br><br>It is true that homosexual people were not always oppressed in the same way they are today. I would suggest checking out D<sq>Emilio and Freedman<sq>s *Intimate Matters*, which details the history of sexuality in America. They tell many stories of women and men engaging in acts we would deem homosexual without persecution. <br><br>The modern LGB and T rights movement primarily centers around marriage. Even in the case of work-place rights and general acceptance, many battles are fought around marriage rights. For many, Proposition 8 was the first big shout from the LGBT movement about equal marriage, however marriage was first made legal in Hawaii, which was later revoked under fears of becoming a <dq>gay mecca<dq> and people were applying for same-sex marriage licenses as early as 1971 according to Michael Klarman (*From the Closet to the Altar<colon> Courts, Backlash, and the Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage*). After Prop 8 we saw a tide of changes towards equal marriage across America (Klarman). <br><br>In general, the LGB (sometimes T) movement draws on protest movements growing from the 1960s and 70s. Although marriage has become the primary battle ground, the early movement did not know whether or not to fight for what we would call equal marriage. Many wished instead to change the institution of marriage, or to not <dq>give in to<dq> the heterosexual marriage ideal (Klarman). <br><br>Today, we see that grassroots organizations are key in winning the big fight for marriage. Consider the recent battled in Minnesota for equal marriage. I conducted some original research on this fights. Rhetoric around equal marriage claimed that they only way to win against an amendment that would shut down equal marriage for at least two election years was through grassroots effort. Even if other forces are at work (e.g. large donors, politicians), grassroots effort is viewed as The Thing that drives the LGB movement. Grassroots movement can also be interpreted as direct voter contact. Amy Stone emphasizes the need for direct voter contact in her book *Gay Rights at the Ballot Box*. This type of contact is believed to have been the winning strategy employed by Minnesotans United for All Families to shoot down the marriage amendment. Later, equal marriage was passed through the house and senate. However, this is all very recent and it is difficult for me to point to specific research on this particular movement. Suffice to say that grassroots movement is, at the very least, viewed as essential to the success of the LGB movement at large. <br><br>Stealth edit<colon> I should mention that most of this refers to the modern LGB movement in the United States of America. Other movements may draw on this, but will have differences.</p>",

This solidarity and sense of community was something gay people never had before, and it would prove to be the empowerment they needed to finally stand up, speak up and come out. <br><br>Homosexuality was actually fine in most cultures until around 300AD or so when religion (and later imperialism) came along and stirred up a frenzy; all homophobia as we know it today is rooted in religion and if religion didn<sq>t suppress study into the subject as well as enact a campaign of oppression and demonization then it could be argued the concept of homophobia (and equality of rights and respect for gay people) as we know it today would be absolutely non existent and we<sq>d have societies which are much better educated about the phenomenon as apposed to our current situation which is essentially an intellectually stunted society on every level in regards to this subject. <br><br>You often hear people say <dq>everyone in Africa or Asia has probably always hated gays<dq> but this is far from the truth; it wasn<sq>t until we British came along with our civilized moral values and religion and imposed our homophobia onto these societies did anti-gay sentiment take root, which is ironic considering politicians in Africa and India actually claim homosexuality is the western important as apposed to homophobia!<br><br>This anti-gay sentiment went full steam ahead during the Victorian Era because of opinions surrounding sex and <dq>cleanliness<dq>; homosexuality was inevitably sucked into it. It was this Victorian Era flourishing of pure hatred which continued into the 20th century and basically produced the venomously homophobic western societies we all know and love today; where homosexuality is seen as somewhat <dq>dirty<dq> but you<sq>re not sure why and religion has ensured a plethora of unsavory myths and lies are still being spread without any education to dispel them and no alternative narratives to counter all the negativity. <br><br>Homosexuality still not being included in sex education, biology or evolution in school ensures lots of false assumptions and misconceptions remain because kids are told <dq>All purpose of life is to reproduce<dq> without being told how gay people fit into the picture as well as a host of other things which leads them to jump to conclusions and assumptions which aren<sq>t in line with current expert theory or study. <br><br>In addition to the total lack of education and understanding throughout history, they have been indoctrinated and brainwashed into a very intense hatred and fear of LGBT people with all sorts of lies and myths and this conditioning adds fuel to the fire and there are virtually no alternative narratives that offer a positive or educational perspective until very very recently. It<sq>s basically been a constant hammering of BAD EW WRONG WTF for centuries with no opposition voice. People have been completely terrified of LGBT people for a variety of irrational and often humorous reasons from their children<sq>s innocence and safety to their own reputation and social status in their town in their social circle or as a parent to the very end of mankind itself through extinction or the rapture. <br><br>Additionally, people need a punching bag and a scape goat to make themselves feel secure and powerful, and gay people have always been proven to be the perfect choice because of the climate of fear, hatred and lack of understanding surrounding them combined with their small numbers as a minority, their lack of political power, and because they don<sq>t produce offspring it means they are <dq>worthless<dq> anyway and would not be missed. They gave up women, they gave up black people and other racial minorities, but they will fight to the death before they will give up their last punching bag. What we are seeing recently is a lot of bigots screaming and crying about losing their punching bags due to <dq>Political Correctness<dq> or <dq>Liberal Agendas<dq>; because everyone has always hated gay people like they do, they are absolutely fuming society has done such a sudden 180 and many haven<sq>t even acknowledged most people aren<sq>t hateful like them anymore. Their tears are delicious. <br><br>It could be argued if religion and imperialism didn<sq>t throw a spanner in the works the idea of disliking someone because they are gay would be as baffling as disliking somebody because they have green eyes and the concept of homophobia as we know it would never have been stirred up. It could be argued the colossal fuck up that is humans understanding of homosexuality would never have happened and the resulting campaign of intense hatred and all the lies and stigma that came with it would be unimaginable. Religion and imperialism (In India and Africa for example) are the root cause of all homophobia as we know it without which there would never have been a need for <dq>gay rights<dq> because we already would have them. Every anti-gay assumption or misconception you hear these days from <dq>gays are wrong because it<sq>s un-natural<dq> to <dq>gays are wrong because there<sq>s no baby at the end<dq> would have been dispelled a long, long time ago. <br><br>Now, because minorities have been proven to internalize and manifest all the nasty things propagated about them no matter how false it may be, it wasn<sq>t until the removal of homosexuality from the mental health register combined with the anti-establishment, pro-civil rights <dq>fuck the police<dq> climate of the 60s and their still new sense of community and solidarity before LGBT people had the courage to stand up for themselves and try to put an end to this 1700 year long campaign of totally unjustified oppression and demonization by battering the police persecuting them which absolutely shocked the world because NOBODY beat the police; not the suffragettes, not the black panthers, not the anti-war movement, nobody. Nobody beat the police and then all of a sudden the QUEERS of all people totally fucked them up; it was truly revolutionary and sent shock waves around the globe.  <br><br>What you need to understand is Stonewall can be seen as the straw that broke the camels back and was actually *1700 years* in the making. Stonewall was the inevitable boiling over of a pot which had been brewing for centuries. Stonewall can be described as the defining moment where gays grew a back bone and said NO MORE. This caused a tidal wave of inspiration and empowerment which quickly spread to other countries in the west as well as the massive campaign to <dq>come out<dq> in the 70s. This got the ball rolling (very slowly) towards the much more tolerant society we live in today. <br><br>One crucial point to remember is that the *only reason* I haven<sq>t been killed yet and snatched off the streets of England and slaughtered as a gay man is because of the blood, sweat and tears sacrificed by gay people who came before me since 1969. It<sq>s been a very gradual process, until acceptance surged at the turn of the century (which I will explain at the end)<br><br>To this day we are still absolute door mats and live under terrorism and apartheid in many different ways and there is still very little security in ourselves so many, many LGBT people are frightened to stand up for themselves or speak out or fight for their rights, and nobody is scared of gay people like they are of black people; we are still seen as weak, inferior, mentally disabled and apparently totally worthless easy targets which makes it much harder to gain respect and security. <br><br>The crushing pressure to conform to heterosexual standards and expectations as well as the pressure to become totally invisible and most importantly keep your mouth firmly *zipped* means there aren<sq>t many people who are brave enough to speak out, and those who <dq>rock the boat<dq> are seen as trouble makers who put all gay people at risk by extension and so LGBT people often learn to police and oppress themselves. It is very similar to the situation of black people in the 1950s and 1960s I think<colon> it<sq>s much easier to shuffle to the back of the bus instead of inconveniencing the white passengers by standing up for yourself. Standing up for yourself means you are putting all black people at risk of violent repercussion, so black people would prefer you to not cause a fuss. This means progress can be very slow and combined with the internalized feeling of being <dq>second class<dq> or <dq>sub human<dq> you basically agree with the oppression and so you take whatever shit is flung your way because on some level you feel it is deserved and just; <dq>I got beaten to a pulp, but it serves me right for going out dressed flamboyantly and flaunting it<dq>, <dq>I was made homeless by my family, but it serves me right for not keeping my sexuality in the closet where it belongs<dq>; <dq>Me and my boyfriend were spat on, but it serves us right for holding hands in public and not keeping it in the bedroom where it belongs<dq> etc. <br><br>Upon the realization that being gay is a genetic and inborn thing and not a mental quirk picked up along the way through bad parenting as previously thought, this has dramatically shifted people<sq>s perceptions of gay people and because they think <dq>It could have been me<dq> more people care about LGBT rights now because even though actual education and understanding has remained stagnant there is a lot more **empathy** and **compassion** because of this, and the fact people are born gay and not made and because they know they are gay from a very young age, this has dramatically increased the demand for a safe, supportive environment because they are seen as innocent kids as apposed to mentally deranged adult fetishists as they were previously perceived. <br><br>In fact everything I do in regards to LGBT rights is never for me; I am thinking of the gay kids who are suffering always. I am always working to make society a bit better for the next generation of gay kids like those before me have done. I<sq>d argue that is why gay rights have become so important; because we want to create a better world for the next generation of gay kids who are inevitable whereas previously we thought they had to be made that way. Every day a kid realizes he is gay and is tossed into a dark pit of despair, so every day we work hard to abolish the pit. It<sq>s a constant race against time and a matter of life and death for a good chunk of our populations which is why it is so important to me and others. Most people these days simply say they <dq>Don<sq>t give a shit<dq> and while that<sq>s good in the sense they aren<sq>t haters, it<sq>s bad because it means they are essential fence sitters and don<sq>t actually help push progress like they think they do. Sorry guys, simply saying <dq>I have no problem with gays<dq> doesn<sq>t mean you are an ally who is helping society progress, you have to do more than that I<sq>m afraid. Since a lot of gay people are too afraid to speak out because it puts them at risk and are such a small minority, we really do rely heavily on the voices of our heterosexual allies. Heterosexuals don<sq>t listen to me when I speak out against homophobia or for LGBT rights because duh I<sq>m gay and I<sq>m just a whining drama queen who is looking for reasons to be offended. Heterosexuals listen to other heterosexuals though and your word is (sadly) worth more than mine in this regard so for the love of god, use it. <br><br>So what we have seen since gay people started <dq>coming out<dq> in the late 60s after the Stonewall uprising is not an increase of <dq>acceptance<dq> and <dq>understanding<dq> but is actually an increase of *tolerance* and *empathy*, despite the general public<sq>s fundamental understanding and education remaining static since the 1960s with the exception of the <dq>Is it a choice<dq> question finally being settled. I think this increase of tolerance is mainly because people learned after all the gays <dq>came out<dq> that the scary gay man wasn<sq>t actually a demon lurking in the shadows trying to eat their babies but was their sons, sisters, friends, co-workers; their loved ones. <br><br>Also people simply don<sq>t care that someone might be gay like they used to as it<sq>s not seen as such a big deal in our sexually liberal socieites, especially now that society is more accommodating to them. Remember, gay people break a lot, if not all of societies unwritten rules in regards to what men and women should look like, what men and women should act like and what men and women should do such as get married, have kids etc. so when they came out in the 60s it was always going to be a long struggle to change the infrastructures and deep rooted traditions, expectations and gender roles of our societies that were 2000 years in the making to accommodate them. <br><br>When gay people came out in the 70s it was like a Drag Queen busted in on a Christmas dinner celebration they spent 2000 years cooking but had no seating or food for the Drag Queen and have had to frantically and sloppily scramble to accommodate them. <br><br>They also saw how their parents generations have oppressed and brutalized minorities like black people and gay people and want absolutely nothing to do with the disgusting sociopathic practice themselves and the fresh memory of the stomach churning oppression, hatred and misery means they are much more inclined to offer the Drag Queen a seat at their table. We are saying ENOUGH IS ENOUGH of that bullshit and being <dq>pro-gay<dq> is to make a statement saying you do not subscribe to the oppressive practices of the past and are for progression and equality and change which is also why Gay Rights has become a totally partisan political position where <dq>liberals<dq> tend to be consistently pro-gay and <dq>conservatives<dq> tend to be quite anti-gay. This <dq>divide and rule<dq> political aspect of gay rights is definitely one of the reasons we are seeing more of a focus on the media and in the public debate; things like gay rights and equal marriage offer a nice divide and conquer distraction tactic to turn the attention of the masses away from other things like institutional corruption (which just pisses me off on so many levels really because it<sq>s such bullshit) <br><br>In the 80s we suffered a serious setback with AIDS because as it was regarded as a <dq>Gay Disease<dq> and so it was used to justify the sentiment <dq>gay is wrong<dq> and it probably re-ignited those homophobic <dq>gay is dirty and diseased<dq> flairs that lay somewhat stagnant since the uprising. We also lost a lot of lives, which means there is a huge generational gap and my parents generation is missing a lot of gay people who would have been there had things been different. The high body count of gay people in the 80s also meant there were less people to help fight the cause and it allowed society to take a few steps back in regards to LGBT respect with the flourishing of hostile speak like <dq>that<sq>s so gay<dq> or <dq>fag<dq> in the school environment as well as other things. <br><br>Another crucial aspect of the rise of tolerance of LGBT people is the diminishing of strict gender roles and masculine insecurity; men especially have always been terrified of being perceived to be gay because it<sq>s social suicide as to be gay is to be <dq>fem<dq> and to be <dq>fem<dq> is to be <dq>weak<dq>. Even going to the extent of constructing the ideal of <dq>meterosexual<dq> where you can groom yourself with products, dress outlandishly and other <dq>gay<dq> stereotypes while retaining your masculine identity and thus retaining your social status as a <dq>real man<dq>. This is also why <dq>No Homo<dq> exists. The <dq>Real Men Wear Pink<dq> campaign a decade or so ago sums it up quite nicely; masculinity is now paradoxically defined by your security within your own masculinity and so men aren<sq>t as afraid of being perceived to be gay because of this in addition to the diminishing stigma surrounding actually being gay. The diminishing of the stereotype that all gay men are mega feminine means that the sexism men harbor and their desire to not be seen as <dq>fem<dq> or <dq>weak<dq> means a man being perceived to be gay is not as stressful for them. Sexism is a corner stone of homophobia and masculine insecurity is often at the root of a lot of anti-gay sentiment and bullying; the desire to appear <dq>macho<dq> and <dq>alpha<dq> combined with the desire to NOT be seen as gay which is the opposite of <dq>macho<dq> and <dq>alpha<dq> according to the 1950s standards of masculinity and <dq>gay<dq>. This explains why typical <dq>macho<dq> institutions like sport lag so far behind on gay rights and why you are only gay in certain countries if you are the bottom because that means you are the <dq>woman<dq> but if you are top you are the <dq>man<dq> and are therefore not gay. You<sq>d be surprised how much homophobia stems from sexism, masculine insecurity and strict gender roles. At this point in time sexism and masculine insecurity are probably 50/50 with religion as causes of homophobia with a good dollop of perpetual ignorance through lack of education, experience or understanding thrown in. Gay men also fall into this trap of believing being gay compromises their masculinity, so you see a LOT of gay men try to over compensate by being as stereotypically <dq>macho<dq> or <dq>alpha<dq> as possible in every other possible way. <br><br><br>So as a 22 year old, it seems to me ever since the 60s we have seen a gradual increase in acceptance which is reaching the tipping point right now; despite understanding and education of homosexuality remaining virtually non existent. This gradual increase of acceptance seems to tie in with the gradual increase of visibility and most importantly, the gradual increase of confidence and strength of gay people to hold their head up high instead of cowering in the corner or becoming invisible. These aspects combined with heterosexuals new found empathy and increasing understanding, the realization gay people are born and not made, and the desire to break out of oppressive traditions of the past can all be combined to provide a solid explanation for the surge of attention given to LGBT rights compared to previous generations.<br><br>With every new generation, gay kids grow up in a slightly more friendly environment and so take less and less shit. Gay people from the 60s would have tolerated shit gay people from the 80s would not, and gay people in the 80s tolerated shit that I would not. <br><br>My generation especially do not tolerate any bullshit, and I actually coined a term <dq>Know Your Place Gays<dq> to distinguish between people who I can only describe as people who have internalized the idea they are second class or sub human and value the convenience of heterosexuals over their own fundamental rights. <dq>Know Your Place Gays<dq> are people who are so desperate to be accepted by the cool kids they emulate them in every way, even down to their anti-gay opinions. They are people who are desperate to fit in, or people who have internalized and manifested all the nasty shit they<sq>ve heard to the point they lick the boots of their oppressors. We have seen gay people be the most pathetic door mats in the past, we have seen them lick the boots of their oppressors in their pathetic desperate need for acceptance and we are breaking away from that. My generation of LGBT folk are bashing back and we are bashing back hard, without compromise. This often results in increase of respect but of course can have the opposite effect with the wrong person and cause a violent push back like we saw with the Civil Rights movement and the KKK, lynching etc. which I think we are starting to see now which is scary but ultimately it will prove to be the death rattle of a homophobic past so bring it on cunt nuggets. <br><br>The internet has proven to be absolutely revolutionary when it comes to advancing gay rights since forums and websites that allow communal discussion became possible during the turn of the century; it allowed discussion and education that is otherwise impossible to take place **on a global platform**. I have started many discussions on many websites over the past 10 years or so on LGBT rights and homosexuality, and have worked hard to share information and give people that fundamental education and understanding they were denied in school. Myths are easily dispelled, and age old lies crumble in the face of concrete facts that are undeniable. <br><br>This discussion and information means people<sq>s understanding of homosexuality with anyone who makes use of these resources sky rockets, and the internet as well as media like Hollywood or TV has given heterosexuals a much needed injection of empathy to boot. <br><br>Additionally, during debate on LGBT rights or homosexuality online I can dispel myths, lies and slander with sources and studies that **prove** the homophobe is wrong; this is difficult to achieve outside of the internet. Before the internet it was always like <dq>Well everyone has an opinion and it<sq>s just a big mystery<dq> but since the creation of the internet we can actually find information and education and use those sources to prove outright whether something is true or false. It means I can stand up and say YOU ARE WRONG and I can PROVE IT in front of the whole world.<br><br>For me it<sq>s no coincidence that the unprecedented surge of LGBT acceptance over the past 15 years or so aligns with the rise of internet based communication, educational resources, online forums and social media. This is why acceptance and understanding of LGBT people has flourished since the turn of the century; good old internet. I couldn<sq>t walk up to my brother and spout off this wall of text and expect him to listen; the intrinsic nature of the style of communication in the internet allows me to articulate my thoughts, feelings and opinions and be **listened to for once**, this is simply impossible through other mediums. <br><br>So because understanding of homosexuality and LGBT people has been revolutionized thanks to the internet, and because the younger (internet using) generations of heterosexuals have plenty of gay friends, family and role models and are armed with a much better understanding, and because the younger (internet using) gay people have confidence and security within themselves that they never had previously, gay rights have been pushed into the forefront of our consciousness because more people actually care to speak out either for themselves or on behalf of their gay friend or family member who they love. <br><br>Whereas straight people used to say <dq>Okay<dq> or <dq>Don<sq>t care not my problem<dq> they are now screaming <dq>NO!<dq> and whereas gay people used to say <dq>Okay<dq> or <dq>I deserve it<dq> they are now screaming <dq>NO!<dq> and because gay people have always been the easiest political scapegoat around and the <dq>Culture War<dq> is still being fought, we are seeing a lot of focus on gay rights right now. That<sq>s my take on it anyway. Hope I could offer some insight! Feel free to correct anything I might have gotten wrong, and if people want to get a solid understanding of how LGBT rights started and progressed I<sq>d highly recommend the Stonewall Documentary Series<colon> <dq>Before Stonewall<dq>, the <dq>Stonewall Uprising<dq>, and <dq>After Stonewall<dq>. They give you a well rounded insight into how we got here, where we came from, and where we are going.<br><br></p>",

The thing you are probably looking for is called symbolic and social boundary making. To quote my own paper \u2018Boundaries can be either symbolic or social. \u201cSymbolic boundaries are conceptual distinctions made by social actors to categorize objects, people, practices and [\u2026] time and space\u201d (Lamont / Moln\u00e1r 2002<colon> 168). This boundary-making is how people construct their environment and how groups or individuals compete for social status or resources. \u201cSocial boundaries are objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to and unequal distribution of resources [\u2026] and social opportunities\u201d (ibid.). They are, in a way, an institutionalized form of symbolic boundaries recognized by a majority of people, which restrict social interaction. Both symbolic and social boundaries are of equal importance, whereas their occurrence is a bit of a chicken-or-egg-dilemma. Symbolic boundaries at the individual level are necessary, in order to create social boundaries at the group level, but social boundaries can be superimposed by, for example, the government, then in turn causing symbolic boundaries to arise. Also, it takes more than just symbolic boundaries to create or alter social boundaries, for instance those boundaries must have a common agreed upon code for them to stick as social boundaries (ibid. 169).\u2019<br><br>So what happened to the Jews in America? They shifted and modified their boundary. The early US had only the white and non-white category. Every WASP was considered a white and everything else was non-white. To better their position Jews had to elevate themselves from being part of the non-white category to something else. That is what is called ethnic boundary making, altering boundaries by diluting the definition of certain groups, changing the defining attribute or redrawing how certain groups are defined. The Jewish communities did twofold. First they clearly cut a line between them and other \u2018non-whites\u2019 by elevating their religion, blurring the line between Christians and Jews \u2013 basically they are more the same as other religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, blurring the dividing lines between religions. Second they stressed more importance on mostly being white, thus demoting the importance of religion as a symbolic boundary. Religion isn\u2019t the most important divisor any more, being white is. <br><br>To sum this up<colon> By elevating the importance of certain things in one direction and decresing the importance of distinctions in another direction Jews managed to shift the priorities in boundary making in America.

I can<sq>t find how many are employed in the US, but it is safe to say that it is significant.  In order to know which company benefits the US most in terms of employment, we would have to know the total amount employed by Samsung, and the total amount paid in American wages.

Companies have to pay US taxes even if they are not US companies, but there are a lot of loopholes that companies use.

[Apple](https<colon>//www.thestreet.com/story/13534005/1/why-apple-stock-is-a-great-holding-for-dividend-investors.html) does pay a higher dividend yield to investors than [Samsung](http<colon>//www.samsungsdi.com/ir/stock-information/dividend-details.html), but since it is a tech company it does not have the same loyalty that companies like Pepsi or Disney have, which means lower overall stock value than the actual worth of the company.  You also have to look at the overall benefit of the world economy, because that will have a benefit on the American economy.  Since Samsung employs so many people and does a lot of charitable and environmental work, there is a great world economy benefit that allows for greater overall American exports.<br><br>In the end, it is impossible to actually calculate the benefit of purchasing either one smartphone or the other.

Unfortunately in the U.S., Black Americans live, on average, 10 years less than White Americans. This has to do with very limited access to the health care system as well as access to healthy, nutritious, and affordable food, and the added stress that almost always accompanies chronic racial disparities/ societal/structural racism (this is NOT genetic). As far as gender goes- women are typically more at risk for obesity because they are expected to rear children and rarely have the time to get good exercise and eat healthy meals for themselves. This is especially true for many Black women in America who work multiple, minimum wage paying jobs and are then expected to come home and feed the family (even if you<sq>re a single mother). Affordable healthcare and preventative health education is really lacking in the U.S.- even if you cut out racial disparities, most Americans are at risk for diabetes and obesity because of all the junk food this country has to offer (accompanied by a lack of nutrition education).

It still, on average, convincingly pays to get a bachelor<sq>s degree. <br><br>There is a <dq>sizable minority<dq>, however, for whom this is not true. This would imply that a college degree does not automatically raise a person<sq>s earning power, but that it *tends* to raise an individual<sq>s earning power, and is certainly an *opportunity* to do so if people make decisions with realistic, practical expectations. For example, the cliche of taking $120,000 in student loans to get an Education degree, where the average starting salary is $30,000-$40,000 (and stays in that range for a good while), would cripple the student<sq>s ability to start a new life as an adult. It would take them 25-30 years to pay it off, living like a poor person all the while. <br><br>It would make much more sense for some people to get an AA at a community college, go to a public University to finish their BA/BS, work part time and leave with maybe $10-15k in student loans. That amount could be paid off in 2-3 years if they lived frugally with a goal in mind to pay off their loans. <br><br>On the other hand, someone taking out even $300k in loans to become a surgeon makes sense, because surgeons make $250-$500k/year. They<sq>d in a practical sense be able to pay that back in 2-3 years. <br><br>So as odious as this is to many people, simple logic (outside of sociological concerns) dictates students would be unwise to simply study whatever and whereever they wish in our current system without counting the cost first. <br><br>The issue with rising tuition is that college does indeed help people have more income, but this opportunity is becoming less and less accessible (and more risky) to the poor and middle class. And it is reducing the relative quality of life of those who make that sacrifice of time and money to pay off high amounts of loans rather than lower amounts of loans. Many question whether that extra money is being used to actually further the quality of Education. I certainly do. </p>",

I am no expert on Likert literature, and I invite others who are to comment.  But I am reminded of a test-taking option I give to my students in economics, an approach to probability, value, and belief which bears on your question.  Suppose you are taking a multiple choice exam wherein each question offers five responses, A through E - as in the typical Likert items, where A=Strongly disagree (with a stipulated claim), E=Strongly agree (with the claim), and where the middle letters lie in between.  Now suppose the question is <dq>Do minimum wage laws hurt the U.S. economy?<dq> On multiple choice exams I give my economics students the chance to allocate what Bayesian statisticians call their <dq>degrees of belief<dq>, expressed in the form of probabilities across the five options on the scale, A through E.  For some reasons (such as price inflation and unemployment) the historical evidence from Card and Krueger<sq>s work and from others says to some (and by no means not to all!) to put a lot of weight - that is, a lot of probability - on item <dq>A, strongly disagree<dq>; minimum wages do not hurt the U.S. economy.  And yet for other reasons (such as appeals to liberty and economic <dq>deadweight loss<dq>) some might wish to allocate some of their belief (some of the probability) to <dq>E, strongly agree<dq>; yes, in some regards the minimum wage laws do hurt the economy. Thus the Likert scale might be improved (be more precise, and more attentive to effect size and actual beliefs) if there is the option for survey respondents to <sq>scale the scale<sq> so to speak - allocating a 1 or .75 or .50 or .25 or 0, for example, item by item.

I needed to learn to speak 3-4 languages over the past few years for my job, and in the process have landed on a pretty damn good method.  It got me to C1 fluency in French in about 5 months, and I<sq>m  currently using it with Russian (and plan on reaching C1 equivalent fluency by September).  At this point, I go in 4 stages<colon><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br>Stage 1<colon> Learn the correct pronunciation of the language.  Doing this does a few things \u2013  because I\u2019m first and foremost learning how to hear that language\u2019s sounds, my listening comprehension gets an immediate boost before I even start traditional language age learning.  Once I start vocabulary training, I retain it better because I\u2019m familiar with how words should sound and how they should be spelled.  (Correct spellings in French, for example, are much easier to remember when there\u2019s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don<sq>t switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.<br><br> <br>Stage 2<colon> Vocab and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages), no English allowed<br><br>I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an Anki deck and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I start putting them together.  I use Google translate and a grammar book to start making sentences, then get everything doublechecked at lang-8.com.  Turning them into fill-in-the-blank flashcards builds the initial grammar and connecting words.  As vocab and grammar grow, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list and any specific vocab you need for your specific interests.<br><br><br><br>Stage 3<colon> Listening, writing and reading work<br><br>Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, I start writing essays, watching TV shows and reading books.

So they found out that they could get people to buy more food than they needed if they offered really good deals in bulk.<br><br>For instance, McDonalds was a big player in this.

So let<sq>s say you only pay 15<percent> more for the next level, but you got about 30<percent> more food, and McDonalds makes even more profit. So most people, being rational consumers, would choose the larger option because it was such a good deal, even though there was more food than they needed.

Because of that, most of the research you will find in the field is looking for ways of fostering and directing technological innovation, or engineering behaviour change.<br><br>However, I notice that your question is not quite framed in those terms. I think that you are asking about the possibility of simply cutting down on our consumption and redistributing our resources. There is not much research on that line because there is not a feasible way of redistributing the wealth and shrinking down out utilization of resources on a global scale. There are theories about steady state economics and economic de-growth [but de-growth is generally seen as a lofty yet unattainable goal (see, for example, Kreschner 2010)] (http<colon>//www.degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Kerschner-2010.pdf)<br><br>But, again, your question is not about pursuing practical and realistic approaches, or I do not see it that way. I think that you are asking for us to engage in a thought experiment in order to explore what could be done in an ideal world where we all suddenly decided to pursue full sustainability and full equality using the technologies available today. <br><br>I think we can answer that with some back of the envelope calculations. First, we have to take a look at the ecological footprint of civilization as it stands today. Turns out that we [use the equivalent of 1.5 planets to provide the resources we use and absorb our waste.] (http<colon>//www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/gfn/page/world_footprint/). Obviously, since we only have one planet we can not sustainably use one and a half. We have to cut down our consumption by one third. Rougly speaking, global consumption and Gross World Product (the sum of the GDPs of all countries) are equivalent. In 2012, the GWP totalled approximately US$84.97 trillion in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), while the per capita GWP was approximately US$12,400.[(According to the CIA world factbook, 2013)](https<colon>//www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html). If we cut that down by one third in order to achieve a sustainable footprint, we get a ballpark answer to your question<colon> If we adjusted our consumption and perfectly redistributed our wealth, we would get $8184 a year each. (Assuming that we do not have any major technological breakthroughs, that everyone is willing to play along, and that production does not collapse as a result of de-growth and redistribution.)<br>Now, $8184 does not mean much without context. It may be useful to take a look at the [GDP per capita of several countries] (http<colon>//www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=39&pr.y=6&sy=2012&ey=2012&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=512<percent>2C668<percent>2C914<percent>2C672<percent>2C612<percent>2C946<percent>2C614<percent>2C137<percent>2C311<percent>2C962<percent>2C213<percent>2C674<percent>2C911<percent>2C676<percent>2C193<percent>2C548<percent>2C122<percent>2C556<percent>2C912<percent>2C678<percent>2C313<percent>2C181<percent>2C419<percent>2C867<percent>2C513<percent>2C682<percent>2C316<percent>2C684<percent>2C913<percent>2C273<percent>2C124<percent>2C868<percent>2C339<percent>2C921<percent>2C638<percent>2C948<percent>2C514<percent>2C943<percent>2C218<percent>2C686<percent>2C963<percent>2C688<percent>2C616<percent>2C518<percent>2C223<percent>2C728<percent>2C516<percent>2C558<percent>2C918<percent>2C138<percent>2C748<percent>2C196<percent>2C618<percent>2C278<percent>2C522<percent>2C692<percent>2C622<percent>2C694<percent>2C156<percent>2C142<percent>2C624<percent>2C449<percent>2C626<percent>2C564<percent>2C628<percent>2C565<percent>2C228<percent>2C283<percent>2C924<percent>2C853<percent>2C233<percent>2C288<percent>2C632<percent>2C293<percent>2C636<percent>2C566<percent>2C634<percent>2C964<percent>2C238<percent>2C182<percent>2C662<percent>2C453<percent>2C960<percent>2C968<percent>2C423<percent>2C922<percent>2C935<percent>2C714<percent>2C128<percent>2C862<percent>2C611<percent>2C135<percent>2C321<percent>2C716<percent>2C243<percent>2C456<percent>2C248<percent>2C722<percent>2C469<percent>2C942<percent>2C253<percent>2C718<percent>2C642<percent>2C724<percent>2C643<percent>2C576<percent>2C939<percent>2C936<percent>2C644<percent>2C961<percent>2C819<percent>2C813<percent>2C172<percent>2C199<percent>2C132<percent>2C733<percent>2C646<percent>2C184<percent>2C648<percent>2C524<percent>2C915<percent>2C361<percent>2C134<percent>2C362<percent>2C652<percent>2C364<percent>2C174<percent>2C732<percent>2C328<percent>2C366<percent>2C258<percent>2C734<percent>2C656<percent>2C144<percent>2C654<percent>2C146<percent>2C336<percent>2C463<percent>2C263<percent>2C528<percent>2C268<percent>2C923<percent>2C532<percent>2C738<percent>2C944<percent>2C578<percent>2C176<percent>2C537<percent>2C534<percent>2C742<percent>2C536<percent>2C866<percent>2C429<percent>2C369<percent>2C433<percent>2C744<percent>2C178<percent>2C186<percent>2C436<percent>2C925<percent>2C136<percent>2C869<percent>2C343<percent>2C746<percent>2C158<percent>2C926<percent>2C439<percent>2C466<percent>2C916<percent>2C112<percent>2C664<percent>2C111<percent>2C826<percent>2C298<percent>2C542<percent>2C927<percent>2C967<percent>2C846<percent>2C443<percent>2C299<percent>2C917<percent>2C582<percent>2C544<percent>2C474<percent>2C941<percent>2C754<percent>2C446<percent>2C698<percent>2C666&s=NGDPDPC&grp=0&a=) so we can get an estimate of what life would be like on 8k a year. It looks like we would be living like people in Southamerica. The average Mexican makes more than 8k, and the average Brazilian makes way more than that, but we would be somewhat better off than the average Cuban, and roughly in the same ballpark as the average Colombian.

To answer this question, we exploit a unique natural experiment<colon> the 2004 expiration of the U.S. Federal Assault Weapons Ban exerted a spillover on gun supply in Mexican municipios near Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico, but not near California, which retained a pre-existing state-level ban. We \ufb01nd \ufb01rst that Mexican municipios located closer to the non-California border states experienced differential increases in homicides, gun-related homicides, and crime gun seizures after 2004. Second, the magnitude of this effect is contingent on political factors related to Mexico\u2019s democratic transition. Killings increased disproportionately in municipios where local elections had become more competitive prior to 2004, with the largest differentials emerging in high narco-traf\ufb01cking areas. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that competition undermined informal agreements between drug cartels and entrenched local governments, highlighting the role of political conditions in mediating the gun-crime relationship.*</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Leaving aside the issue of how this distinction developed as a general cultural current (hopefully a more knowledgeable commentator could give some insight here- especially in regards to feminist movements), and speaking purely in terms of the history of sociological theory, the distinction between sex and gender is part of the conceptual heritage of role theory, which has been a part of sociology since the 1920s, and was most extensively developed in the following decades by two theoretical currents<colon> so-called \u2018symbolic interactionism\u2019 on the one hand (through figures like George Herbert Mead and Herbert Blumer), and \u2018structural-functionalism\u2019 on the other (through figures like Ralph Linton and Talcott Parsons). In terms of the latter, of which I can speak more authoritatively, one key essay is Parsons\u2019 1943 piece \u201cThe Kinship System of the Contemporary United States,\u201d which spoke not of gender but of what at the time was the equivalent concept<colon> the \u2018sex role.\u2019 Parsons essay is notable because it discussed the nature of sex roles within the American family and analysed them in evolutionary, comparative, and functional terms. As such, it obviously and explicitly held that these roles were malleable. <br><br>This is in line with the general framework of Parsonian theory- which understands social action as being comprised of several independent elements which are irreducible to one another. Organismic factors, cultural factors, social factors, and personality factors all play their specific part, but in the case of gender, for example, the organic or biological features of men and women, as well as their individual personalities, were analytically separable from the institutionalized roles, or generalized expectations, which constituted the social background of their behaviour and were necessary for regularity and stability within human interaction. Indeed, that such distinctions were crucial to Parsons is evident in that fact that his theoretical apparatus stressed the idea that societies rely on processes or mechanisms that work to create congruence between personalities and roles (i.e. this congruence was not assumed)- with the most obvious examples being mechanisms of socialization and social control. Although Parsons was by no means the first to articulate a social theory of this kind, his influence in the propagation of role theory is notable, and the nature of his work well expresses the sociological sentiment of the times, as well as the kind of foundation that was prepared for future developments. <br><br>Most specific works on the concept of gender will also point to the enormous influence of John Money, a psychologist/sexologist (and also a student of Parsons) whose studies of sexual confusion and hermaphroditism lead him to explicitly define and promote the idea of the \u2018gender-role,\u2019 beginning from the late 1940s and continuing on in the following decades (his influence was especially augmented by the fact that he published a widely read textbook, *Man & Woman, Boy & Girl*, in 1972). In a 1955 article, for example, Money distinguished between sex, sex-derivative differences, sex-arbitrary differences, and gender-roles, the latter being understood as \u201call those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively,\u201d covering things like sexuality, mannerisms, demeanour, interests, desires, and so on. One can see that these ideas are obviously indebted to previous decades of sociological theorizing, dependent as they are on concepts of roles and socialization. <br><br>One last thing to note is that while all of the aforementioned theories were especially influential in the development of our current sense of gender as an expressive or ontological category, the use of the term \u2018gender\u2019 outside of linguistic circles still took some time to gain momentum. Indeed Udry (1994) makes the point that in a 1967 survey of marriage and family literature, comprising over 12,000 titles published from 1900-1964, the term was not even used once. It is most likely around the tail end of this period that our contemporary sense of the word gender began to grow in recognition and popularity. <br><br>**References<colon>**<br><br>Germon, Jennifer (2009) *Gender<colon> A Genealogy of an Idea.* New York<colon> Palgrave MacMillan. <br><br>Hindin, Michelle J (2007) <dq>Role Theory<dq> in George Ritzer (ed.) *The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology.* Malden, MA<colon> Blackwell Publishing, 3959-3962<br><br>Parsons, Talcott (1943) \u201cThe Kinship System of the Contemporary United States.\u201d *American Anthropologist* 45, no. 1, pp. 23-38.<br><br>Parsons, Talcott (1951) *The Social System.* New York<colon> Free Press. <br><br>Money, John, Hampson, Joan G, Hampson, John (1955) <dq>An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts<colon> The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism.\u201d *Bull.

Most of this will be Pacific North West focused, and some of this will depend on where you<sq>re located. <br><br>Apples are a unique commodity because the varieties you eat are readily apparent to the you the consumer. You can easily distinguish a granny smith from a Fuji from a gala. This is in contrast to say, soft white wheat, which has many varieties that can be grown in diverse regions and blended and milled to homogeneous standards. Furthermore, most apples, regardless of variety, are grown in a select few regions globally (the Wenatchee valley in WA as an example). Varieties in these regions will preform different given growing conditions. Depending on growing conditions in the production regions, the availability of a specific variety can vary year to year. <br><br>Some varieties of apple are much more common than others. Red and yellow delicious use to be far and away the most common, but these varieties have fallen out of favor over the last two decades as consumer preference has moved toward sweeter, crisper varieties like fugi (I can go in to more detail on that shift if your interested). You will see that varieties with the most production will have the most price stability, while new varieties with limited production will have higher prices and more volatility. New varieties will often receive promotional pricing for short periods of time to get new consumer to purchase. <br><br>It also takes a long time for farmers to respond to market conditions. If a farmer sees that demand for a variety is increasing and want to plant new trees to capitalize, it can take upwards of seven years (and as little as three) for the tree to reach production maturity. This results in a very unresponsive supply side of the market and produces a unique challenge for orchard managers. <br><br><br>On top of this, you have a highly concentrated distribution sector in this industry. Most production areas will only have one or two packing houses. This gives the packer a lot of price power and an ability to determine how much of what variety to allow on to the market at a given time. Different apples store for different periods of time, and distribution will reflect this. Apples are also heavy. Since the bulk of apple are produced and stored in specific regions, they are often shipped large distances, causing them to be relatively sensitive to transport costs, which can be an additional source of volatility. <br><br>On the consumer side of things, apple variety are not viewed as perfect substitutes. Different varieties have different uses, and different people have different preferences. So a change in demand for granny smiths (a common baking apple) will have relatively little effect on fujis or galas. While fujis and galas are both seen as fresh eating apples with similar characteristics will share more evidence of consumer substitution given price effects. Taste preference will change seasonably and regionally. <br><br>TLDR; think of each variety of apples as a unique commodity unto itself, with varying degrees of consumer substitution and heterogeneous production characteristics. Comparing apples to apples can sometimes feel like comparing apples to oranges. </p>",

I<sq>ve been reading old ethnographies of the Middle East (Fernea<sq>s *Guests of the Sheik*, Stirling<sq>s *Turkish Village*, Pierce<sq>s *Life in a Turkish Village*, Meeker<sq>s *Republic of Empire* minimally mention this, though I know some others have mentioned it as well).  In all these places, traditionally, there would be no house tour. In rural areas, male visitors are received in a public room. In Turkish called a <dq>guest room<dq> or simple a <dq>room<dq> depending on time and region set aside for this purpose, but would never see the inside, private areas of the dwelling (it<sq>s harder finding out the customs of urban areas). Female visitors, meanwhile, there<sq>s less work on, because until the 80<sq>s there were relatively few female anthropologists, but in rural regions it seems like they were traditionally taken directly into the private, female only space. Fernea is interesting because she<sq>s there with her husband, an anthropologist, and she talks about how she and her husband were never socialize together outside their own home in the year they<sq>re in the village because he stays in the public (male) spaces while she stays in the private (female) spaces when they pay visits together. Fernea and Stirling<sq>s wife are two of the few examples I<sq>ve seen of women doing field work on rural regions from this period. Jenny White did research on urban spaces much more recently, and my memory of her work suggests that she<sq>s also only has access to a public receiving room like the ones male anthropologist of yesterday year (called an <dq>salon<dq> rather than <dq>guest room<dq>, and everyone has one not merely the elite). <br><br>This has been my experience with most people in Turkey as well<colon> when invited over, I stay in a single room and the bathroom (in rural areas, it still very much resembles the convention set up for obvious reasons). For a certain elite level, I<sq>m thinking friends who are educated in the West, I tend to get the tour. But the tour that you<sq>re describing is clearly a specific cultural thing, not a universal thing. But having standard practices for entertaining guests is a universal practice, as far as I<sq>m aware. <br><br>The tour is half the time even recognized as such, as explicit ritual, that this is part of the script of entertaining and receiving guests (I<sq>m think of an episode of the American version of the Office, where Jim basically says <dq>okay, time for the tour<dq> when people come over to his house for a BBQ. You see similar things when Michael and Jan receive guests several seasons later). It<sq>s a hospitality ritual, not so different than the hospitality rituals that Fernea had to learn in rural Iraq in the 1950<sq>s (hers differed for men and women--for men, she was basically absent except for a brief interlude after eating, but for women she had to offer tea, cigarettes, and probably some seeds to eat to count as a good host). <br><br>Every culture has specific rituals which indicate a guest is welcome.

And, even less surprisingly, he related it to anal eroticism. (As a quick aside, I<sq>m really beginning to wonder if a cigar was *just* a cigar) [1](http<colon>//www.richardtrachtman.com/pdf/moneytaboo.pdf). There is good reason to believe that the taboo persisted well before that, but it is the earliest reference I could personally find. <br><br>Without a definitive start date, some may be inclined to believe that  we<sq>ve always had this taboo-- or at least some type of it. Personally, that<sq>s the attitude I went into this question with. After all, money has been around for over 4,000 years [2](http<colon>//samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781317798712_sample_829524.pdf) and our tribal psychology invites trepidation into situations where our social standing is on the line. Indeed, some have speculated that discussions of money fall under such situations [2](http<colon>//samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781317798712_sample_829524.pdf) since we often tie worth to income and to financial price [3](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).  This could reasonably lead people to conclude that it<sq>s simply inherent to human thought. Talking about money can dredge up a lot of social comparisons and expectations which could trigger that tribal instinct saying <dq>let<sq>s not put ourselves in a lower position on the social strata so that we<sq>re not eventually ostracized [5](http<colon>//www.richardtrachtman.com/pdf/moneytaboo.pdf).<dq><br><br>There<sq>s only one problem with this<colon> If it was universal, we would expect different cultures to have a similar reticence to income. But they don<sq>t [6](http<colon>//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1470-6431.1993.tb00181.x/abstract). Even countries as geographically proximal as Japan and China have different attitudes about money as indicated by their folklore [7](http<colon>//abs.sagepub.com/content/45/2/307.short). <br><br>So we are left with the idea that this is a western construction. To be clear, I definitely think that the proclivity to tie social worth with the amount of stuff one has probably dates back quiet a while as it would be a handy hint throughout much of human history. But the actual taboo seems to be western in origin.<br><br>I don<sq>t think that we<sq>ll be able to find a specific date, time, or even location to pin this origination on. However, if allowed to venture an educated guess, I would posit that they came from our coffee shops. <br><br>It<sq>s well known that coffee and tea shops were instrumental to the formulation and actualization of many western uprisings [8](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/A-History-World-6-Glasses/dp/0802715524). These institutions looked to turn the current social status quo on its head. Inside the shops, everyone was theoretically equal. A certain code of conversation developed, largely thanks to the propagation of two magazines<colon> The Spectator and the Tatler [9](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette#Politeness). I cannot find any direct quotes from either publication that specifically dictates that one ought not to make note of the socioeconomic differences that exist outside of the shop-- however, there is decent evidence for tacit recommendations via the emphasis on maintaining a tempered and productive conversation [9](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette#Politeness). I contend that it<sq>s difficult to have a good chat when you<sq>re being actively singled out as an impecunious peon. Such an account would work fairly well with our theoretical understanding of taboo construction. As it goes, taboos are extremely strong norms and mores that deliver intense social (and possibly even official) sanctions [10](http<colon>//rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/taboo.pdf). They can develop from social rules and evolve along with the society; hence why some taboo subjects are less taboo as they used to be and others are even more forbidden. I would venture that the taboo for discussing income developed on this track. It could have started off as an expression of politeness and proper etiquette and developed more bite as western society grew more infatuated with the idea of human equality. There aren<sq>t any studies that directly prove or disprove this theory (possibly due to a dearth of literature on the topic of money [2](http<colon>//samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781317798712_sample_829524.pdf)), so take it with a grain of salt. <br><br>I would also like to recommend the book that U/David_divaD did as well as *The Psychology of Money* by Furnham and Argyle. </p>",

I study International Law, so I<sq>m using my textbook as a reference (it<sq>s called International Law, it<sq>s the fourth edition, and it<sq>s edited by Malcolm D. Evans. I<sq>d definitely read it if I were you, but I<sq>ll be using the chapter entitled *Statehood, Self-Determination, and Recognition.*) In this book, the four main principles a State should fulfill are delineated in Article 1 of the International Law Commission<sq>s Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States, copied below<colon><br><br>*The State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications<colon><br><br>a) a permanent population;<br><br>b) a defined territory;<br><br>c) government; and<br><br>d) capacity to enter into relations with other states.*<br><br>Following this definition, ISIS definitely fulfills none of these criteria, except *maybe* the third, though due to drone strikes and assassinations, that remains a disputed fact. According to this document, then, ISIS is *not* a legitimate State, nor is it even theoretically eligible for Statehood, or recognition as such. <br><br>It is important to mention, however, the inherent limitations of this very generic definition supplied by the ILC. Indeed, claiming that to be a State, one needs to be able to declare itself as having people, territory, and a form of government is really to say very little. What appears to be needed here, is one of two things.<br><br>1. It requires a quantitative measure of intensity<colon> instead of merely necessitating the *existence* of a people, a territory, and something that describes itself as a government, it requires that these qualities are possessed *in sufficient degree*. These must be large enough and effective enough to warrant the State being regarded as both economically, socially, and culturally self-sufficient, and, as the final qualification suggests, have the capacity to enter into relations with other States.<br><br>2. Another possibility is that it requires some qualitative evaluation - rather than merely expecting a claim to be made in respect of a people or territory, it expects those claims to be justified in some way. For example, on the basis that they respond to a principle of self-determination, or are capable of substantiation without impinging upon the rights and duties of other sovereign States (something ISIS can<sq>t do, since it<sq>s obviously impinging upon the rights of *many* States). <br><br>Furthermore, as written by Matthew Craven in the textbook (really, this is a great textbook), <dq>...the question remains as to how one might conceive of a moment in which sovereign authority is created out of the mere fact of the... violent seizure of power?<dq> (216). This is answered in a lecture entitled <dq>Force of Law<colon> The Mystical Foundation of Authority<dq>, wherein Jacques Derrida posed the following question<colon><br><br><dq>How are we to distinguish between the force of law of a legitimate power and the supposedly originary violence that must have established this authority that could not itself have been authorised by any anterior legitimacy, so that, in this initial moment, it is neither legal nor illegal - or, others would quickly say, neither just nor unjust?<dq><br><br>Lastly, and this sort of blew my mind because it made quite good sense, *how* can we define ISIS as a State? We are presented with two difficulties.<br><br>1. In order to sustain the argument that other States may authorise or validate the existence of a new State, one would have to determine the basis upon which those authorities claim that ability. How might existing States being into existence another State without the latter being seen, in some respects, as a subordinate authority? <br><br>2. In a world already fully demarcated in terms of sovereign jurisdiction (though I<sq>m guessing Putin might disagree!), the process of <dq>creation<dq> (of a State) can only be achieved by way of displacing in some manner the prior claims to sovereignty of an existing State. Unless existing claims to territorial sovereignty are lifted or suspended in some way, the emergence of a new State cannot be achieved without some measure of illegality.  <br><br>In conclusion, the problem remains one of how the sovereignty of a State moves from *de facto* to *de jure* status, or from <dq>fact<dq> to <dq>law<dq>, and can<sq>t really be solved unless negotiations take place. Which seems unlikely.  </p>",

Essentially, your name becomes symbolic of you and all the things you actively associate with your identity. This means that if you identify as a runner, if you sign your name before you go athletic shoe shopping, then you are more likely to put more consideration in to the decision of what shoes you should purchase than if you did not sign your name. I am not aware of any studies in my field related to the changing of name and the effect on identity, but it would be very interesting. Theory would suggest that using an old name (for example a maiden name) might prime attitudes and behaviors that your strongly associate with that name (for example, stronger associations with sports played in high school or allegiance to a state where one resided as a child/young adult) whereas your current name would prime your current identity, but also in the context of comparing it to your maiden name, potentially parts of your identity that you associate with the time which your name was changed (your hobbies, interests when you were married).<br><br>Source<colon>http<colon>//www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/659753</p>",

An authorization bill usually defines the rules and the function of a program, gives a particular office or agency the authority to implement it, and suggests funding levels. It can be permanent or temporary, but even temporary bills usually authorize programs for longer terms like five years. <br><br>An appropriations bill actually gives the government the go-ahead to spend $x on the program next year. The idea is that Congress passes one big budget every year appropriating money for all the programs that have been authorized, but as you probably know in the past few years they<sq>ve been relying on [continuing resolutions](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_resolution) that basically say <dq>keep spending like you<sq>ve been spending<dq>. For some programs like Medicare, the authorizing acts actually include the appropriations, so the programs gets funded whether a budget gets passed or not\u2014for this reason, they<sq>re called [mandatory spending](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_spending).<br><br>Now, to your question<colon> how common is it for Congress to authorize something but never actually cut the check?

As [Harry Reid said in 2008](http<colon>//www.c-spanvideo.org/appearance/595274520)<colon> <br>>Authorizations allow programs to be created and funded.

The Luddites, for example, went around breaking looms in the early 19th century because they saw the machines as stealing their jobs.  And they were right -- machine looms could produce material faster and cheaper than manual work.  For a brief period, the owners of the capital (the factory owners) were able to increase their profit at the expense of labor.<br><br>What the [Luddites](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) failed to account for, though, was the broad economic effect of industrialization.  The automatic looms were disruptive in the short term, but by both freeing up labor *and* reducing costs for the final manufactured good, the end result was positive<colon> *all* consumers get cheaper cloth, while only a few lose their jobs.  All that extra capital now in consumers hands is freed up for other purchases, driving the economy to further growth.  That growth can easily accommodate the weavers who were initially out of work.<br><br>Now, all throughout the 19th and 20th centuries this process continues over and over again.  More innovation, more social disruption, more economic growth.  The big change, though, is that these disruptions and innovations are happening faster and faster.  First it<sq>s a 100 year interval, then 50, 25... and today it<sq>s less than 10.  What<sq>s more, instead of being confined to a single industry, innovations like the computer are ransacking the entire job sector at once, forcing obsolescence on hundreds of thousands of jobs at a time.<br><br>In the early 19th century, the social disruption of technological innovation was easy to deal with, it was slow enough to integrate the newly unemployed into other areas, and it didn<sq>t affect enough people to make it a serious threat to stability (other effects of industrialization did, but thats another story).<br><br>Today, though, the job you train the first 20 years of your life for might not exist by the time you<sq>re 50.

                "answer": "<p>As previous commentors have pointed out, laziness is both a normative category and (possibly) a psychological (biological?) state. I would like to turn the flashlight to the normative category (e.g. lazy people or person). The idea of laziness is nothin new, I have never seen anyone argue that laziness have not been a category in previous societies. What does such a category entail?<br><br>If we look to scholars of social control, such as Max Weber or Michel Foucault these are pretty clear on that categories such as <sq>lazy<sq> are used to order society. Looking to e.g. Weber<sq>s <dq>The protestant ethic and the spirit of captialism<dq> laziness comes of as an important categorization of <sq>unworthy<sq> people. A justification of either their poverty or misery (in the case they are poor or miserable) or the justification of despise for their <sq>decadance<sq> (in case they are wealthy and live good lives). From the perspective of governmentality, laziness is used to discipline people into not only obeying but to want to obey - i.e. feeling good and be granted acknowledgement from other people about not being lazy (or vice versa). <br><br>Laziness thus exists as a socio-cultural category. This category is institutionalised and we use it to organise society and our personal lives. Thus, laziness need not have a biological or psychological primacy to exist. As long as we believe that there are lazy and non-lazy people, and that there is an important difference between them, laziness exists for all intents and purposes.<br><br>This also leads to the problem of looking for laziness in biology or psychology. As previous commentors have pointed out, there may be depressive states that can come of as laziness - but seems fairly sure that this is not actual laziness. Thus, defining something in biology or psychology as laziness only shows the institutionalisation of this categorisation of people. In the end, naming something laziness (a normative category) does not mean that it is laziness, just that we can make sense of it this way in our present culture. Most people (except those who believe in eugenics) probably agree on that people are not born worthy or unworthy.</p>",

In this region, 60<percent> of truckers are Indo-Canadian, but they make up 70<percent> of trafficking related crime. This is attributed to these drivers being more likely to take long-haul assignments that native North American drivers wouldn<sq>t be as likely to accept.

The rebound means that the person breaking up stops seeing themselves as part of the original relationship, family and friends stop seeing them as being part of the original relationship, which in turn means that family and friends may pressure them less to rekindle the original relationship...it basically has the effect of finalising the end of the original relationship.<br><br><br>She also said that these rebound relationships tended not to last, and I have a recollection of her saying (but don<sq>t quote me) that who a person rebounds with is more a matter of convenience than anything else.

It<sq>s possible the in utero exposure *might* play a role in a number of things such as sexual orientation, gender identity, and some mental disorders. Then add hormone exposure throughout the life from things like diet and other behaviors and you have a real mess to unpack.<br><br>People are often prescribed gender roles/norms before even being born.

If they are a female, well we<sq>d better put a bow on her bald head to avoid confusion by strangers about what it is and how to behave around it. Does that really matter?

[Here is a great intro](http<colon>//www.cep.ucsb.edu/primer.html) that explains why this is a false dichotomy, along with other common false dichotomies such as innate/learned, nature/nurture, etc.<br><br>A better way to phrase the question might be what behavioral differences between men and women seem to be species-typical, reliably developing traits, or which differences are seen across cultures. To answer this question you might check out [Donald Brown<sq>s book Human Universals](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Universals), work by [David Buss](http<colon>//homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Group/BussLAB/), [Todd Shackelford](http<colon>//www.toddkshackelford.com/index.html), [Steve Gangestad](http<colon>//psych.unm.edu/people/directory-profiles/steven-gangestad.html), or [Randy Thornhill](http<colon>//biology.unm.edu/Thornhill/rthorn.htm).<br><br>One thing to note. This kind of question is often highly contentious and moralized because people think that gender equality is somehow dependent on the answer coming out in a certain way (this position is often referred to as gender feminism). Predicating moral truths on scientific ones that may be wrong is not a good way to make the argument, because if the facts come out wrong, the argument crumbles (which is why people get so fanatical about how <dq>biology can never explain gender differences<dq>). Given our long evolutionary history as mammals, it would be incredibly surprising if there were not some behavioral differences between men and women, and so this is a pretty shaky foundation for a moral argument. Rather, the moral argument should be made on moral grounds--men and women should be treated equally and given equal opportunity because that is how we want to structure our society, not because they feel sexual jealousy in exactly the same way, or have the exact same visuospatial capabilities, or the exact same linguistic abilities (this position is often referred to as equity feminism, and I think it<sq>s [much more defensible than gender feminism](http<colon>//www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-entertainment/201205/giving-feminism-bad-name)). While your question is based on a false dichotomy, questions in a similar vein (such as I noted above) are certainly amenable to scientific scrutiny, and research on the topic has found robust, cross-cultural differences between men and women, some of which we can predict from evolutionary biology (like differences in mating behavior), some of which we can<sq>t easily predict and are not well understood (like differences in spatial cognition or verbal abilities). Rather than take a position like the Catholic Church took in the 1600s, I think it<sq>s better to make the moral claims on moral grounds, and let the empirical chips fall where they may.</p>",

People who are adamant that the biological determinants of sex-linked behavioral traits cannot be identified should ask themselves whether and how they think biological determinants of sex-linked *non-behavioral traits* can be identified or not. Imagine that a person insisted to you that women have larger breasts than men was merely due to cultural expectations placed on women, rather than biological predisposition? Would you agree with this person, just laugh at them, or *attempt to offer evidence against their argument*? If the latter, what form would this evidence take?<br><br>imo, the best literature on identifying gender and behavior are the [2d<colon>4d digit studies](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio), which uses a subtle proxy for uterine testosterone levels (assumed to be exogenous) to measure the effect of androgens on behavior. For example, we have studies showing that uterine testosterone influences [risk taking behavior](http<colon>//link.springer.com/article/10.1007<percent>2Fs11166-010-9109-6) - this is big for economists. So one merely has to make the reasonable leap that the fact that testosterone modulates behaviors *within* genders may imply that testosterone also modulates behavior *between* genders. Again, someone with a low enough (politically-motivated) prior could say that this is an unjustified leap of inference, but then I<sq>d ask how they think that something like the facial hair / gender link is also a social construct (showing it isn<sq>t would probably rely on making an androgen-based argument in a similar fashion.)

His First Wave started whenever modern democracy started (1776 or the Jacksonian period with the abolition of criteria for voting beyond being white and male) and continued on very, very slowly until dictators started to rise to power in the 1920<sq>s Europe, dismantling many democracies (Mussolini was the first). By 1942, there were only 12 democracies left. This was mostly transitions from monarchy/aristocracy to democracy. <br><br>The Second Wave was post-WW2 and until about 1962, when the wave peaked at 36 democracies. Then military coups and what have you brought that down to about 30 for a decade or two. The growth in this wave was partially monarch to democracy in decolonization and partially totalitarian single party states to democracy, if I remember correctly. <br><br>Huntington was writing about the then recent <dq>[Third Wave](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Wave_Democracy)<dq> (<dq>the Catholic Wave<dq>, though it involved East Asian countries too). This was mostly military dictators and single party states losin power. First the dictators in Western Europe (Spain, Portugal) fell/died in the 70<sq>s, and then Southeastern Europe (Turkey Greece), East Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines), and  Latin America (almost all of if) in the late 1970<sq>s/80<sq>s, then finally most former Eastern Bloc and the Baltic states (but not really most of the rest of the Former Soviet Union [FSU]) after 1989.  It more or less triples the number of democracies in the world (+/- depending on how you count democracies). This is really the period when liberal democracy starts becoming an international norm, which eventually leads to an increase in the number of illiberal democracies as well. <br><br>There have been recent cases before the Arab Spring, the so-called <dq>[Color Revolutions](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_revolutions)<dq> starting with Serbia in 2000. The <dq>Jasmine Revolution<dq> of Tunisia was put in this category before Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Libya happened (which is called the Arab Spring by non-specialists, but specialists are more likely to use other terms like <dq>the Arab Uprisings<dq> or the rather sanguine <dq>Arab Awakening<dq>).  Is this a <dq>Fourth Wave<dq>? Some have hoped yes, but the result have been pretty mixed. For every success story (Serbia, Tunisia) there has been one or more failures (especially in the Arab World, but also in the former Soviet Sphere). I<sq>m not particularly optimistic. There are also a few recent cases of democratization (Senegal, Indonesia, Iraq) that don<sq>t fit the Color Revolution or the Arab Spring narrative, generally in the Muslim. At this point, once we control for development however measured, the FSU states and the Arab World (but *not* the rest of the Muslim World) seriously underperform in terms of expected democratization. Things will keep on happening in these regions, but whether they<sq>ll result in increased democratization only time will tell (one theory is resources, especially oil and gas, and regional powers, like Russia, Iran and Saudi, prop up non-democrats). Then again, when the <dq>Third Wave<dq> started in 1974, it was almost impossible to imagine that there<sq>d be democracy on Eastern Europe within 15 years.  <br><br>Of course, this is about waves of *democracy*. Waves of *revolution*, a interrelated but separate set; the two most common waves, as people have mentioned, are 1848 and 1989, but the wave of decolonization after WW2 is another to look at. Maybe one could argue about failed revolutions in Eastern Bloc states (Hungary in 56, Prague Spring), and the Latin American independence wars against Spain from like 1812-1835 or whatever it is exactly (in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars until whenever Spain called it quits on it<sq>s continental possessions). There were also the Revolutions of 1917-1923 (check wiki) kicked off by the Russian Revolution, but most of the communist ones failed but more of the more populist ones succeeded (Turkey, Ireland, Egypt). These were generally united by nationalism and constitutionalism more than things like democracy or explicit socialism.<br><br>Lastly, it<sq>s worth it to think about whether all <dq>revolutions<dq> are made equal (all democracies certainly are not). When we think <dq>revolution<dq>, we normally think of the great <dq>social revolutions<dq> (to use Theda Skocpol<sq>s term) like France, China, Russia. We think less about the poltical revolutions, where who ruled and how they<sq>re chosen changed considerably but daily life changed less, cases like America or the Bulldozer Revolution in Serbia. While no one expected the Arab Spring to completely reorder the political sphere, it<sq>s interesting to think about whether it has or hasn<sq>t reordered daily life. In Libya and Tunisia, it *seems* (there<sq>s been relatively little written about this so far), the Revolutions successfully dismantled what<sq>s called the <dq>presidential security state<dq> (aka these countries had not just a secret police, but they all had multiple, competing secret polices--see Roger Owen<sq>s recent book). Egypt, it<sq>s clear, has failed to fully dismantle its security state, likely because of the outsized role the military plays in the economy and politics. Ditto, Syria. Do Tunisia and Libya count as social revolutions? Time will tell and I wish there had been more written on it (the English language academics all write about Egypt but rarely actually write in Tunisa. What there is mostly in French or translations of French originals. I helped a professor update his post 1989 transitions with stuff from the 2010-11 Arab Uprisings, there<sq>s relatively little that has happened since then, especially in places that aren<sq>t Egypt of Syria.

                "answer": "<p>In sociology, there are at least two sets of opinions<colon> one for U.S. cities, one for cities in the Global South (there is likely a third set for Europe, but I<sq>ve encountered that literature a lot less--I can recommend some of Loic Wacquant<sq>s comparisons of the ghetto and the French banlieue, if you<sq>re interested).<br><br>From what I can gather, the prognosis is not particularly good for American areas of concentrated urban poverty.  The effects of <dq>**neighborhood effects**<dq> is one of the hot issues in urban sociology<colon> holding all else constant, is just being exposed to a bad neighborhood enough to have negative outcomes (in health, education, mortality, etc)?  This fits into sociology<sq>s recent emphasis on networks in general (many, but by no means all, people think of neighborhood effects in network terms).  The evidence of neighborhood effects is mixed and is still being debated, with some studies finding that neighborhoods do matter, some finding that moving people out of bad neighborhoods leads to only minor, and uneven improvements in well-being (IIRC, it helped women more than men).  This big study called [Moving to Opportunity](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_to_Opportunity) was supposed to figure this out, but what happened was that people from bad neighborhoods, in effect, mostly moved to other bad neighborhoods, despite being given vouchers so that they could afford better housing (this was theorized to be, again, from network effects<colon> people from bad neighborhoods primarily knew people from other bad neighborhoods).  <br><br>**Gentrification** is another big issue in sociology.  Here, poor people are being displaced from poor neighborhoods by rising rents caused by increased demand from young people moving to or staying in cities, a sort of [reverse white flight](http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/nyregion/23census.html?_r=0).  This is supposed to displace poor and working class people from the neighborhoods they currently live in (I can give you specific examples, but likely, if you live in the U.S., you can think of a neighborhood where this is happening).  I haven<sq>t seen a census-based study on this (but this isn<sq>t my main field, I obviously mainly get into urban sociology through studying religion, so I<sq>m positive these studies exist, I<sq>m just not sure what they<sq>ve found), but things like Moving to Opportunity and qualitative evidence leads me to think that the people who can no longer afford to live in the neighborhood move to other poor neighborhoods, or even poor suburbs!  This is a trend that some people are predicting--an American spatial distribution of urban wealth an poverty closer to the European mode with wealthy cores and poorer peripheries.  I haven<sq>t seen a lot published on it, but I remember a year or two ago noticing several grants for studies on <dq>suburban poverty<dq> (something, as far as Google scholar can tell me, people have only really started wondering about in the past five or ten years).<br><br>Lastly, we can think of **the causes of urban poverty**.  In American sociology, William Julius Wilson is probably the dean of contemporary urban sociologists.  He argues in books like *the Truly Disadvantaged* and *When Work Disappears*, that the much of contemporary urban poverty is caused by deindustrialization, declining wages, and declining access to jobs (both physically, such as through public transit, and more metaphorically, through skills mismatches), especially good jobs.  This is not the only causal factor Wilson and similar scholars talk about (redlining, segregation, white flight, flight of the black middle class, changes in family structure all also matter), but the <dq>employment-side<dq> is probably the one that<sq>s having the largest effect right now.  More popularly, people say Wilson<sq>s work was one of inspirations for the second season of *the Wire* (it<sq>s the second worst season, I know, but the second worst season of *the Wire* is still an awesome season).  Extending Wilson, it<sq>s easy to say that without people having access to stable, well-paying jobs (which doesn<sq>t seem on the horizon), areas of <dq>[concentrated urban poverty](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_poverty)<dq> (to use the technical term) seem to be here for the easily foreseeable future.  Sudhir Venkatesh in *Off the Books* shows that many of the people who are officially unemployed do work, irregularly, in the underground economy, but obviously these <dq>off the books<dq> jobs (back alley mechanic, drug dealer, living room hair stylist, DIY caterer) are not, for the most part, pulling people out of poverty.<br><br>See, the defining feature of <dq>the ghetto<dq> is it used to hold people of one category (Jews, Blacks, what have you), but many socio-economic classes (read *the Black Metropolis* for an account of the black ghetto in Chicago in the 1930<sq>s and W.E.B. Du Bois has a cool account of the Philadelphia ghetto from earlier than that), meaning that the ghettos traditionally had their own sets of institutions, economic and social, separated from their mainstream counterparts.  Wacquant argues that we<sq>re now have <dq>**hyperghetto**<dq>, that is, ghettos where the middle class has left, leaving only a stigmatized and heavily policed underclass who has no way out.  In his book *Heat Wave*, Eric Klinenberg does a really interesting comparison between two adjacent communities in Chicago<colon> a thriving, relatively safe majority Hispanic community and a depopulated primarily black neighborhood full of empty lots.  Though both have comparable per capita incomes, social capital in the two places is vastly different.  During a deadly Heat Wave, the a lot of people died in the Black neighborhood, but relatively few people died in the Hispanic neighborhood.  Wacquant also draws a direct line from slavery, to Jim Crow, to the ghetto, to the hyperghetto (Wilson would not draw as straight a line, and in fact wrote a book in the 70<sq>s called *The Declining Significance of Race*, which argued that race is of declining importance, and class is of increasing importance).  Wacquant particularly emphasizes the relationship between prison and areas of concentrated poverty in the era of **mass incarceration**.  Other sociologists, Michelle Alexander and Alice Goffman, draw similar conclusions about the relationship between mass incarceration and poor neighborhoods--Alexander goes as far as to call it the <dq>New Jim Crow<dq> and Goffman studies (qualitatively) how mass incarceration effects even people not directly in the prison system.  Connecting this back to Wilson, it<sq>s obviously much harder to get a <dq>good job<dq> if one has a prison record (Goffman, Alexander, and Wacquant argue for effects far beyond just difficulties in getting a job) and even if, say, marijuana were legalized tomorrow, there would still be two generations of people with criminal records that aren<sq>t going to go away.<br><br>[Edit<colon> I mention in a comment below Eli Anderson, who argues in *Code of the Street* that <dq>oppositional street-oriented<dq> culture plays a role in urban poverty and crime as well, though most other contemporary sociologists are reluctant to touch that because it gets into <dq>**culture of poverty**<dq> ideas that were prevalent in the 60<sq>s and were influential in the Reagan administration and are mostly used in rather unempirical, politicized way by the Right today.  Wilson, for example, dismisses this idea as a primary causal mechanism in most of his work, though I assume appreciates Anderson<sq>s other work like *Streetwise* and *A Place on the Corner*.  Instead of a <dq>culture of poverty<dq>, the sociological mainstream might be more amenable to <dq>**cycles of poverty**<dq>/<dq>poverty trap<dq>, which emphasizes the structural reasons why people get mired in poverty over individual lifetimes and intergenerationally.  Here<sq>s an [okay NY Times article](http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/us/18poverty.html?pagewanted=all) about sociologists reexaming cultural explanations--always in addition to structural ones.  You can tell from the article that top sociologists who are willing to think of culture, like Mario Small and Robert Sampson, think of <dq>culture<dq> in very different terms from welfare critics who argue that welfare creates a <dq>culture of dependency<dq>.  That<sq>s not what they are talking about at all.  Here<sq>s a [PDF](ftp<colon>//classes.waynesburg.edu/History/Kent<percent>20James/HIS336<percent>20US<percent>20After<percent>201945/Readings/Poverty/Poverty2012.pdf) the introduction to the special volume that that article is talking about if you<sq>re interested in the subject.  It<sq>s clearly a very politicized, touchy subject].<br><br>I think you<sq>re asking mainly about the U.S., so I<sq>ll give less details about the details of **urban poverty in the Global South** (if you don<sq>t know what that means, think <dq>developing world<dq>), but here people are much more optimistic, though the optimism is mixed.  It<sq>s also mixed by region.  Mike Davis<sq>s *Planet of Slums* is an almost journalistic overview, which emphasizes how bad slums are.  There are chapters in Sassen<sq>s *Cities in a World Economy* (which we use as a text book in our class about cities around the world) which are much more optimistic about slums--slums are places of irregular economies and housing, but they are productive and intimately linked with the global economy (perhaps, most famously, Dharavi in the middle of Mumbai).<br><br>**~~Three~~ Four last notes**<colon> all criminologists would want me to point out that violent crime has reduced dramatically in the last 20 years.  I believe poverty was also decreasing before the economic crisis.  These things are certainly changing, but very slowly. The crack epidemic of the early 90<sq>s hasn<sq>t gone away so much as normalized--there<sq>s less profits in it and less fighting over turf, but that<sq>s still something that goes on.  And two, I imagine the sociological perspective is the most pessimistic of all the social sciences on this issue and by no means the only one worth listening to.  However, three, all sociologists would argue that there are structural reasons these areas of concentrated urban poverty exist, and without changing those structures, we probably will only see gradual change at best.  Bonus fourth note<colon> Wilson<sq>s solution to urban poverty, by the way, is a large Great Depression-style jobs program.</p>",

We seem to understand this intuitively in the context of private schools; no one is surprised when the country day school has higher science scores than the evangelical Christian school.  So we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when there are Charters that do both better and worse than their traditional public school counterparts. <br><br>So yes, you can find peer-reviewed, soundly conducted studies that show that Charters improve student outcomes (meaning test scores)\u2026 as well as ones that show Charters negatively impact student outcomes.  Both statements are true \u2013 it depends on the Charter.  The better question to ask from an education standpoint is why.  (I guess the better question from a social standpoint would be \u201cis it worth the cost to the educational system?\u201d but that\u2019s outside the scope of your question.)<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019ve seen a number of studies that have shown positive outcomes for KIPP / No Excuses-type charter schools in low-income communities.

It does however come with some caveats about precisely how much time the father takes. This is because, to put it bluntly, causality is a bitch in the study of leave use and fertility. Individuals develop their careers and their leave usage around their future plans and so its hard to tell whether people are having more kids because of that leave policy or whether they are gravitating towards using that policy because they are the type of person who wants more kids.  <br><br>The limitation of the policy to Scandinavian Countries also creates clustering and regime based issues in assessing policy impact. Paternal leave is just one strand of the Nordic Family policy model alongside well-paid parental leave, subsidized childcare and flexible labour market arrangements. To therefore isolate the effect of the Daddy quota becomes problematic from a Scientific point of view. Given this, I would not trust any macro-assessments of the policy impact. <br><br>Sorry I couldn<sq>t give anymore empirical evidence, but good evidence is really sparse because of these data limitations and analytical constraints. The predominant theories in demographic sociology all incline toward suggesting that daddy quota<sq>s are good for fertility though. As I mentioned, Daddy Quota<sq>s have been shown to affect the distribution of housework and in separate studies there have been relatively strong indications that an equal distribution of housework leads to higher fertility so most theories just connect the dots (not always a robust strategy). A good overview of this idea is available in [this piece](http<colon>//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2015.00024.x/full) from Esping-Andersen and Billari from last year.<br></p>",

The idea you<sq>re looking for is <dq>[Natural Rate of Unemployment](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rate_of_unemployment)<dq> or <dq>[Full Employment](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment).<dq>  You could look at either as a long-run [Philips Curve](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve).  Modern economists look at more than a Philips curve to think about unemployment ([NAIRU](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIRU) is another way to think about full employment) but I can give you the intuition.  <br><br>Even when the economy is in equilibrium, some people in every time period are separated from their jobs.  Maybe they moved, maybe they didn<sq>t like their boss, maybe their company folded due to mismanagement.  Although there are jobs available for these newly unemployed people, it takes time for the employer and employee to find each other and agree on compensation, benefits, etc.  Job searching has transactional costs.  So even without any cyclical or deficient-demand unemployment, we have unemployment - we call people between employers <dq>frictional unemployment.<dq>  <br><br>The predicted level of unemployment in a long-run full employment society depends on the economist, society, time period, etc.  I can<sq>t say whether 5.5<percent> is low or high, just know that economists only agree it is something larger than zero.  Frictional employment go lower than this level, but that isn<sq>t necessarily good because it may represent people staying in jobs to which they are poorly matched or overqualified or whatever. <br><br>The specific claim about inflation is related to NAIRU - <dq>Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment.<dq> I can do rough justice, enough to give you the intuition.  If there is very low frictional unemployment, employers may have a hard time finding qualified individuals to fill open jobs.  To fill those jobs they may need to offer a higher wage.  This will cause people in similar jobs to move to the open job for the higher wage.  Their former employers may need to raise wages to retain current employees or get new employees.  Thus wages in certain sectors rise, but unrelated to productivity.  </p>",

The article, for some strange reason, does not mention the *more* isolated group on the Andaman Islands, the [Sentinelese](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese_people) (so isolated we don<sq>t even know what they call themselves).  This group has been effectively, more or less, culturally quarantined.  They are on an island with no non-indigenous settlement, Sentinel Island, unlike the Jarawa, who are on South Andaman Island, which is home to only non-indigenous settlement generally, but is even the location of Port Blair, the area<sq>s capital and largest city.

The article goes into some detail about what has happened to other indigenous Andaman groups, including the Jarawa.  It also details attempts to contact the Sentinelese by the Indian government.

But comparing outcomes among the Sentinelese, the Jarawa, the [Onge](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onge_people), and the many groups of [Great Andamanese](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Andamanese_people), the less contact they have had, the better outcomes for the group almost no matter how you measure outcomes.  As long as there is an Andaman Trunk Road, however, the Jarawa can never really be isolated again.  There have been no serious proposals, to my knowledge, to shut the road down.  There have been only attempts to keep the people on the road and off the road as separate as possible.  Where does that leave us?  I<sq>m not sure.

                "answer": "<p>Just to be explicit here, our ideas about homosexuality are relatively recent.  [From the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*](http<colon>//plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/) (just because it is convenient and anyone can read it)<colon> <br><br>> As has been frequently noted, the ancient Greeks did not have terms or concepts that correspond to the contemporary dichotomy of \u2018heterosexual\u2019 and \u2018homosexual\u2019. There is a wealth of material from ancient Greece pertinent to issues of sexuality, ranging from dialogues of Plato, such as the Symposium, to plays by Aristophanes, and Greek artwork and vases. What follows is a brief description of ancient Greek attitudes, but it is important to recognize that there was regional variation. For example, in parts of Ionia there were general strictures against same-sex eros, while in Elis and Boiotia (e.g., Thebes), it was approved of and even celebrated (cf. Dover, 1989; Halperin, 1990).<br><br>There<sq>s no reason to doubt the same could not be said about India.  There were licit (socially acceptable) sex acts that we<sq>d class as <dq>homosexual<dq> (sex with a Hijra, for example) and illicit sex acts we<sq>d call <dq>homosexual<dq>, just as the Greek had licit and illicit sex acts that we<sq>d recognize as homosexual.  It likely varied a lot by social circumstance (a high status man in the city would be expected to behave in a different way from a low status woman in the countryside; mystics and what not, especially after the advent of Tantra, had their own sets of rules).<br><br>So before the this discussion goes further, it<sq>s important to recognize that these are our categories.  Muslims, too, had licit forms of what we might call homosexual behavior--here<sq>s an example of a [Persian Shah and his <dq>wine boy<dq>](http<colon>//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File<colon>Shah_Abbas_and_Wine_Boy.jpg) (the first Muslim rulers in India had a heavy Persianate influence).  In fact, one could even argue that Christians had semi-acceptable forms of homosexual sex (for example in the Royal Navy, see this [popular historical examination of the topic](http<colon>//www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2794/rum-sodomy-and-the-lash)).<br><br>Which is not to say that Mughal rule and law, and then British rule and law, didn<sq>t change social relationships and moral categories in India--it certainly did.  But it would be naive to argue that it went from free love to oppression because of some invaders.  Getting into specifics, the [Laws of Manu](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusmriti), one of the oldest normative Hindu law codes, certainly doesn<sq>t look particularly kindly on homosexual behavior (because, remember, people were looking at behavior, not our categories) but it is not particularly severe in its punishments.  Like almost many ancient religious law codes, it<sq>s unclear 1) to what degree it was enforced, and 2) whether it was ever even meant to be enforced, or whether it was meant to be a sort of ideal system (for one group of people), and 3) there<sq>s debates about what<sq>s original and what was a later addition.  Suffice to say, it<sq>s difficult to parse out.  But it<sq>s also important to recognize that what we call Hinduism today varied much more place to place than things like Islam or Christianity; Sudipta Kaviraj calls the local versions of religion <dq>thick religion<dq>, whereas the translocal, more identity based version found in modern religion he calls <dq>thin religion<dq>.  I would be shocked if the <dq>thick religious<dq> views on homosexual behavior didn<sq>t vary tremendously in India across time and space, with or without the Mughals and the British.  What Dirks argues in *Castes of Mind* is that British *codified* Hinduism as a single religion, and in the process often made rigid what had previously been much more flexible.  </p>",

For sure, the theory would be very descriptive of the conditions faced by heroin dealers in Baltimore during the summer.  But it would require so many assumptions that it would be unclear which were the most important, which were actually trivial, and whether the model could be applicable to more than just Baltimore.<br><br>But say I simplified my assumptions. I cut them down to just three (X, Y, and Z), and make them less descriptive and a little more idealized about heroin dealers<sq> motivations, preferences, and constraints. My theory would not be nearly as descriptive.  But I would hopefully be able to explain a substantial portion of price volatility with three assumption instead of ten.<br><br>Let<sq>s say that in this scenario the ten assumption model explains 85<percent> of the price volatility whereas the three assumption model explains only 65<percent>.

The three assumption model doesn<sq>t explain as much, but each assumption has more explanatory power, and the model can more likely be applied to other cities (less descriptive therefore hopefully less tied to the contingent circumstances of Baltimore).<br><br>In short, there is a tradeoff between descriptive accuracy and explanatory power.

An organization called the Mujaheddin was created as a rebellion against the Soviet puppet regime in Afghanistan. This organization was financed and supplied by the United States under the Reagan administration. Following the withdrawal of the USSR from Afghanistan, the Mujaheddin failed to create a united government in Afghanistan, and the organization disbanded into several different factions. <br><br>A man named Mohammed Omar created a new extremist political movement out of the ashes of the once united Mujaheddin called the Taliban. The Taliban went on to fight their way into power in Afghanistan, established a regime, and the rest is history. <br><br>Meanwhile, over in Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden began recruiting Mujaheddin fighters and other extremists to expand the mission and operations of the Mujaheddin across other fronts of Islamic fundamentalist fighting around the world. Eventually, Al-Qaeda sought refuge in Afghanistan and became closely aligned with the operations of the Taliban, but the two remained affiliated but distinct organizations. Al-Qaeda continued to expand their operations, and today have closely affiliated extremist organizations in places all over the world which makes Al-Qaeda a pretty expansive and powerful organization, even though the base organization has been largely weakened as a result of the 2001 War in Afghanistan.<br><br>Thus, the biggest difference between the two organizations comes down to the focus of their missions.

Like a lot of psychology, we can<sq>t exactly point to a parts of the brain that are responsible for this, so it ultimately all these things seem to be to boil down to experimentation of philosophical frameworks.  I know nothing, but since nobody else is commenting maybe some of my ramblings will be able to build a better discussion by people who do.<br><br>People who are using CBT are actively learning to pay attention to, and correct fallacious lines of thought.  So, as far as I see it, we have a couple of different things we can unpack from this.<br><br>Feeling seems to be some core feature of the brain.  The role of language seems to be huge though, if not all encompassing in the actual process of thought.  Children begin life by listening to language as babies, then on to babbling incoherently, then on to talking to themselves out loud through external language, on then on to suppression of that voice which is the move towards inner dialogue.  Along the way, we learn the ability to accept and transmit complex thoughts in a more an more advanced way.  <br><br>Beyond the most core reflexes, we feel and intake what we can from our senses, and chunk it down and categorize it into symbols that we process linguistically.  But this seems to be a two way mechanism.  Orwell<sq>s 1984 really revolves around this idea, and if nothing else is a story about how the limiting of language is the limiting of thought.  Without the symbolic hook to hang an idea too, we quite literally never see it, never think it, and never feel it until someone comes along and spends a lot of brainpower creating and propagating that new hook to hang on. On the radiolab podcast, they recently explored the idea that even the seeing of color has drastically changed through human history.  New hooks are passed along to hang colors that have been there all along, but somehow missed.<br><br>We are social creatures.  Our success lies the the ability to work together, and we use language to transmit the ideas to effectively do so.  We can put ourselves in each others shoes, somewhat.  When I see someone injured on an internet video, i quite literally feel that pain.  We can even conceptualize the emotional pain of others.  If we couldn<sq>t, movies would just be a series of picture sequences.<br><br>Next we have the power of habit forming.  We all know about experiments like Pavlov<sq>s dog, or Skinner<sq>s reinforcement of behavior.  Habits seem to be created as a shortcut through the long, arduous and energy consuming process of building similar behavior over and over.  They can be base and simple push lever, get food.  But as humans we can use our symbols, our hooks, to build super complex thoughts, which allow for super complex habits as well.<br><br>At this point I think we can build a bit of a picture of how all these pieces might work together.  A kid who is constantly told that they are at the top of their class is going to internalize this and is likely to do better in school than their peers who weren<sq>t.  Our parents guide our introduction into the rules and norms of society, and a good part of that voice in your head might be an extension of their thoughts, given to you as you formed the mental faculties to deal with the world without being a fucktard.<br><br>What happens if these pieces start to work against the person?  Somewhere along the way, you take some flack for something you<sq>ve done, or maybe just some act of emotional significance was inflicted on you.  Maybe your parents were super critical when you were a kid, and growing up you begin to make the habits that tell yourself how stupid you were to make some mistake, no matter how insignificant it might be.  You<sq>re inflicting on yourself stress, self-hatred and self-doubt which are habituated and become part of who you are.  The symbols were transmitted to you, the hooks are in you, the language gets internalized, and you habituate this emotionally painful cycle which becomes part of the way you see the world.<br><br>In order to break a habit, we have to call attention to why we do it.  We have to interrupt that reason, and we have to direct that potential in a more healthy way.  This is what CBT is doing.  You<sq>re emotionally on the ropes about some task you forgot to do at work, and instead of the habit telling you how stupid you are, leading to suffering, you catch the thought and run it through a system. The system, if properly used, says that in the grand scheme of things, you will be okay.  Thinking the way you are predisposed to is not a reality which should be internalized, because look at how fallacious the idea is when you take the time to examine it.  Now imagine the stress load that is lifted when all these compounded thoughts start unraveling.  Stress has the potential to drive us forward, or to cripple us with depression or anxiety of unchecked emotions, which feed the need for more of the same.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Long story short<colon> like a lot of complex social phenomenon, there is no short answer. <br><br>[Some longitudinal evidence](http<colon>//journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=517240&fileId=S0021932005027173) suggests that victims of sexual abuse are more likely to become perpetrators themselves. Although the effect is comparatively small and most victims do not go on to become perpetrators. So this is obviously not the single answer to account for the phenomenon as a whole. There may also be intervening factors here. For example, children born to substance abusing mothers are [more likely](http<colon>//archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=516969) to be maltreated, and children who have been maltreated are at [increased risk of substance abuse](http<colon>//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0145213489900719). So it<sq>s easy to argue that substance abuse may be the key factor and not the sexual abuse itself. It is well accepted though, that there is a [genetic predisposition](http<colon>//psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/112/1/64/) for substance abuse independent of other factors. <br><br>So unsatisfactorily, we can say that history of abuse, family history of substance use, and the association between substance use and abuse, interact in a complex way to affect the level of risk. <br><br>It goes without saying that in the case of the scandal in the Roman Catholic Church, [the institutional response](http<colon>//historicalpapers.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/historicalpapers/article/download/39474/35796) or lack thereof, as well as the [power relationships](http<colon>//www.jstor.org/stable/25746148) have been blamed. Put differently, weeds grow best in fertile soil, and the environment may have magnifying or diminishing effects on perpetration. <br><br>[Others](http<colon>//sax.sagepub.com/content/7/4/301.short) have argued that the phenomenon is a misfiring of adaptive evolutionary conditioning that doesn<sq>t work so well in a modern setting. Arguments from evolution can be very convincing, but are basically rhetorical. That is, they can be difficult to impossible to put to the test, and, in theory, you can construct multiple and even contradictory evolutionary <dq>just-so<dq> explanations for the same phenomenon. <br><br>You also have to consider potential differences between legal and societal definitions of abuse as compared with therapeutically meaningful ones. For example [most males](http<colon>//informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00048679809062736) do not consider abuse by women perpetrators as harmful. Some may assert that this is evidence of a social bias against men as perpetrators and that women should be treated equally harshly as they are both <dq>abuse<dq> by the legal and societal definitions. But you could easily argue that the victim<sq>s perception of victim-hood is vital in determining whether they are in fact a victim. <br><br>Depending on local laws, <dq>consensual<dq> sexual contact between a 16 year old and an 18 year old may be considered child sexual abuse. However, it is easy to see how the competency and ability to consent is much more similar between a 16 and 18 year old than it is between a six year old and someone who is 40. In a nutshell, you have to look very carefully at how abuse is defined and how data is gathered. At the same time there is no arguing with [evidence](http<colon>//www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Paedophilia<percent>20<percent>20<percent>20Policy<percent>20And<percent>20Prevention.pdf#page=15) that sexual abuse is broadly harmful. <br><br>So the real answer is the same unsatisfying one you get with a lot of complex social science questions<colon> the evidence suggests that it is some combination of biological predisposition, environmental factors, pathology, institutional/societal factors, and...well...probably something else we haven<sq>t considered yet. As a general rule, in social science, if you get a short, simple and deeply satisfying answer to your question; they<sq>re probably oversimplifying things. <br><br>*edit 2<br>Thank you for the gold stranger, but don<sq>t too gracious.

My own understanding is that my idea of individual and familial <sq>codes of honor<sq> in the west and west comes about from the depiction of various honorable persons in a variety of places; books, movies, TV shows. In these depictions, the honorable persons are always in a seemingly lawless environment. So, the persons rely on themselves to produce a Just society. In these cases, I think codes of honor are like self accepted laws which affect nearly every facet of social interaction.<br><br> I think in the past, in the west and various places, many people relied on a mutual understanding of a sort of code of honor in much the same way we rely on laws or contracts today. In the absence of a stable and competent government places may still recognize a code of honor. In some cases, as with duels, it seems to me to be a way of settling disputes when in the absence of a mutually trusted court. It may be that in a feudal system one would have to justify one<sq>s actions not by their adherence with the law, but through their adherence with a code of honor. Now, I think that in developed and stable countries with a powerful and trusted justice system/court system, there is no need to appeal to a code of honor in a great many matters. Of course, there are some aspects, like politeness, chivalry, and such, which carry over from codes of honor but are not written in law.    <br><br>I think that in places like Japan, codes of honor are still very much remembered as a part of their cultural heritage and their lingering impact still affects many social interactions. I think that in the U.S.A., because of its extreme diversity, codes of honor are much less influential or useful and so they are not recognized or appreciated so much. <br><br>Also, I don<sq>t think many instances of suicide in Japan could really be considered Seppuku ([Wikipedia says their have only been 6 in the last century](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku)). I also don<sq>t think that the caste system is a good example of honor code (unless I have a completely different understanding than you), because it<sq>s more of a social structure instead of something one uses to justifies actions. Honor killings in the middle east may be a good example but I don<sq>t know enough about them to say anything. <br><br>TL;DR<colon> I think Codes of Honor developed in many diverse cultures as a way of producing justice in the absence of strong governments. I think that some places still either don<sq>t have strong governments, or still feel that early codes of honor are a part of their culture. <br><br>Also, I didn<sq>t address the different cultural understandings of how individual honor is connected to familial honor (if it is). <br><br><br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>On a theoretical level it would make a lot of sense for there to be differences between countries of different sizes. For example, there are cultural arguments. Nordic countries are small and homogenous, this means they are more like their countrymen, and thus trust them more and are more generous with their welfare systems. There are a lot of Americans, they are very diverse bunch. This makes them more distrustful of each other and this makes them less inclined to spend their tax dollars on someone thousands of miles away. There are also economic arguments, that larger societies simply cannot sustain welfare states which is often invoked on reddit. But none of this is found in the data. In other words, even if it makes sense on paper, the size of the country does not seem to effect (social) policies. See Rose<sq>s <dq>Size Really Doesn\u2019t Matter<colon> In Search of a National Scale Effect<dq> for a more in depth look. <br><br>That said, political institutions to influence outcomes, and I would argue that that would be the biggest hurdle for the Americans to develop a Nordic style welfare state is its federal nature. The US government is relatively decentralised and has a lot of checks and balances. In many European countries a simple majority in parliament is enough to create a new healthcare program. In the US? There needs to be a majority in the House, a super majority in the Senate (due to filibuster rules), the president needs to sign the bill and the Supreme Court needs to find it constitutional. Then in some cases the states need to implement it as well (see the Medicare expansion that was part of Obamacare, which not all states agreed to). <br><br>What does this mean? Since it is more difficult to implement and change policy, change away from the status quo will usually be pretty small and piecemeal. The only time big changes occur is in times of crisis, when all actors agree something does indeed have to change. The last time such a crisis occurred on the scale large enough to facilitate the creation of a <dq>social democracy<dq> was either in New Deal era of the aftermath of the Great Depression or in the aftermath World War 2. Some change did occur in the direction of social democracy, but because the US political process is slow and deliberative (because it requires so many actors to agree), these programs were never as all encompassing as their European counterparts.<br><br>It should be noted that this slowness is by design; checks on power are incredibly important and part of every single functioning democracy. They are just stronger in the US than in Europe. It also means these social programs are harder to dismantle; in European countries it is  possible to dismantle social programs more quickly because of the same speediness of the political process that allowed them to be implemented in the first place.<br><br>Sources<colon><br>Nathan, Richard P. <dq>Federalism And Health Policy.<dq> http<colon>//content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/6/1458.full. 2005.<br><br>Obinger, Herbert et al. <dq>Federalism and the Welfare State.<dq> http<colon>//www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/political-economy/federalism-and-welfare-state-new-world-and-european-experiences. 2005.<br><br>Rose, Andre K. <dq>Size Really Doesn\u2019t Matter<colon> In Search of a National Scale Effect.<dq> http<colon>//faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/arose/Size.pdf. 2006.<br></p>",

There are no easy answers when it comes to integrating a culturally distinct group into any given society. I<sq>m sure someone with a more sociology-oriented background could present the current research on the matter, but this answer is meant to demonstrate the situation for one particular group<colon> Italian immigrants to the United States arriving in the immigration wave of the 1880s.<br><br>Italian immigration in the US prior to 1920 was characterized by the creation of single-ethnicity <dq>ghettos<dq> in various urban centres, esp. on the East coast^1. The Library of Congress page on the subject of Italian immigration^2 around 1880 claims that, unlike previous Italian immigration<colon><br><br>> This new generation of Italian immigrants was distinctly different in makeup from those that had come before. No longer did the immigrant population consist mostly of Northern Italian artisans and shopkeepers seeking a new market in which to ply their trades. Instead, the vast majority were farmers and laborers looking for a steady source of work\u2014any work. There were a significant number of single men among these immigrants, and many came only to stay a short time.<br><br>(This is not unlike the demographics of Middle-eastern immigrants arriving by sea into Europe, as per UNHCR<sq>s numbers^3)<br><br>These Italian immigrants were driven in large part by poverty, violence, and social upheaval in post-unification Italy^2. Initial reactions to this wave of immigration was mixed - one famous cartoon from Puck shows the cartoonist<sq>s discontent with immigrants taking American jobs^4, while another shows them to be violent hoodlums who were better off drowned in a cage^7. Manhattan<sq>s <dq>Little Italy<dq>, as one of the <dq>points<dq> of the Five Points (affectionately referred to by the New York Times as <dq>America<sq>s First Slum<dq>), was claimed to be rife with violence and prostitution by the press at the time, in part due to its large Italian population^5. <br><br>Indeed, as Donna R. Gabaccia notes in <dq>Inventing <sq>Little Italy<sq><dq>, <dq>[Little] Italy was from the very moment<br>of its birth a crime scene<dq>, albeit <dq>its crimes were those of drama and passion among immigrants.<dq>^6 This is not to say that organized crime was not a significant problem, as the various Italian mobs (e.g. the Genovese) that arose from that time demonstrate^8. For a long time since the Italian immigration wave in 1880, Italian-Americans were inextricably linked to organized crime in the popular imagination^8. This stereotype had very real consequences, which were exemplified by the New Orleans lynching of 11 Italian-Americans in 1891. The nativist crowd, believing the Italians to be guilty of the assassination of a police chief, ignored the jury verdict acquitting the alleged murderers on the basis that they were tied to the mafia (which was never demonstrated)^9.<br><br>How did this generation of allegedly insular, violent criminals become integrated into American society? This is difficult to answer definitively, but this^10 article from the Washington Post alleges two primary causes<colon><br><br>> Congress passed immigration quotas in the 1920s that primarily targeted people from Southern and Eastern Europe. The Immigration Act of 1924 slashed the annual quota for Italian immigrants from more than 42,000 to less than 4,000. Stemming the flow of newcomers into ethnic neighborhoods caused Little Italys to gradually shrink, and Italian Americans moved to the suburbs and diverse neighborhoods where they were more influenced by purely American music, movies and culture. <br><br>> [...]<br><br>> Then came World War II, which forged a strong feeling of national unity \u2014 one that was more inclusive than the nativist campaign for \u201c100 percent Americanism\u201d during World War I. At the beginning of the war, Italian immigrants who had not become U.S. citizens were deemed \u201cenemy aliens.\u201d But President Franklin D. Roosevelt determined that the designation was counterproductive as he sought Italian American support for the war and lifted it on Columbus Day 1942 , so Italians largely escaped the fate of interned Japanese Americans. A half-million Italian Americans (including Berra, who earned a Purple Heart) served in the U.S. military during World War II, with some of them fighting in the Italian countryside that had been their parents\u2019 home.<br><br>>As they joined the military and integrated into suburbs, Italian Americans shed the popular stereotypes surrounding them. Gradually, the customs developed in Little Italys found acceptance in the mainstream and were absorbed into broader American culture.<br><br>Again, this is meant to be purely demonstrative, not prescriptive. Furthermore, the answer in the Washington Post is only one of many - the scholarly consensus is more mixed and would be more appropriate as the subject of a masters thesis.<br><br>[1] https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Italian-American_neighborhoods<br><br>[2] https<colon>//www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian3.html<br><br>[3] http<colon>//data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php<br><br>[4] https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States#/media/File<colon>Immigrants1888.jpg<br><br>[5] http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/books/the-first-slum-in-america.html<br><br>[6] <dq>Inventing Little Italy<dq>, Donna R.

If you want to only count opinions from the powerful and ignore the opinions of the downtrodden, then yeah, it was only later, due to a variety of factors, not principally World War ii but due to concerted efforts by activists for generations, that led to that a large majority of people started to see it as bad.  That is, if what you<sq>re asking is when did the majority of white people see racism as bad, you<sq>d have to go to the 1990s, I<sq>d say. It was only in 1994 that a majority of Americans were ok with interracial marriage, meaning the majority were still uncomfortable with the idea of people of different races being equal<br>enough to marry, until that year. <br><br>Franz Boas was involved in showing people that racism had no scientific basis, but saying he was the turning point for convincing people that racism was bad can only be said by someone who has only read Franz Boas on this topic. There were many many many many others working on these same issues at that time and in the many decades before that time. To attribute it to Franz Boas is to insult all of the others working hard in many disciplines to expose the evil and non-scientific foundations of racism. From Frederick Douglass to W.E.B. DuBois to all the people at the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, and on and on and on. <br><br>As for anyone not WASP (white Anglo-Saxon Protestant) being <dq>not white<dq>, that<sq>s a canard that I see repeated again and again and again. All of the  ethnically European immigrants were considered to be <dq>white<dq> in the US. Were there many who considered non-WASPs to be inferior to WASPs and people whose families had been in the U.S. for generations? Yes. But that<sq>s not the same as not being considered to be white. There were no laws passed against them because of their ethnic origins. They were allowed in public schools. Jim Crow did not apply to them. Were they not allowed to have membership in certain clubs? Yes. Might a blue chip firm not hire them because they weren<sq>t a WASP? yes. In the case of Jews, there were restrictions at elite colleges, too. There were prejudices against them of various sorts in certain cases, yes, but they were still considered to be white and were accorded many of the privileges inherent in the US of not being a person of color.

The financial crisis has weakened the c.2007 consensus somewhat - the much-vaunted policy models weren<sq>t able to analyze large financial panics. There is serious lack of data in macro, and an equally serious lack of good identification techniques (what natural scientists would recognize as <dq>natural experiments<dq>), which makes inference difficult.<br><br><br>>   The proliferation of divisions of macro in the public policy sphere can be attributed to politics, lack of data, the public debate lagging the academic literature, etc.<br><br><br>>   The public lags the academic literature; that<sq>s fine.

                "answer": "<p>I had the privilege of seeing Alex Tabarrok, an economist from GMU, give a presentation on innovation. <br><br>He has made the argument that patent laws and innovation follow a similar relationship to tax rates and government revenue, as demonstrated by the [Laffer Curve] (http<colon>//i.investopedia.com/inv/dictionary/terms/laffercurve.gif). That is, that patent laws (measured by patent strength) increase innovation up to a certain point of efficiency, and past that point of efficiency they decrease innovation. <br><br>Calling it the [Tabarrok Curve](http<colon>//marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/06/the-tabarrok-curve-in-the-wsj.html), he agrees that protection of intellectual property (patents) is useful in promoting innovation by guaranteeing that hard earned intellectual innovations will be protected by property rights. But he also argues that past a certain point innovators will start to use patents in a socially costly way. That is, they will use patents as a defensive measure.<br><br>For example, under the first-to-file law, a competitive firm has the ability to claim and purchase patent rights to a certain product that their competitor is developing and tuck it away. They have no intention on developing the product themselves, just keeping it away from their competitor. <br><br>Here is a fictitious example<colon> Google can purchase the patent rights to a certain software development that Yahoo is working on. So long as Google claims the rights first, they legally own the software development. Google will then have the ability to prevent Yahoo from coming out with the development and keep a competitive advantage. <br><br>The result is bickering in lawsuits, wasting time, money, paper and intellectual pursuit. <br><br>The point is, that at a certain point, patent laws become too restrictive. Yes they are useful, but as most things in economics, there is a point of diminishing returns. <br><br>So to answer your question, economic activity would slow to a halt with no patent laws. BUT patent laws that are too numerous and complex (as many believe they are) do the same to economic activity, as explained by the [Tabarrok Curve](http<colon>//www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/09/InnovationStrengthCurve32.png).</p>",

I have read one economist who casually remarked that <dq>it was really hard to imagine and persuade people to get rid of patents today. But it would be equally impossible to persuade people to adapt the current system if we did not have patents at all in the first place<dq>.<br><br>We have internalized the necessity of patents, but I would like to say, though I am not for completely removing them, their benefits are extremely overrated and their necessity is mostly exaggerated. Patents are not vital for innovation, most inventors would not just go and spend their time on useless stuff if we removed them (there are people who claim it is patents alone driving innovations). Mokyr does not attribute historical importance to patents when he explains technological progress, industrial revolution, why some nations are more innovative...etc in his book. ( http<colon>//www.amazon.com/The-Lever-Riches-Technological-Creativity/dp/0195074777) Without patents inventors would still benefit, but probably less. But I would claim many inventors are being harmed by previous patents as well, so it is not easy to say they would benefit less in case we removed them. First inventor always have market power, so without patents there would still be profits to be harvested. There are a couple of industries that seem to need patents (pharma); but even there there are alternatives (public prizes). Besides drug companies already benefit from public research immensely as well, so public prizes for drugs may not be the worst idea after all. <br><br>The biggest problem with patents is that they inhibit further growth because of existence of imperfect information, transaction costs and bad patent system (that rewards really broad patents). Maskin and Bessen have a paper that looks into sequential innovation case and claim that patents are likely worse than having no patents; and in their model with duopoly it actually hurts even the inventor by inhibiting further discoveries and the potential benefits to firms from the value they would get from those future inventions (innovations create value or surplus in economy, from which firms harvest some as profits! If APple still produced iphone1, their sales would tank by now, and they would earn less and less profits )<br><br>http<colon>//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2009.00081.x/abstract<br><br>There are many other papers, but they essentially say <dq>too much is bad, too little is likely bad<dq>. I think we are at <dq>too much<dq> part of patents since 1981, and there is a growing concensus apparently say so. For example, right now, Software and Business practice patents are just ridiculous. And another ridiculous thing is every single patent, regardless of industry has the same duration. 19 years in pharma is barely sufficient for drugs that cost close to one billion to develop. 19 years is ages in software industry, where ideas are really cheap to develop (compared to many other industries). Usually you don<sq>t even have to code. You can get a patent for a process you come up with e.g. automatic uploading of pictures to cloud when you connect an SD card to computer. This is an idea that I came up with as I typed this, but also I am pretty sure already patented. But as you can see I did not spend even 100 dollars to develop the idea. <br></p>",

The papers made a splash when they were published like four years ago, and this month two major critiques were published in one of sociology<sq>s two flagship journals about them.  Here are two threads from the Soc Job Rumors, academic sociology<sq>s 4chan<colon> [Saperstein/Penner debate in AJS](http<colon>//www.socjobrumors.com/topic/sapersteinpenner-debate-in-ajs) about the new critiques and earlier thread [Gelman jumps on Saperstein&Penner](http<colon>//www.socjobrumors.com/topic/gelman-jumps-on-sapersteinpenner) (which features appearances by both one Saperstein<sq>s co-authors explaining and defending a different <dq>racial fluidity<dq> paper, and of the main critics of the AJS paper arguing that there<sq>s no deceit, this is just how science/social science works).

I<sq>m not a native English speaker. <br><br>**Preliminary remarks**<br><br>First, it<sq>s hard if not impossible to say something about an individual, because psychology and related fields usually find effects by looking at averages. I<sq>m also not very familiar with the events. In what follows, I<sq>ll assume Roger was morally competent, and use his case an example for a more general model.<br><br>Second, it<sq>s impossible to say what would have happened (independent of X). Such [counterfactuals](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_conditional) presuppose certain causal assumptions to be true. For instance, anybody saying that <dq>he would<sq>ve been a murderer anyway<dq> claims to know what caused the violence. Nobody knows this for sure. Experiments can establish causality, but we can<sq>t run experiments for historical events. Therefore, it<sq>s impossible to say what truly caused this tragedy.<br><br>Third, what we do know is that people with mental health problems (ignoring psychopaths) almost never become violent because of their illness. We know this because we can ask people with mental health problems who did violate the law. Their justifications \u2013 ie. reasons \u2013 are in fact just like the ones you get from healthy people. Often, they say they were justified doing what they did. One<sq>s moral faculties are usually not effected by metal health problems (again, ignoring psychopaths), just like one<sq>s visual faculties are usually not affected. In other words, people with, say, autism see just fine. Their moral faculties appear to work just fine, as well.<br><br>**A basic model**<br><br>That said, here a very simple model why some people become violent. This doesn<sq>t cover all the bases, but I<sq>d say it<sq>s the most relevant to cases like Roger<sq>s. Basically, it<sq>s a two-step procedure<colon><br><br>1. Anger is the result of moral expectations that are violated.<br>2. Violence is the result of anger given the right circumstances.<br><br><dq>Moral expectations<dq> here means that one expects others to treat one the <dq>right<dq> way. For instance, if you<sq>d pay an 8 dollar bill with a 10 dollar note, you expect the cashier to give you 2 dollars back. If he or she would violate your expectations, you<sq>d probably get angry (sometimes also called moral outrage). In other words, you feel entitled to get 2 dollars back. You have a right to the money.<br><br>Whether you<sq>d react violently (or not) depends on the circumstances. If he<sq>s 6<sq>3 with shoulders like a tank, you<sq>ll probably suppress your anger, redirect it elsewhere, or you try a different course of action. If he<sq>s a small guy with cheap glasses on his nose, however, you might try to <dq>teach him a lesson<dq>. In other words, people generally consider violence justified in the form of punishment. <br><br>Unfortunately, there<sq>s an ongoing debate what the <sq>right<sq> circumstances actually are. We just know that not every angry person becomes violent, so there must be some additional necessary conditions. I don<sq>t have a good typology or taxonomy of circumstances, yet. However, having power is presumably one of these conditions (in some religious narratives, anger (and punishment) is a prerogative of the gods). The lack of an alternative course of action is probably another condition.<br><br>Another example of the right circumstance is when two people (or members of two coalitions) violate each other<sq>s moral expectations, thereby creating a spiral of punishment and counter-punishment. Violence tends to escalate, or, to use Martin Luther King<sq>s phrase, <dq>violence begets violence<dq>.<br><br>These are <dq>normal<dq> moral reactions \u2013 normal in the sense that humans probably evolved to feel that way. What may not be obvious is that people differ (sometimes a lot) with respect to their expectations. Some people<sq>s expectations are above average, so to say. I believe [Hoffer (1951)](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_True_Believer) was the first to emphasize this. [Baumeister (1999)](http<colon>//www.goodreads.com/book/show/573611.Evil) uses the term <dq>egotism<dq>. [Pinker (2011)](http<colon>//www.goodreads.com/book/show/11107244-the-better-angels-of-our-nature) classifies this under <dq>dominance<dq>, IIRC.<br><br>Just in case you hadn<sq>t noticed<colon> Anger is *the* warning sign for violence.<br><br>From what Wikipedia reports, Elliot Roger<sq>s case fits the model. He expected others to treat him in a certain way, and he considered this reasonable and justified. These moral expectations were violated repeatedly, by different transgressors (from his perspective). It<sq>s not unusual to generalize in such situations, treating others as if they were members of a antagonistic coalition (or group).<br><br>Surprising (from a layman<sq>s perspective) are just his relatively high expectations, on the one hand, and his construction of the antagonistic coalition, on the other.<br><br>Some of the members of communities like Redpill, or MRA  fit the model<sq>s first step, too (see eg. [Flood (2004)](http<colon>//www.xyonline.net/content/backlash-angry-mens-movements-0) for some observations). They act as if their supposedly reasonable and justified moral expectations are violated, and they show obvious signs of anger about that. Some commentators call this misogyny, but I would argue they have the burden of proof. Some Redpill and MRA members also show signs of generalization, and treat others (ie. women, or feminists) as if they were members of an antagonistic coalition.<br><br>For what it<sq>s worth, it seems, some of today<sq>s feminists fit the model<sq>s first step, too (see [Hoff Sommers (1994)](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Stole_Feminism<percent>3F) for some observations). They expect a certain treatment and feel these supposedly reasonable and justified moral expectations are violated. They show signs of anger (what some commentators call misandry, but, again, I<sq>d argue they have the burden of proof). And they show signs of generalization and treat others (ie. men or MRAs) like members of an antagonistic coalition.<br><br>In contrast to Roger<sq>s case, however, both feminists and MRAs are supposed to be (or think of themselves as) a coalition.<br><br><br>**The influence of narratives**<br><br>I<sq>ll use the term narrative because it<sq>s a bit less judgmental than ideology, in my opinion. The term narrative captures stories we tell ourselves about the life of others, and the stories that others tell about their lives. It<sq>s also the stories the media tells. Add explicit norms and ethics and the law, and you get culture.<br><br>Narratives affect the model above in two ways<colon><br><br>1. They influence and determine our moral expectations.<br>2. They influence and alter our interpretation of the <sq>right<sq> circumstances.<br><br>The first point should be obvious. Our brains are predisposed to integrate into an existing social structure, so one<sq>s moral expectations are derived from these narratives, and the roles we see ourselves playing. This process happens implicitly (subconsciously) but explicit considerations can change one<sq>s expectations, too.<br><br>Unfortunately, it can also go wrong. One reason for this is presumably that different narratives contradict each other. Most are also ambiguous. Additionally, some exist on different <dq>plains<dq>, because we<sq>re often members of multiple coalitions at the same time.<br><br>I don<sq>t think particular narratives found in the Redpill or MRA communities played a major or relevant role in Roger<sq>s case. His expectations were already high, and, from what I can tell, already violated several times. The process of escalation was already under way.<br><br>But just because it probably played no role in Roger<sq>s case doesn<sq>t mean it plays no role in anyone<sq>s case. We do know that groups tend to become more <dq>extreme<dq>. Possibly, this could raise the moral expectations for at least some members, leading them to be come angrier still.<br><br>It<sq>s less clear how narratives influence or alter our perception of the right circumstances. For instance, being a member of a coalition might create the impression of power, raising the chances that someone becomes violent. On the other hand, coalitions might also lower the chances for violence by providing an alternative course of action.<br><br>The reason why not every member is affected the same way (and therefore not every member becomes violent) is that moral expectations not the same for every member, and members also differ concerning their interpretation of circumstance.<br><br><br>**Final remarks**<br><br>You may have noticed that I didn<sq>t answer some of your questions directly. This is because I think they are based on incomplete or misleading assumptions. Hopefully, I managed to convey that actions like Roger<sq>s can be explained without any resort to metal illness. Since the model applies to many different situations (from mere dishonesty to crime to terrorism, revolutions or even war), it<sq>s probably the better starting point.<br><br>I also hopefully managed to convey that anger is a sign for violence. It<sq>s neither a necessary condition (there is such a thing as instrumental, <dq>rational<dq> violence), nor is it sufficient (because not every angry person becomes violent). However, it<sq>s the most obvious sign. People become frightened or fearful when others are angry, suggesting that this has an evolutionary basis which wouldn<sq>t be there if anger had no adverse effects on reproduction.<br><br>And contrary to folk psychology, the hydraulic model of anger (ie. <dq>letting off steam<dq>) is not accepted anymore. It rather looks as if letting yourself be angry merely lowers any existing inhibitions towards aggression and violence, see [Bushman, Baumeister & Stack (1999)](http<colon>//www-personal.umich.edu/~bbushman/bbs99.pdf). The fact that Elliot Roger (as well as all the people around him) based their actions on some intuitive, folk psychological understanding of the situation may have been the most influential factor for this tragedy.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>",

Many of these killers suffer from mental illness (do note that many are not judged to be psychotic when they actually commit the crime) - off the top of my head, 95<percent> sure the Aurora shooter was schizophrenic, which is more common in men than women. Antisocial personality disorder is also relatively common in mass killers, and again more present in men than women. Do note that it<sq>s pretty hard to get good data on this, as the people who perpetrate these massacres usually don<sq>t survive. Furthermore, most killers, especially adolescents, rely upon having access to firearms, and white people are relatively more likely to own guns than non-whites.<br><br>There<sq>s also, however, arguments from the psyche of these killers. One way to examine mass shooters is as a subset of murder-suicides, since, again, most shooters do not survive nor expect to survive.

These leave some people feeling very powerless and angry at the world, and taking up a gun happens to be a very quick way to take that power back. <br><br>And, if it interests you, [this paper](http<colon>//www15.uta.fi/arkisto/aktk/projects/sta/Leary_Kowalski_Smith_Phillips_2003_Teasing-Rejection-and-Violence.pdf) brings out a whole another set of massacre case studies, primarily those committed by adolescents. </p>",

One could argue that the reasons that there are so few female serial killers is that 1. we\u2019re socially blind to it so they get away with it better or 2. due to sexism and internalized feelings of powerlessness that society trains many women to have, they don\u2019t end up feeling as if the world is as malleable to their will.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>The language being used here comes from radical feminist and race study thought, but the end goal for all people is to feel entitled to use public space as if they own it, free of prejudicial or prescriptive treatment within that space. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Anyway, the major concept to come away from this with is<colon> Entitlement is a concept that is indoctrinated into people who grow up as part of the power majority in a country.  As an entitled person, you expect to have your way, at least eventually.  You resent contrary evidence to the righteousness of your thoughts and actions. Entitlement grants you the confidence that your wisdom has accounted for all the nuance.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now, to the Aronson article.  This article talks about the the process to transform from an everyday citizen into an environmental activist.  The major step that needs to occur, is that the world needs to demonstrate that it does not give a fuck about what you want.  You need to feel betrayed by the systems around you in order to go through a \u201creformation.\u201d  These betrayals can be cases of obviously cronyism, bad journalism, slander campaigns that get personal against you, or legal shenanigans to steal your voice.  You need the system to betray you in order for you to solidify and become an agent that is now capable of seeing injustice.  Nothing squashes your confidence like having a rich developer poison your well and get away with it.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>My leap of faith here is making the cross comparison between these two subgroups.  But, generally speaking, it will comport with the evidence I\u2019m showing to demonstrate at least some internal consistency.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>To become a spree killer, from a standpoint of a person who has no other mental health phenomena occurring, you need to have your surroundings betray you.  This betrayal needs to be personally profound.  For non-whites in america, there is no betrayal process necessary to become an environmental activist<colon> the very nature of systemic racism gives them no such belief in the justice of the system (this is supported in the aronson article and many other anthro-studies of race and environmental activism).  So, back to whitefolk, these entitled men feel betrayed when circumstances in their life align to demonstrate unequivocally that they are not actually entitled to anything whatsoever.  Statistically, they are more likely to experience this per capita (have entitlement), and therefor are more likely to develop a reformation around it.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>The reformation can be positive; taking accountability for actions and inactions.  The reformation can be mildly negative; smokes a lot of weed, doesn\u2019t really engage the system.  The reformation can be strongly negative, where the killer convinces themselves that they themselves are worthless, therefor unable to affect society, and then all the blame lands on the \u201cidiots\u201d who don\u2019t see the wisdom of the person, so now they have to pay, starting with the woman who wronged them most recently.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>From there, it is a numbers game for why, per capita, there are more white spree killers in the US.  And when you look at the manifestos of these folks, there is a long incubation period.  Sometimes they subscribe to a worldview that just makes things worse for themselves, (Elliot Rodgers, anyone?)<br><br><br><br><br><br>This theory has some neat experimental cues around it.  Does the number of privilege factors affect the likelihood of committing the crime?  Most interestingly, does socio-economic class play a factor.  It is an entitlement cushion, and if it falls away, the reformation is likely to be more potent.  Does anyone have stats for lifetime income level and serial killers per capita therein? And if so, is it statistically normal when you pick it apart by race?<br><br>Edit<colon> cleaned up a bit.</p>",

There are things like different types of speech errors which are common at certain ages and not at others. However generally by 10 years of age a child<sq>s dialect is fairly uniform and internally consistent, which is not the case for, say, a 6 year old. Citing a paper by Labov for those numbers which was written on English acquisition, but it appears to be pretty consistent cross linguistically. A 16 year old in one language will have approximately the same level of ability to express complex ideas as a 16 year old from another language background but equivalent socioeconomic background.<br><br>So, for your first question, the answer is a qualified <dq>no<dq>.<br><br>Writing is another matter, and harder to address because there<sq>s a lot of cultural influence on how written language is taught. A good example is [Japanese children learning Chinese characters](http<colon>//www.textfugu.com/kanji/kanji-intro/1-2/) (kanji), which are not taught by simplicity of character form, but rather how basic the meaning is. That is to say, the complexity of number of strokes doesn<sq>t at all reflect the order in which they learn the characters. Same is basically true for Chinese, but it<sq>s less relevant since it<sq>s the primary system of writing in that case. On top of that, the level at which a newspaper (for example) is written in English is not the same as the level at which a newspaper is written in Chinese or Korean. There<sq>s a tendency to use a higher degree of specialist vocabulary as compared to a paper like USA Today (edit<colon> source added to follow up comment re variance in newspaper traditions by country). This makes it harder to compare level of written proficiency and reading proficiency across languages. There are of course studies on literacy, and there have been focused efforts by governments to simplify or make more uniform the writing system in order to help improve literacy, but this is also hard to judge objectively because there are so many other variables that affect literacy such as economic development and with it an increase in average education level.<br><br>Still, the answer to the second question is <dq>no, but it<sq>s kinda hard to really know, but still probably no<dq>.<br><br>Kids here (China) do a *lot* of rote practice of characters and proper stylistic form for writing with a brush.

We also put together [the most comprehensive database on veteran suicides](http<colon>//backhome.news21.com/interactive/suicide-interactive/) to date and in the process I interviewed a number of veterans, VA doctors, psychologists, social workers, family members, and so on. I<sq>m not an expert but I do feel like I can answer your question.<br><br>A few things to clear up first<colon><br><br>* The high rate of veteran suicides is due in part to the demographics of the veteran population. Veterans are more likely to be male, white, older, have access to a gun, etc. - all of those factors are correlated to a higher incidence of suicide. It<sq>s hard to compare veteran suicide rates to the civilian rates because you have to control for those factors, which we weren<sq>t able to do (though we did make our dataset publicly available if anyone wants to do their own analysis). That said, there<sq>s little doubt that veteran status can play a significant role in predicting suicidal behavior in an individual. <br><br>* Just because a veteran committed suicide does not necessarily mean that his or her military service had anything to do with it. People commit suicide for a variety of reasons, and there is a tendency among a lot of commentators and journalists to automatically draw a line between their prior military service and their suicide. Point is  <br><br>* There<sq>s some evidence (there are a couple studies I can dig up if I can find the time) that individuals who have pre-existing mental health conditions are more likely to join the military, so you may have a self-selected population of people who might be more prone to commit suicide to begin.<br><br>* If I remember correctly, the rate of suicide is highest among veterans between the ages of 35-44 and above the age of 60. This kind of makes sense; people hit <dq>mid-life crises<dq> in the first bracket, and are approaching the end of their lives in the second bracket. The aging veteran population is ballooning in those age groups (WoT veterans and Desert Storm veterans in the first bracket, Korea/Vietnam veterans in the second).<br><br>All of this is to say that your pet theory isn<sq>t really correct or incorrect, you just can<sq>t attribute one umbrella reason for why veterans commit suicide. Some veterans I spoke with feel the same way you do; some don<sq>t.      <br><br>If military service plays a role in making someone more likely to commit suicide, I *think* it boils down to this, which you touch on<colon> in military culture, it<sq>s difficult for soldiers and veterans to talk about their feelings and what they<sq>re going through for a variety of reasons, which makes it harder to see potential warning signs and red flags. My personal impression is that great strides have been made in recent years in implementing better mental health care programs for soldiers and veterans (still a long ways to go, though) and among the Iraq/Afghanistan veterans I spoke with, there is a greater recognition than other generations of veterans that it<sq>s okay to reach out when they need help. <br><br>I hope I answered part of your question and I hope that all made sense.

                "answer": "<p>There is a correlation between higher population/better communication and the rate of cultural evolution, but the former does not cause the latter; they are both byproducts of other societal changes. Major Roman cities actually had large, dense populations, yet clothing styles remained relatively constant for centuries (the <dq>fashions<dq> they experienced were in accessories and embellishments, like jewellery). Another counterexample would be China or Japan, pre-modernisation. <br><br>There are a few theories about how quickly and dramatically fashion has changed in the last couple of centuries relative to the past. Most point to industrialisation as a key factor, not only increasing wealth and creating a status-conscious middle class, but also introducing new technologies and materials. [Lipovetsky<sq>s](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Lipovetsky) theory is very class-centric, attributing the beginnings of the phenomenon to the bourgeoisie<sq>s desire to emulate the upper classes, who responded by <dq>dressing down<dq> in an inconspicuously luxurious way. This continued until the counter-cultural movement, which birthed a plurality of fashions. As traditional social hierarchies broke down, people sought to differentiate themselves through individualism such that we no longer see the consistent and seemingly prescribed silhouettes of decades past. <br><br>Because of the subjective and interactionary nature of culture, it is obvious difficult to quantify. First we would need to define what constitutes <dq>culture<dq>. Here you seem to use it to refer to fashion, art, recreation, etc. but these are influenced by fields like linguistics, politics, science, and economics, which are also subject to trends and <dq>being in fashion<dq>. The studies on this topic tend to focus on a specific cultural segment and demographic. ([Here is a paper whose content may not be useful, but contains a wealth of citations.](http<colon>//www.soc.ucsb.edu/ct/pages/JWM/Papers/Four<percent>20Ways<percent>20to<percent>20Measure<percent>20Culture/Four<percent>20Ways<percent>20to<percent>20Measure<percent>20Culture.pdf)) If you are interested in a certain area, I can offer suggestions on approach. For example, fashion<colon> starting with [Charles Worth](http<colon>//www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wrth/hd_wrth.htm) (who is widely credited as the first <dq>fashion designer<dq> by virtue of affixing labels bearing his name to garments), compile a list of new fashion houses and companies up to present day. You can organise further by number per time frame, country of origin, sales, international presence, etc. depending on the direction of your research. Surveys are also a very popular method of data collection for anthropological/sociological questions, but I<sq>m not sure if they are helpful here.<br></p>",

Even when controlling for who draws the maps and their varied strategic interests, we do not find any support for the argument that gerrymandering is decreasing electoral competition.<br><br>and theyre not alone. campagna and grofman looked at redistricting and the resulting legislatures in the 80s, and found that<colon><br><br>> a gain in seats may require a more efficient distribution of voters across districts in order to attempt to capture these newly formed districts, while a loss in seats may lead to more competitive races immediately following a redistricting due to incumbents being forced to face another incumbent as a challenger... further, or perhaps alternatively, a partisan gerrymander may be constructed in order to win a number of districts by small margins. such a strategy increases the number of competitive seats and thus increases the swing ratio.<br><br>that pdf can be found [right here](http<colon>//search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=cookie,ip,cpid&custid=s7324964&db=aph&AN=9012312188&site=ehost-live&scope=site). gerrymandering isnt exactly a magic button that political parties can press to never face an electoral challenge ever again. in order to create districts where they think they have a better chance, parties also wind up creating districts where they dont, combining districts where their own incumbents are already elected, or maybe even making districts where high party affiliation leaves them facing challengers in their own party primaries - as was the case for some tea party representatives. <br><br>ofc, there are *some* partisan gains going on, the question is to figure out what they are. for that, heres gelman and king, 1994 (pdf [here](http<colon>//www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/democracy2.pdf))<colon><br><br>> it is true that bipartisan redistricting produces as high levels of responsiveness and lower levels of partisan bias than partisan-controlled redistricting plans. moreover, democratic- and republican-controlled plans have very different consequences for the parties. [...] these results provide good reason to support a proposal to require bipartisan control of all redistricting processes. if a legislature is incapable of forging a bipartisan agreement, then alternating, or randomly assigned, control of redistricting would also accomplish many of the same benefits.<br><br>in addition, they found that the party in control of partisan redistricting gets (on average) 6<percent> more seats. *but* they still conclude that partisan redistricting is a lot better than no redistricting; the difference in partisan bias between the districting plans of either party is about 2<percent> - which isnt really a whole lot. and because redistricting in general increases responsiveness, its not a bad thing.<br><br>now, what about incumbency? a lot of bros are gonna tell you the same<colon> voters *like* their own representatives, so they vote for them even when the general level of congressional approval is hella low. but can it be that gerrymandering has little effect? check it out<colon><br><br>> Our results show that changes in redistricting have actually reduced the success rate of incumbents quite steadily over the past century.<br><br>which is from friedman and holden, *the rising incumbency rate*, 2009, [pdf](http<colon>//research.economics.unsw.edu.au/richardholden/publications/hf_jop_09pdf.pdf), and thats supported eg. in mccarty, poole and rosenthal, 2009 [pdf](http<colon>//www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pe_10_07_mccarty.pdf)<colon><br><br>> Despite the increased ingenuity and sophistication of gerrymanders, numerous constraints and obstacles impede using redistricting as an \u201cincumbency protection\u201d plan. The requirements of equal population, compactness, and contiguity reduce the scope of such manipulation. Because many states have relatively few districts, gerrymanderers often lack the flexibility to create distorted districting plans. Legal requirements such as majority-minority districts may exacerbate polarization.<br><br>and persily 2002 [pdf](http<colon>//search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=cookie,ip,cpid&custid=s7324964&db=aph&AN=8735505&site=ehost-live&scope=site) declares<colon><br><br>> popular incumbents are the ones who seek reelection and deter potentially strong challengers from running. what appears at first glance to be incumbent entrenchment is partly explain as self-selection by risk-averse candidates. conversely, high-quality challengers often bide their time until a seat becomes open or an incumbent becomes vulnerable. thus, popular incumbents rarely square off against the types of candidates who might pose a credible threat...<br><br>creating districts to gain an electoral advantage *does* maybe seem to work, sort of, to the extent that a party can expect to gain on average 6<percent> more seats than it would have if it controls the districting plan. but that doesnt mean those seats are <dq>safe<dq><colon> representatives still have to be responsive to their constituents or face primary challengers from their own parties and marginal voters who will compromise on ideological positions if they feel poorly represented.<br><br>but shit bro, thats just a handful of papers, all of which you can read (for free!) yourself. and uh... idk about the last two questions? because i kinda disputed the whole thing to begin with, i kinda have no answer for you there. oops.<br></p>",

I<sq>ll try to answer some of the points you raise.<br><br>Although there are 1.2-1.5 Billion Muslims in the world, not all of them will make it and most will only go once in their life time. The numbers are increasing every year and it is a huge challenge logistically now that travel is easier as compared to before.<br><br>With regards how the local authorities deal with it,I have been told by family members that the local authorities although not perfect they are remarkably organized and they have the yearly experience. The Saudi gov. has made design changes to the holy sites so that more people can come and visit and in a safe manner. This includes more accommodation, better travel facilities and also better routes so the sacred practices can be made in a quick and safe manner.<br><br>The Saudi gov. has also given certain Hajj visa quotas to each country in the world, esp. the Muslim ones so that it is a fair balance and also a measure to prevent a huge influx of visitors in the season. This way the Saudi authorities will know roughly how many people will come and thus prepare accordingly.<br><br>With regards to the actual Hajj it self, although it is a pillar in Islam, if you can not afford it, or if you have debt or you are unwell, then you are definitely not obliged to go. <br><br>One interesting point you make about the millions of people that gather in one place is that one of the goals of Hajj is that people of all walks of life from different cultures and colours all meet and great each other. Many friendships have been created this way that lasted a life time. In fact religious tradition encourages that you greet your fellow person conducting Hajj and engage in friendly dialog, all this to promote a sense of unity and humanity.<br><br>It is also a time to reflect that no matter how rich or poor you are, we are all equal in the eyes of God. To symbolize this equality, everyone wears the same simple cloth, whether billionaire or a poor, black or white, all will wear the same. We will all die and in the hear-after we will come back to face our maker and the only thing that will have bearing is our conduct in our life time not how rich or important we were.<br><br>The process is a wonderfully spiritual affair, esp. if the Muslim in question prepares in advance and reads and asks on how to best conduct the Hajj. Many converts to Islam who went to Hajj not only loved it but found that it changed their lives for the better.<br><br>I am sure others will be able to answer more than this, also there are many videos online that explain the process itself and what it means for Muslims.<br><br><br>Edit<colon> Spelling.</p>",

Autor is notable here has he has massively advanced our understanding of the interaction between technology &amp; labor over the last couple of decades, he posits automation as an extension of the Skill-Biased Technological Change hypothesis which represents manageable inequality changes (this is wage inequality, labor/capital shares remain stable but there is a clear divergence between types of labor actors) but no structural employment issues. The absence of structural employment is expected based on the way we understand technology to act on labor, as a productivity multiplier, and even if the SBTC hypothesis turns out to be incorrect this does not imply structural employment but rather a different form of inequality.<br>* [Why Do New Technologies Complement Skills?](http<colon>//economics.mit.edu/files/3809).

Built on the prior paper to examine some of the productivity effects in a simple tech &amp; non-tech worker model. While some inputs to their model do produce a result which suggests a reduction in labor demand their conclusion is that the likely outcome is the other kind of inequality (declining labor share) but again with a clear policy solution, they also have alternative policy solutions for avoiding the unlikely scenario of net labor demand falling.<br><br>>Beyond this there is a huge split between technologists &amp; economists regarding what automation means in the future of labor, the recent [Pew expert survey](http<colon>//www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/08/Future-of-AI-Robotics-and-Jobs.pdf) is a good example of this effect with economists concentrated on the disruption but not displacement side and technologists on the displacement side. Perhaps economists are wrong (we do use AI too though, I run an agent based system in Mahout and other forms of simple-complex AI are equally as common in other dynamical systems work) but the split certainly suggests either economists have a global misunderstanding or there are effects non-economists are not considering.<br><br>>More generally we argue [historically automation has not reduced employment](http<colon>//www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_eKbRnXZWx3jSRBb). Automation has historically acted as a multiplier on productivity which drives demand for human labor. Pre-singularity its very hard to imagine this changing, we will undoubtedly encounter disruption effects (people will have the wrong skills, their earnings will reflect this matching issue rather then unemployment doing so) but from an economics perspective there is little difference between replacing a field worker with a tractor and an office worker with an algorithm. Certainly the office worker needs to find a new job, if they don<sq>t have demanded skills that job may not offer earnings growth opportunities but it doesn<sq>t imply unemployment anymore then the mechanization of agriculture did.

(1) The increasingly strong position of the peasantry during the preindustrial period which was connected with (2) The weakening position of the landlords and the power-holding aristocracy as a result of domestic crises and international conflicts thorough which Scandinavia (3) became a peripheral area in economic and political terms (Alestalo 1986, 11-12; Alestalo and Kuhnle 1987).<br><br>> The historical inheritance of the Nordic countries is that of fairly small class, income, and gender differences. The Scandinavian route towards the modern class structure was paved with the strong position of the peasantry, the weakening position of the landlords, and with the peaceful and rather easy access of the working class to the parliamentary system and to labour market negotiations. This inheritance is seen in small income differences and in the nonexistence of poverty (Ringen and Uusitalo 1992<colon> 69-91; Fritzell & Lundberg 2005<colon> 164-185). Moreover, Scandinavia is famous for her small gender differences...<br><br>> The beginnings of the modern Nordic welfare states can most meaningfully be traced to the last decades of the 19th century. As elsewhere in Europe, this development was at a general level associated with growing industrialization and urbanization, but also with the political innovation of large-scale social insurance schemes introduced in the German Reich during the 1880s (i.e. nation-building and state-formation)....<br><br>> Quite remarkably, the first major social insurance laws in the Nordic countries were passed at about the same time, in the course of five years, 1890-1895, in Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, and Denmark as the only Nordic country introduced more than one law, altogether three, during the 1890s. Iceland introduced an old age pension (means-tested benefits) law, which was a moderation of the poor law, in 1890 (Olafsson 2005); Denmark a law offering benefits to \u2018respectable\u2019 old people in 1891, and a law on subsidies to voluntary sickness funds in 1892, and an employers\u2019 liability act for cases of industrial accidents in 1898; Sweden introduced subsidies to voluntary sickness funds in 1892; Norway passed an industrial accidents insurance law in 1894, where employers were obliged to finance insurance for their workers; and Finland introduced its first law on semi-compulsory industrial accident insurance in 1895. The striking simultaneousness in terms of timing cannot be depicted as a historical coincidence, and can only to some extent be explained by indicators of socio-economic development and political democratization. ...<br><br>Much more at the link. The basic idea is that social democracy thrives in Scandinavia partly because of political culture (emphasis on consensual governance, social cohesion) and partly due to the way history unfolded.

We derive the optimal top tax rate formula as a function of the three corresponding behavioral elasticities. The first elasticity (labor supply) is the sole real factor limiting optimal top tax rates. The optimal tax system should be designed to minimize the second elasticity (avoidance) through tax enforcement and tax neutrality across income forms. The optimal top tax rate increases with the third elasticity (bargaining) as bargaining efforts are zero-sum in aggregate. We provide evidence using cross-country times series macro-evidence and CEO pay micro-evidence. The macro-evidence from 18 OECD countries shows that there is a strong negative correlation between top tax rates and top 1<percent> income shares since 1960, implying that the overall elasticity is large. However, top income share increases have not translated into higher economic growth. US CEO pay evidence shows that pay for luck is quantitatively more important when top tax rates are low. International CEO pay evidence shows that CEO pay is strongly negatively correlated with top tax rates even controlling for  rm characteristics and performance, and this correlation is stronger in firms with poor governance. These results are consistent with bargaining effects playing a role in the link between top incomes and top tax rates. If bargaining effects in fact exist, optimal tax rates should be higher than commonly assumed.<br><br>They suggest that taxation rates of top incomes can go up to around 80<percent> without having large negative effects on economic growth.<br><br>[Here<sq>s a WaPo article](http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/business/for-economists-saez-and-piketty-the-buffett-rule-is-just-a-start.html?pagewanted=all) about this work.

Of these homicides, few are committed with a gun, with the UK coming in a 0.04/100K (vs. Canada 0.5, and US at 10.3) **[2] (http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)**. So there may not be a perception of a lot of guns causing problems that would require guns to combat them.<br><br>Further, another factor would probably be how often police feel outgunned. In the UK there were only 3 police officers killed by firearms in England and Wales in the span between 2000 and 2011 **[3] (https<colon>//www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116483/hosb0212.pdf)**. Compare this to the US where in 2012 alone, 43 law enforcement officers were killed with a firearm **[4] (http<colon>//www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2012-preliminary-statistics-for-law-enforcement-officers-killed-in-the-line-of-duty)**. Indeed, a 2006 poll of the Police Federation (which is, as far as I can tell, the union representing many lower level police officers) found 82<percent> of them in favor of keeping the routine ban on **[5] (http<colon>//www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19641398)**.<br><br>Finally, another consideration is that this is a political decision and not an empirical one. Given the UK<sq>s long tradition of firearm restrictions **[6] (http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Gun_control_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom)**, it would seem as an electorate they are far more comfortable with strong restrictions on firearms. When it comes to police though it seems that public opinion is largely split **[7] (http<colon>//www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19641398)**, so maybe there<sq>s some room to move there. Finally, as policy makers, we<sq>d also have to consider the enormous costs that this change would bring. We<sq>d have to buy the firearms, buy them regularly due to use and defects, ditto ammo, continually train officers, handle the increased load that shooting inquiries would take, and probably have to pay more for insurance due to a whole new avenue for lawsuits, etc.</p>",

Many of the black residents there can trace their roots back to slave plantations that probably aren<sq>t too far from where they live now. <br><br>Agriculture isn<sq>t exactly a huge money maker. If you [check out this map](http<colon>//visualizingeconomics.com/blog/2007/08/11/united-states-poverty-map), you<sq>ll notice that rural areas where agriculture dominates generally have the most poverty. Farmers can make a decent living, sure, but the people who actually work their farms don<sq>t (not to mention farmers tend to hire undocumented immigrants on the cheap). <br><br>The Delta is a pretty extreme example. Since so much of farming has become automated and mechanized, it has severely limited job opportunities in the area. Casinos were legalized in the state back in the 1990s which has brought money into the Delta, but conversely, poor people tend to be the worst gamblers. Let<sq>s not forget about racism, too. There is still a lot of latent racism in Mississippi, which can make it difficult for poor blacks to get ahead. Despite all of this, the Delta area receives a lot of federal funding, which has boosted real income by a bit over the past 20 years. <br><br>The most important factor is education. Mississippi schools suck. The students in the Delta who do well and go to college often leave the state, contributing to a pretty bad <dq>[brain drain](http<colon>//timmask.com/blog/?p=164)<dq> problem. There just aren<sq>t a whole lot of good jobs for college-educated people in the Delta. <br><br>When your most educated people are leaving the state it leaves a huge developmental void. You need college educated people to start businesses, invest money, or become licensed professionals. Those people drive local economies. Corporations tend to flock to areas where there are huge talent pools - places like Silicon Valley or Austin/Houston/DFW. So there<sq>s no incentive to move to Mississippi when it<sq>s right between economic powerhouses like Texas and Atlanta. <br><br>The Delta is particularly poor because of all of these things.

If there are 500 million English speaking people who will pay for content (or who advertisers will pay to reach), and 80 million German speakers, a movie that appeals to 10<percent> of the German population only need appeal to 2.5<percent> of the English-speaking population. The types of art that will appeal to 2.5<percent> of the population are much more numerous than the types of art that require 10<percent> of the population to be sustained.<br><br>Second<colon> Agglomeration effects and economies of scale*. Certain types of art thrive by being done at a place where other types of that art are being done. Obviously, if I want to make a movie the cheapest place to produce it will be Hollywood (filming it is a different question), because there are people and equipment there who specialize in making movies. Need an editor for your screenplay? In Hollywood you could probably find one in the phonebook; but probably not anywhere else. Similar effects lead to Hollywood having great advantages over other locations--even shows set in NYC or DC will be shot in LA. <br><br>To compare, almost 90<percent> of carpet in the world is produced in or around Dalton, Georgia. Why? Agglomeration effects make it so that it is cheaper to make carpet in GA and ship it to Moscow than it is to make carpet in Moscow. Why is most of your carpet made in Dalton? No really good reason, it just happened someone started making carpet there and it snowballed. Hollywood, to some extent, can be explained by that. It could have been Vancouver, or London, and then Americans would consume a lot more Canadian and British culture.<br><br>Note<colon> the arguments apply to other art forms than movies, just to a lesser extent. Why, if I consume postmodern literature, is most of it from Paris? The community of writers that developed there was a resource in production unique to Paris. <br><br>*Agglomeration effects mean that if someone is producing X at a certain location, it becomes cheaper to produce X at that location. It<sq>s cheaper to write good software in Silicon Valley than the middle of nowhere, because Silicon Valley has programmers and an infrastructure that a software company requires. Land may be cheaper in BFE, but internet and programmers aren<sq>t. In addition, you<sq>re more likely to run into someone at the bar who has good ideas about software that you can then benefit from in Silicon Valley than in rural nowhere. <br><br>Economies of Scale indicate the range of production where average cost is decreasing. It<sq>s cheaper per-meal for me to make 4 servings for dinner than it is for me to make 2 servings, because there are a lot of fixed costs when I go to make dinner that are paid regardless of the number of servings.

                "answer": "<p>Unfortunately, I don<sq>t think there<sq>s good data on this.  I know of two nationally representative surveys of Muslims.  The first, conducted by the Pew Forum, was published in 2007 as <dq>Muslim Americans<colon> Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream<dq>.  The second, conducted by the Pew Research Center, was published in 2011 as <dq>Muslim Americans<colon> No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism<dq>.  (The Pew Forum focuses on religion and public life; the Pew Research Center on U.S. politics)  Neither asked questions about Sunni or Shi<sq>a opinions on one another.  But we can get *some* sense from the other questions asked.  While the respondents mostly identify with a tradition (65<percent> Sunni, 11<percent> Shi<sq>a), another 11<percent> specifically volunteered something general (e.g. <dq>just a Muslim<dq>) and 15<percent> gave a different group (Sufi, Ahmadi, etc.) or chose <dq>don<sq>t know<dq>.<br><br>If we associate poor Sunni-Shi<sq>a relations with extremism, we wouldn<sq>t expect them here based on the relatively few worries American Muslims have about extremism. In the first survey, 61<percent> and in the second survey 60<percent> of American Muslims were <dq>very<dq> or <dq>somewhat<dq> concerned about the possible rise of extremism among American Muslims.  The second survey asked more detailed questions, like How much support for extremism is there among American Muslims? 6<percent> say <dq>a great deal<dq>,  15<percent> say <dq>a fair amount<dq>, 64<percent> <dq>not much<dq> or <dq>not at all<dq>.  Only 4<percent> of American Muslims say that Muslim extremism is increasing in America.  Nearly half (48<percent>) also thought that American Muslim leaders hadn<sq>t done enough to speak out against extremism, while about a third (34<percent>) thought they had done all they should.  So what you see is that American is Islam isn<sq>t really associated with the sort of extremism you<sq>d expect to see associated with the very factious fighting you currently seem in parts of the Middle East and Pakistan (and to a lesser extent, other places). <br><br>Further, American Muslims seem to have embraced pluralism roughly in line with their neighbors of other religions.  When asked, <dq>Which religion leads to eternal life?<dq>  Only 34<percent> of American Muslims believe that only Islam leads to eternal life, while 56<percent> say <dq>many religions<dq> do.  While this doesn<sq>t deal *directly* with the Sunni-Shi<sq>a split, it shows the broad pluralistic acceptance of the American Muslim community.  As a comparison, almost the same proportion of American Christians (30<percent>) say that <dq>only Christianity<dq> leads to eternal life.  Among Evangelical Christians specifically, 51<percent> say <dq>only Christianity<dq> can lead to eternal life, while 45<percent> say <dq>many religions<dq> can (among <dq>high commitment Muslims<dq>, by the Pew<sq>s reasoning, the numbers are similar<colon> 52<percent> vs. 39<percent>).  So broadly speaking, at least on this rather specific sort of question, American Muslims are about as pluralistic as American Christians.  <br><br>While the question isn<sq>t addressed specifically, from the questions we do have answered, I think broadly we see no reason to suspect that Sunni-Shi<sq>a relations in America would be particularly fraught.  I<sq>m sure there are specific cases where there might be *local* tensions and divisions that fall along sectarian lines, but there are probably many other local tensions and divisions that break along other lines (cf. /u/john_the_fisherman<sq>s article).  I<sq>m Jewish and we have an old joke that a man needs two synagogues<colon> one in which to pray, to find a community in, to raise his children in, and to grow old in; one to never set foot in so long as he lives.  On the national level, however, I can<sq>t think of any place where there are parallel sectarian institutions.  Most major national Muslim institutions in America (Muslim Student Associations; CAIR and other advocacy groups) seem to have a Sunnni dominant leadership (with leadership generally being immigrants or the children of immigrants, though there are some converts as well, like Ibrahim Hooper and Mahdi Bray) but this reflects Muslim demographics nationally.  Off the top of my head, I can<sq>t bring to mind any parallel national, specifically Shi<sq>a institutions, which you<sq>d expect if there were tension rather than overall cooperation between American Sunnis and Shi<sq>as and Shi<sq>as felt a strong need for their own leadership.</p>",

For instance, the majority of Muslims live in Asian, not in the NENA (Near East, North African) countries, although the latter is probably more prominent in Western minds than the former. They are also rather different culturally. Anyways, \u2026<br><br>1. What you consider tolerant (liberal, moderate) is probably not the default state for humans. For evidence, see [Steven Pinker<sq>s <dq>The better angels of our nature<dq>](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature). It makes more sense to ask how the West managed to become more liberal than most other countries.<br>2. Part of what<sq>s <dq>normal<dq> for humans is being religious. [Ara Norenzayan in <dq>Big Gods<dq>](http<colon>//www.religiousstudiesproject.com/2014/03/05/an-outline-of-norenzayans-big-gods-by-michael-doane/) mentions four main causes, but for your question it<sq>s sufficient to mention just one of them<colon> Misfortune (as I call it) bothers people very much. To answer the resulting <dq>why<dq> questions, all humans seem to believe in something supernatural, and thus religious.<br>3. These above two are the background of the times when the Koran and the Hadith were written. These texts basically <dq>froze<dq> the moral development at that time which contains conservative as well as liberal elements (and quite a bit of <dq>Realpolitik<dq>, see [Robert Wright<sq>s <dq>The evolution of God<dq>](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_God), chapter 16 and 17).<br><br>That said, here<sq>s some major causes<colon><br><br> - Misfortune due to a lack of social security nets. This is also (one of) the reason why the U.S. is so religious among Western nations. People offering superstitious explanations (eg. <dq>Your misfortune is due to letting immoral people live amongst you!<dq>) are more influential than necessary.<br> - Nepotism, corruption, and lack of trust in the government. This means, there<sq>s still a strong honor system because it<sq>s rational to sometimes be irrational when the arm of the law is weak.<br> - Tribalism combined with history. Victims have long memories, and when people are members of coalitions, it<sq>s easy to become a victim, since humans \u2013 for some reason \u2013 consider it <dq>just<dq> to punish one member of a coalition for the crimes of another member. For instance, there<sq>s evidence that Muslims in the NENA region still think about the injustice of the crusades (see [Destiny Disrupted](http<colon>//books.google.de/books?id=4rgTr0W32-kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tamim+Ansary&cd=3&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=&f=false) by Tamim Ansary, for instance). In such situations, violence can also escalate, leading to misfortune. There<sq>s another side effect of people endorsing (moral) positions to be different to outsiders. That means, there<sq>s a chance that some Muslims endorse a conservative position on some questions because the European West doesn<sq>t.</p>",

(For theories about the decline of the second Klan, see Kelly Baker<sq>s excellent summation in *The Gospel According to the Klan*). However, there was no such thing as Neo-Naziism at this point, so it is difficult to generalize about a singular Klan position on neo-Naziism. That being said, let<sq>s move on to neo-Naziism.<br><br>In the US, the largest neo-Nazi movement was George Lincoln Rockwell<sq>s American Nazi Party (ANP). (But neo-Naziism, like the Klan, lacks a clearly defined center!) There was considerable overlap, at times, between the ANP and the Klans. For example, Simonelli describes [David Duke as a disciple of Rockwell.](http<colon>//books.google.com/books?id=KAU2E4fFC10C&pg=PA143&dq=a+Rockwell+disciple&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HmdPUeWDDqLi2QWGzoCoBQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=a<percent>20Rockwell<percent>20disciple&f=false) But Duke eventually left both movements in order to mainstream himself and get elected to office in Louisiana. However, there were Klansmen who detested Naziism, and denounced Klans for supporting the ANP. For example, Imperial Wizard Robert Shelton of United Klans for America, who was a pivotal figure in the United Klans of America, denounced another member, William Fowler, of the united Klans for standing with Rockwell at a rally<colon><br><br>>[The Klan stands for Christianity and decency, the Klan stands for this great country of ours, the Klan stands for the rights of the White Man...but never should we be accused of needing the Nazi storm troopers to get our message across to the American people. And what of these uniformed storm troopers who stand alongside our <dq>Klan representative<dq> at this rally, wearing the swastika of the Nazi Party. Needless to say, fellow Klansmen, these are the followers of the crooked George Lincoln Rockwell, the psychopathic agnostic who laughs at the name of Christ. Rockwell is great when it comes to playing boyish tricks, but have you ever noticed that it is not Rockwell himself who performs these publicity seeking stunts. Oh no, it is always some poor lame-brained nut who performs for the <dq>Commander<dq> and who sites in jail while the <dq>Commander<dq> quietly counts his money and dreams of new worlds to conquer....

Klans and Neo-Nazi groups evangelized parts of Europe and sought to hold united rallies in the United States. Ridgeway discusses this in his *Blood in the Face*. Moreover, the book inspired the documentary of the same name. The film is available for streaming on Netflix and even [YouTube](http<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfPx-f5Mpo4), for your viewing pleasure(?). However, as I mentioned, the Klans and the neo-Nazi groups are still rather discordant. So, while there are Klans and neo-Nazi groups that work together, there are still many that hate the others. It should be mentioned that one of the things that separates the two groups is religion. The Klan is a Christian organization, and there is a fair number of neo-Nazi groups that adhere to [paganism](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Gods-Blood-Pagan-Revival-Separatism/dp/0822330717/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1364159634&sr=8-5&keywords=gods+racism).<br><br>Edit<colon> this is not to insinuate that everyone on the right is racist, or that the right is the only side of the political spectrum with a race problem. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I doubt there is any published evidence of a sport to patriotism correlation, as that would be too vague of a study to publish. However, you can easily find more specific correlational studies. [For example, researchers at California State University surveyed 1,048 Americans in the summer of 2003 to demonstrate the existence of a \u201cmasculinist sport\u2013militaristic nationalism correlation\u201d that contributed to the support  of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.](http<colon>//jss.sagepub.com/content/30/1/79.short).<br><br>Noam Chomsky often speculates about the relationship between national sports and mass political disengagement/Blind Nationalism. Here<sq>s a section from his pushied work entitled <dq>Understanding Power<dq><br><br>*That<sq>s an interesting one, actually I don<sq>t know all that much about it personally, but just looking at the phenomenon from the outside, it<sq>s obvious that professional sports, and non-participation sports generally, play a huge role. I mean, there<sq>s no doubt they take up just a tremendous amount of attention.*<br><br>*In fact, I have the habit when I<sq>m driving of turning on these radio-calling programs, and it<sq>s striking when you listen to the ones about sports. They have these groups of sports reporters, or some kind of experts on a panel, and people call in and have discussions with them. First of all, the audience obviously is devoting an enormous amount of time to it all. But the more\u3000striking fact is, the callers have a tremendous amount of expertise, they\u3000have detailed knowledge of all kinds of things, they carry on these extremely complex discussions. And strikingly, they<sq>re not at all in awe of the experts - which is a little unusual. See, in most parts of the society, you<sq>re encouraged to defer to experts<colon> we all do it more than we should. But in this area, people don<sq>t seem to do it - they<sq>re quite happy to have an argument with the coach of the Boston Celtics, and tell him what he should have done, and enter into big debates with him and so on. So the fact is that in this domain, people somehow feel quite confident, and they know a lot - there<sq>s obviously a great deal of intelligence going into it.*<br><br>*Actually, it reminds me in some ways of things that you find in non-literate or non-technological cultures - what are called <dq>primitive<dq> cultures - where for example, you get extremely elaborate kinship systems. Some anthropologists believe these systems have to do with incest taboos and so on, but that<sq>s kind of unlikely, because they<sq>re just elaborated way beyond any functional utility. And when you look at the structure of them, they seem like a kind of mathematics. It<sq>s as though people want to work out mathematical problems, and if they don<sq>t have calculus and arithmetic, they work them out with other structures. And one of the structures everybody has is relationship of kinship -- so you work out your elaborate structures around that, and you develop experts, and theories, and so on. Or another thing you sometimes find  in non-literate cultures is developments of the most extraordinary linguistic systems<colon> often there<sq>s tremendous sophistication about language, and people play all sorts of games with language. So there are puberty rites where people who go through the same initiation period develop their own language that<sq>s usually some modification of the actual language, but with quite complex mental operations differentiating it - then that<sq>s theirs for the rest of their lives, and not other people<sq>s. And what all these things look like is that people just want to use their intelligence somehow, and if you don<sq>t have a lot of technology and so on, you doother things.*<br><br>*Well, in our society, we have things that you might use your intelligence on, like politics, but people really can<sq>t get involved in them in a very serious way - so what they do is they put their minds into other things, such as sports. You<sq>re trained to be obedient; you don<sq>t have an interesting job; there<sq>s no work around for you that<sq>s creative; in the cultural environment you<sq>re a passive observer of usually pretty tawdry stuff; political and social life are out of your range, they<sq>re in the hands of the rich folk. So what<sq>s left? Well, one thing that<sq>s left is sports-so you put a lot of the intelligence and the thought and the self-confidence into that. And I suppose that<sq>s also one of the basic functions it serves in the society in general it occupies the population, and keeps them from trying to get involved with things that really matter. In fact, I presume that<sq>s part of the reason why spectator sports are supported to the degree they are by the dominant institutions.*<br><br>*And spectator sports also have other useful functions too. For one thing, they<sq>re a great way to build up chauvinism-you start by developing these totally irrational loyalties early in life, and they translate very nicely to other areas. I mean, I remember very well in high school having a sudden kind of Erlebnis, you know, a sudden insight, and asking myself, why do I care if my high school football team wins? I don<sq>t know anybody on the team. They don<sq>t know me. I wouldn<sq>t know what to say to them if I met them. Why do I care? Why do I get all excited if the football team wins and all downcast if it loses? Anti it<sq>s true, you do<colon> you<sq>re taught from childhood that you<sq>ve got to worry about the Philadelphia Phillies, where I was. In fact, there<sq>s apparently a psychological phenomenon of lack of self-confidence or something which affected boys of approximately my age who grew up in Philadelphia, because every sports team was always in last place, and it<sq>s kind of a blow to your ego when that happens, people are always lording it over you.*<br><br>*But the point is, this sense of irrational loyalty to some sort of meaningless community is training for subordination to power, and for chauvinism. And of course, you<sq>re looking at gladiators, you<sq>re looking at guys who can do things you couldn<sq>t possibly do - like, you couldn<sq>t pole-vault seventeen feet, or do all these crazy things these people do. But it<sq>s a model that you<sq>re supposed to try to emulate. And they<sq>re gladiators fighting for your cause, so you<sq>ve got to cheer them on, and you<sq>ve got to be happy when the opposing quarterback gets carted off the field a total wreck and so on. All of this stuff builds up extremely anti-social aspects of human psychology. I mean, they<sq>re there; there<sq>s no doubt that they<sq>re there. But they<sq>re emphasized, and exaggerated, and brought out by spectator sports<colon> irrational competition, irrational loyalty to power systems, passive acquiescence to quite awful values, really. In fact, it<sq>s hard to imagine anything that contributes more fundamentally to authoritarian attitudes than this does, in addition to the fact that it just engages a lot of intelligence and keeps people away from other things.*<br><br>*So if you look at the whole phenomenon, it seems to me that it plays quite a substantial social role. I don<sq>t think it<sq>s the only thing that has this kind of effect. Soap operas, for example, do it in another domain ? they teach people other kinds of passivity and absurdity. As a matter of fact, if you really want to do a serious media critique right across the board, these are the types of things which occupy most of the media, after all - most of it isn<sq>t shaping the news about El Salvador for politically articulate people, it<sq>s diverting the general population from things that really matter. So this is one respect in which the work that Ed Herman and I have done on the media is really defective - we don<sq>t talk about it much. But this stuff is a major part of the whole indoctrination and propaganda system, and it<sq>s worth examining more closely. There are people who<sq>ve written about it, Neil Postman and others - I just don<sq>t feel enough acquaintance with it to say more.*<br><br>Chomsky source - https<colon>//thewellwroughturn.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/chomsky.pdf<br></p>",

Biologically race (grouping people by skin color) is an outdated and inaccurate way to group the mammal homo sapiens sapiens.  Its about the same as grouping people by hair color or freckle count, people with more/less freckles don<sq>t have significantly different levels of intelligence, domestication, athletic skills, etc...  However, there are socially constructed race lines which people react to every day and effectively make real.  In /r/asksocialscience race is correctly discussed as a real thing because it falls under what [Social Science](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science) measures, that is relationships among people in a society.  But in /r/askbiology the idea of race was long ago proven inaccurate, incorrect and is no longer discussed.  Im throwing the US government under the bus for this, its quite unfortunate that they continue to ask people about their race when doing its census and job applications which has resulted in pseudo-scientific measurements on race continually being passed around as relevant. <br><br>To put that in perspective imagine bringing up religion in an honest discussion about physics, you will get you laughed out of the room.  But bring up religion in an honest discussion about Social Science and we can go for days.  We aren<sq>t done, here is the point, in both of those situations we see different reactions to the same dataset (religion).  But, neither of them are actually concerned with proving religion true/false, they are each concerned with their own disciplines.

Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971 (pp 136\u2013179). Chicago, Aldine.)*<br><br>The idea is based on the observation that human children have a relatively long period of development between birth and self-sufficiency, at least 10 years. During much of that time, children are relatively helpless and parents must care for them.<br><br>Biologically, high parental investment equates to a potentially high cost to cheating. Males become concerned with female cheating, because of the threat of raising a child that is not ones own (i.e. being cuckolded). Females become concerned with male cheating because the father of her children may get distracted by having offspring with another woman (i.e. his parental investment gets shared with another woman<sq>s children).<br><br>And so, the idea goes, if a human imposes a social stigma on his or her partner when it comes to cheating, all other things being equal that person will maintain an advantage when it comes to securing parental investment for their young. This pressure acting over time results in this anti-cheating stigma thriving in the general population.<br><br>The fact that birth control technologies now separate sex from reproduction, has not yet had time to affect our evolved mental tendencies.</p>",

A good place to start if you want more thorough answers though is the [History of Sexology Sourcebook] (http<colon>//www.amazon.com/History-Sexuality-Sourcebook-Mathew-Kuefler/dp/155111738X).  It provides a wonderfully indexed set up for most of the questions one may have for how things were or came to be, and pointers for further reading.<br><br>One bit at a time, Jealousy is a natural feeling, and Western culture tends to encourage it, but the why is the same why as virginity, so I<sq>ll get both of them at once.<br><br>Now, virginity, this goes back to the idea of women as property, which goes back all the way to the dawn of agriculture, prehistory.  To have a woman was to have the power to reproduce, so having a woman was the most important thing a man could have.  Now, due to lack of medical advances, women could die during childbirth, and even if they and the child survived, then there was no guarantee that the baby was the son of any given person unless they were the only man who had ever had sex with her.  Virginity until marriage was pretty much just one step away then.<br><br>Virginity also comes into [several religions](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculous_births) (virgin mary from christianity for example).  Keep in mind that many people thought that the baby came from men (nevermind the egg), so a virgin birth was all the more miraculous, and any baby born from a virgin was therefore the product of some sort of divine thing.<br><br>Add in a few thousand years of religion and culture movement, and virginity is this whole thing people worry about and loyalty to ones spouse is part of being any sort of <sq>decent human being<sq>.  <br><br>So, that jealousy thing?

Pretty much the only thing they all agree on is informed consent<br><br>All this leads to the whole premarital or interracial sex things, which have completely different answers IMO.  Premarital sex goes back to the same virginity / jealousy / women as property thing I just rambled on about.  Interracial sex is a whole slew of things, from jingoism and lack of willingness to mix cultures, to racism and thinking of people as inferior and therefore taboo, to fear of spreading diseases, because different races have different frequencies of diseases as well as different immunities.  <br><br>Which, thinking of diseases, we<sq>ve understood a decent amount of how disease spreads for quite a long time, which is why even as far back as Rome they had bathhouses and methods for disposing of sewage, and why we have a natural aversion to things that look <sq>diseased<sq> to us.

So, we have a contract, a social contract if you will. We can talk about *why* I might have a desire for sexual exclusivity, and there are good answers to that, but we don<sq>t need to answer it to know that it would be wrong to cheat. Ceteris paribus, breaking contracts is wrong. Full stop. If you want to know why breaking contracts is wrong, there are a number of places to look. You could look here<colon>   http<colon>//plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/ for example. But, personally, I<sq>m a fan of Kant and his categorical imperative which would claim that since you cannot will that everyone breaks contracts as a universal law without contradiction, it<sq>s wrong.

I agreed to follow the same rules, of course, but that isn<sq>t relevant, i.e., there could be relationships out there where one partner agrees to be faithful why the other doesn<sq>t and they are both happy with the arrangement. And, of course, there are plenty of people out there who don<sq>t want to enter into any of these kinds of contracts and just want to be completely free to have sex with whoever, and that<sq>s fine to.  </p>",

Since you are talking about the 56<percent> [as in 2013 inflation](http<colon>//globovision.com/articulo/inflacion-en-noviembre-fue-de-48-y-la-de-diciembre-22) I\u2019m going to talk specifically about the last years.<br>My theoretical base is going to be the monetarist view of inflation. <br>That view is summarized in the formula<br>**MV = Py**<br>If you want an explanation of this formula i suggest you to read this fun and easy (4 times gilded) [comment](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yb2zk/where_is_the_inflation/cfj637x) <br><br>In the Venezuelan specific case we have basically two problems.<br><br>**On the supply side<colon>**<br>As you can see on the formula if you solve for P (Price) you are going to have a new formula that will state MV/y=P. Where y are the goods/services available to the citizens. Under the Chavez-Maduro administration, the nationalization-expropiation and price controls policy has limited the incentives for entrepreneurs to <dq>do their thing<dq> (i.e make stuff). In fact as you can see [here](http<colon>//eleconomista.com.mx/industria-global/2013/03/07/hugo-chavez-expropio-casi-1200-empresas-diez-anos) there have been at least 1.200 enterprises expropriated by the government in the last 10 years. Additionally [120.000 had closed since the bolivarian revolution came to power](http<colon>//www.reportero24.com/2012/05/dineroeconomia-venezuela-sin-chavez/). And worst, [scarcity levels are over the roof](http<colon>//www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-07/venezuela-inflation-hits-16-year-high-as-shortages-rise.html).<br><br>**tl;dr 1** there are not enough goods.<br><br>**On The Demand Side**<br>Now as we were speaking **MV = Py**, M is basically Money Supply, the ammount of Bolivares on our economy. If you go [here](https<colon>//www.bancomercantil.com/mercprod/site/tools/info_economica/reportes/esp/mensual/2013/Boletin_economico_septiembre2013.pdf) page 5 Graph 3 you are going to see the relation between [GDP](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) and [M2](http<colon>//www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp). So basically you can see that since 2010 M2/GDP has growth *a lot*. Why does M2 grows as a percentage of GDP you ask? well my friends it all has to do with the Bolivarian revolution. What happens is that in Venezuela we have an exchange control under which we can *buy* USD @ 6,3 Bs. Although i say buy, the reallity is that only <dq>*productive imports*<dq> or *<dq>Essential Goods*<dq> such as Food and Medicine have access to dollars at that price. I dont want to overexplain this cause this post is long enough as it is, so i just going to summarize it and say that only People on the Govt Tight-Circle has access to dollars at that price [for more on this](http<colon>//world.time.com/2014/01/23/venezuelas-currency-controls-propels-those-with-connections/).<br>Now the thing with the dollar @6,3 Bs is that the currency is overvalued, so if you measure the price of goods sold on Venezuelan soil with that exchange rate you are going to be surprised cause at that exchange rate Caracas is [the most expensive city for expats](http<colon>//www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/12/18/13/and-worlds-most-expensive-city-expats).<br>Ok, im finishing, now in Venezuela 97<percent> of all the exports (i.e Dollars) are brought to the economy thanks to PDVSA our very own oil company. Now PDVSA, a public company, is basically the financial stronghold of the revolution. What i mean is that a lot of the social programs applied by the Govt. (for example cheap food) are possible cause PDVSA sells its dollars at 6,3 Bs. If PDVSA sold its dollars at another price lets say, 20 Bs then the imports (food for example) would cost a lot more (i.e 1 USD for a tuna is right now 6,3 Bs, but could be 20 Bs).<br>With that in mind, If PDVSA has to sell its dollars at 6,3 how can it pay to the oil sector employees a decent salary?, well PDVSA picks up the phone and ask the CENTRAL BANK, could you please lend me some money? Now if you know your Central Banking 101 then you know that this is a No-No. How much is that debt? well according to this [source](http<colon>//www.el-nacional.com/economia/Bs-millardos-Pdvsa-Banco-Central_0_202180066.html) USD 28.000 MM, if that number doesnt impress you let me remind you that our international reserves are [USD 21.200 MM](http<colon>//www.google.co.ve/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=reservas<percent>20internacionales<percent>20venezuela&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CCsQFjAB&url=http<percent>3A<percent>2F<percent>2Fwww.finanzasdigital.com<percent>2F2014<percent>2F02<percent>2Freservas-internacionales-cerraron-la-semana-pasada-en-21-006-millones<percent>2F<percent>3Futm_source<percent>3Drss<percent>26utm_medium<percent>3Drss<percent>26utm_campaign<percent>3Dreservas-internacionales-cerraron-la-semana-pasada-en-21-006-millones&ei=pyoNU-elL5PJsQSfhIDIAg&usg=AFQjCNFpz4tip7LGXj1oKyJQIvWRl5jLLw&sig2=AVloODtEQFTvD7w92bd1GA&bvm=bv.61965928,d.cWc)<br>One more thing, PDVSA is not the only one who knows the BCV phone number, BCV prints money for the Govt and any public enterprise 24/7.<br><br>**Tl;Dr2** Central bank prints money like it wants to run out of ink.<br><br>And that is my humble view of the causes by which Venezuela has an inflation of 56<percent>+<br><br>**TL;DR** There are not enough goods and the central bank prints too much money.<br>             </p>",

There<sq>s not as much debate in the field as you may have in mind, and most of the arguing you probably see is among lay people who haven<sq>t actually spent the time.<br><br>What debate there is is that there is a small minority in the lnguistics community which believes that it is part of a larger family called Altaic. Altaic itself started out as an idea about a potential super-family that would include Turkic and Mongolic. It later was extended by some proponents to include Tungusic.<br><br>The grouping of Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic is known as Micro-Altiac. This is controversial but not too controversial..<br><br>The problem is when you start looking at what<sq>s called Macro-Altaic which is a proposal to include Koreanic and Japonic in that. This idea of Macro-Altaic is a hypothesis which to date has not had any demonstrable support in the form of sound correspondences and other things that we look for when we<sq>re trying to determine if there<sq>s a [genetic](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_relationship_\\(linguistics\\)) relationship between langauges. <br><br>One of the biggest proponents of the hypothesis is now one of the biggest critics. The idea of a Korean-Turkish relationship is largely disregarded by the majority of historical linguists.<br><br>I wrote about this recently in another thread [here](https<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/3yemgi/why_isnt_korean_tonal/) which you might be interested in. <br><br>The majority of linguists are not really debating anything. The most widely accepted view is that it<sq>s a language isolate (Koreanic, not Korean) which **might** show some relationship to Japonic, but as yet no demonstrable evidence has been presented to convince the majority of the subfield of such a relationship. Adding to that, a lot of recent attempts to do so have been utter disasters and are widely discredited. I<sq>m not naming names but there have been a couple recent books that turned out to be pretty bad scholarship. Of the support that<sq>s been provided, much is riddled with errors and problematic conclusions being drawn, and that<sq>s even if we ignore the much more obviously erroneous works.<br><br>>My naive guess is that the Chinese influence on Japanese and Korean has made the latter two hard to classify.<br><br>Nah. This isn<sq>t an issue at all, actually. If anything the Chinese influence can tell us *more* about Korean. We have a huge number of written records of Chinese talking about Korean and Koreans talking about Chinese and Koreans talking about Korean going back hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. The influence from Chinese isn<sq>t in any way complicating the issue. But again, like I said, it<sq>s actually far less debated than you might think.<br><br>One more point<colon> The Altaic hypothesis *is* somewhat popular in Korea, but the majority of people supporting it are parroting earlier scholarship and aren<sq>t really linguists, and many of the linguists who support the idea aren<sq>t operating in any sort of up-to-date paradigm. This is still a science, after all, so any claims of relatedness need to be backed up by scientifically sound evidence.

                "answer": "<p>It *is* a huge problem, but the US has a fairly rational system of federal insurance and risk transfers, entitlement and infrastructure spending, etc. that mitigate the worst effects on the states that arise from using an <sq>external<sq> currency. <br><br>Krugman for example writes about [the 1980s Savings & Loan scandal](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis). Thumbnail summary and full audit reports [here](http<colon>//www.gao.gov/archive/1996/ai96123.pdf)<colon><br><br>>During the 1980s, the savings and loan industry experienced severe financial losses because extremely high interest rates caused institutions to pay high rates on deposits and other funds while earning low yields on their long-term loan portfolios. During this period, regulators reduced capital standards and allowed the use of alternative accounting procedures to increase reported capital levels. While these conditions were occurring, institutions were allowed to diversify their investments into potentially more profitable, but risky, activities. **The profitability of many of these activities depended heavily on continued inflation in real estate values to make them economically viable**. In many cases, diversification was accompanied by inadequate internal controls and noncompliance with laws and regulations, thus further increasing the risk of these activities.<br><br>>As a result of these factors, many institutions experienced substantial losses on their loans and investments, a condition that was made worse by an economic downturn.  <br><br>Sound familiar? <br><br>Krugman points out that [around 60<percent> of the S&L losses occurred in Texas](http<colon>//krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/what-a-real-external-bank-bailout-looks-like/), which amounted to about $75 billion in direct federal aid to that one state. Krugman points out that this aid wasn<sq>t in the form of loans that Texas had to pay back, nor did the government assume an equity stake in exchange for the aid; instead this was just an outright transfer of capital from taxpayers to banks and their counterparties in order to bail them out of terrible high-risk investments. $75 billion at the time amounted to 25<percent> of Texas<sq> total GDP. Can you imagine Germany & France agreeing to simply grant 25<percent> of Greece<sq>s pre-crisis GDP in Euros with few strings attached? Krugman remarks<colon> <br><br>>I think you can make a strong case that if Texas had been an independent country in 1986-87 it would have experienced a huge financial and fiscal crisis.  <br><br>Indeed. So why did US taxpayers & Congress agree to this massive bailout for a single state? The answer is that they didn<sq>t, or not exactly. The bailout was basically automatic, as federal depository insurance corporations and regulators like FDIC, FSLIC, FHLBB and so forth stepped in to stop the bleeding before it could spread into an even wider bank crisis and recession. Later the FTC was created to unwind the accounts of several thousand <dq>zombie<dq> banks that collapsed during the crisis. <br><br>So one answer to your question is that the US has much stronger & more effective federal insurance provisions designed to mitigate bank failures, as well as other economic (and state budget) crises. In effect, taxpayers stand behind the banks of other states, ready to bail them out should the need arise. Some point out that this backing might create a moral hazard, effectively encouraging banks to make riskier investments because they know Uncle Sam will help them out when their schemes backfire. Others respond that this is the only effective way to stop a banking & liquidity crisis before it can become a full-blown economic depression, and that in exchange for insuring the investments of private banks, taxpayers should demand more effective regulation, accounting standards and stringent lending/investment rules.<br><br>**TL;DR -** US taxpayers are in general more willing to be generous when it comes to bailing out the state budgets and local economies of other states -- or at least the structure of federal & state government (particularly for example the power the US Senate gives to small states with low populations) give them little choice. This willingness to help, and a sense of good faith in general, is somewhat lacking in the EU.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>In the past (pre-industrial/ early industrial society) the primary restriction placed on food from an economic standpoint was the amount of calories a person of means could buy more and richer food and thereby eat more calories (think Henry VIII). A poor person on the other hand would be restricted to an often largely bread based diet (and usually whole grains to boot since they used to be cheaper). An example of this is the Ancient/early medieval Roman bread dole. A poor Roman would receive an allowance of bread and olive oil (http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_supply_to_the_city_of_Rome). <br><br>Then, from the shadows, along comes the industrial revolution. Previously meat, one of the more calorie rich foods, was very expensive. With industrial production it becomes available to anyone (think McDonalds Dollar Menu). Even more insidiously, sugars (like corn syrup) have become so cheap as to be almost free. This means that a person can make an incredibly caloric, cheap, and addictive food. <br><br>That<sq>s just one side of it though, while unhealthful foods became cheaper, healthful foods became relatively more expensive. The industrial revolution made all food cheaper, but unhealthful foods much much more so. In the ancient world most of an average person<sq>s income went to food (see Diocletian<sq>s Edict on Prices). This means that hamburgers are cheap and wholesome vegetables are more expensive. This is partly to do with demand (most people think hamburgers taste better than broccoli) but also due to the cheapness of sugar (see the book, Sweetness and Power). <br><br>Another element is education. The poor are statistically less likely to be educated than the affluent. A person who is uneducated is less likely to know which foods are healthful and which are unhealthful. In a position where the relative healthfulness of foods is not explained, rational actors will seek the cheapest and best tasting foods. Wholesome foods are also less available in poor areas. Supermarkets are businesses with razor thin profit margins. They need to use a huge amount of space and the margins on food are very low. This makes it not economically advantageous to build these businesses in poor inner cities. This creates what are called <dq>food deserts<dq>; these are places with high populations but low access to supermarkets. If you are too poor to own a car you can<sq>t simply drive to the rich area to buy food. Often, McDonals/ 7-11 is the only food choice that the poor have (http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert).<br><br>These factors (and a bunch of others that I could go more into) make the poor more likely to be obese.</p>",

For example from what I<sq>ve read in France the minorities often aren<sq>t treated well or they<sq>re around a lot of suffering. Tensions with Europe and Muslims are no better than the US with their minorities. Apparently there is a <dq>lost generation<dq> type feeling among minorities so some go to join ISIS. <br><br>Those that go feel although x country in the west is their <dq>home<dq> country, they aren<sq>t represented or respected there due to gentrification, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, etc so they have nothing to lose back home regardless. Also I read how some are tired of watching their (immigrant) families work hard and play by the book but still they are not respected in society. Their culture and beliefs are mocked or suppressed. This fuels some of them to look for another way. They go back to what they feel are their roots or a greater cause, or at least people that they think are fighting for those values. <br><br>>According to University of Maryland psychologist and terrorism expert Arie Kruglanski, who has studied scores of militant extremists, part of the clue may lie in that Twitter tagline of McCain<sq>s. Not just its content, but the mindset that it indicates\u2014one that sees the world in sharp definition, no shades of gray. <dq>These extreme ideologies have a twofold type of appeal,<dq> explains Kruglanski on the latest Inquiring Minds podcast. <dq>First of all, they are very coherent, black and white, right or wrong. Secondly, they afford the possibility of becoming very unique, and part of a larger whole.<dq><br><br>>That kind of belief system, explains Kruglanski, is highly attractive to young people who lack a clear sense of self-identity, and are craving a sense of larger significance. In fact, Kruglanski and his colleagues have found that one important psychological trait in particular seems to define these militants who leave their own culture and go off to embrace some ideology about which they may not even know very much. (We recently learned that Yusuf Sarwar and Mohammed Ahmed, two British jihadis who went to fight in Syria last year, ordered Islam for Dummies and The Koran for Dummies from Amazon before they departed.)<br><br>>These young people seem to have what psychologists call a very strong <dq>need for cognitive closure,<dq> a disposition that leads to an overwhelming desire for certainty, order, and structure in one<sq>s life to relieve the sensation of gnawing\u2014often existential\u2014doubt and uncertainty. According to Kruglanski, this need is something everyone can experience from time to time. We all sometimes get stressed out by uncertainty, and want answers. We all feel that way in moments, in particular situations, but what Kruglanski shows is that some of us feel that way more strongly, or maybe even all the time. And if you go through the world needing closure, it predisposes you to seek out the ideologies and belief systems that most provide it.<br><br>* [Why do Our Youth Want to Join ISIS?<br>](http<colon>//www.newindianexpress.com/columns/v_sudarshan/Why-do-Our-Youth-Want-to-Join-ISIS/2015/02/08/article2657589.ece)<br><br><br>* [Why Do People Join ISIS?

                "answer": "<p>The motives can vary greatly. Besides the obvious political and religious motives which I think we can safely say represents a majority of them, i<sq>d like to bring attention to one perspective which isn<sq>t often brought up. <br><br>ISIS is, in many ways, the most evolved form of organized crime today. It is funded through criminal activities and flourishes using acts of violence.^1 ^2 It is also made up of many individuals who are career criminals first and foremost, soldiers of god second.* We always hear about the religious motives, but for many, (and this is especially true for westerners joining ISIS) religion is a convenient validation of their criminal activities.  <br><br>Several westerners joining ISIS were convicted criminals who in many cases never set foot in a mosque or knew much of the Coran. They may relate to cultural elements as well as some of the ideas of groups such as ISIS if they happen to be of middle eastern origin for instance. ^3<br><br>Forget about ISIS, religion or politics  for a moment and just think about what motivates many people to commit crimes<colon> Poverty or a feeling of being left out by society, anger towards a system which you cannot seem to find your place in, a feeling of discrimination from authority and society which might emanate from racism or islamophobia. Add to that a personality which might be more prone to violence or mental instability/illness and you have a recipe for a radicalized westerner. I imagine that for some of them, ISIS is a group fighting what they think oppresses them and thus feel a sense of belonging. Of course, this isn<sq>t always true, there are many strange cases of people joining ISIS with an average upbringing.^4 ^5 ^6 ^8<br><br>Conversely, ISIS members from Iraq and Syria are often Sunni muslims who felt left out of the power transition with Maliki in Iraq. Much of the support for ISIS is still an expression of the division between Sunnis and Shias thanks to the US invasion in Iraq which exacerbated the issue. If you take a look at the region controlled by ISIS, it is a region populated with Sunnis muslims almost exclusively. This is why they<sq>ve been able to hold this territory and fail everywhere else. They have the support of a Sunni population which felt left out of the decision process and power transition in Iraq. ^7<br><br>So yes, I suppose the reasons you suggested are fairly accurate but the criminal nature of many of those western individuals cannot be ignored. Unfortunately I can<sq>t seem to find good examples at the moment but there were a number of articles about westerners joining ISIS which stressed the fact that many of them had little knowledge of Islam and a very lengthy criminal record.

It defied orders from al-Qaeda\u2019s top commanders to curtail its transnational ambitions and extremism, which led to ISIS\u2019s expulsion from al-Qaeda in February 2014.

While many people today interpret the plain language of the Constitution differently, their interpretation has not gone through the necessary procedures to become the law. Essentially the Constitution *still is* what the founders meant for it to be, because for the most part it has not been formally amended by later Congresses, and so the interpretation of the first Congresses is still the law of the land.<br><br>Hope this helps.

The real benefit of a petition drive is likely to be increased visibility for the organization or movement behind it as well as opportunities to recruit new members or create mailing lists or other tools for future organizing. The ease of starting a petition drive makes it an interesting choice for an initial action in a campaign to address an issue. If the goals are kept realistic (2,500 signatures by registered voters which will be used to arrange a meeting with your city representative, for example) then a petition drive can be an effective tactic.<br><br>Sources<colon><br>Dry Bones Rattling<colon> Community Building to Revitalize American Democracy (2001) by Mark Warren <br><br>The Community Economic Development Handbook (2002) by Mihailo Temali</p>",

You might also want to try /r/askhistorians<br><br>First, when we say <dq>men typically have shorter hair than women<dq> we need to remember that this is an observation mostly from the context of our modern, western outlook. It<sq>s a social norm within our culture that men have shorter hair, but it wasn<sq>t always that way. [Pink used to be considered a masculine color](http<colon>//www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/When-Did-Girls-Start-Wearing-Pink.html) and [men used to wear high heels](http<colon>//thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/02/05/from-manly-to-sexy-the-history-of-the-high-heel/). These things are no longer *in vouge*, so to speak. Also it<sq>s really contextual on the *here* (developed, western world) and *now* (today) to have this view. Long hair is a sign of religious devotion among Sikhs, it was common for Native American men to wear their hair long, and during the 16th & 17th centuries wigs were very long and wavy. There<sq>s a really interesting article on the significance of the <dq>Queue<dq> hairstyle in China<sq>s history [here](http<colon>//www.eastasianhistory.org/sites/default/files/article-content/08/EAH08_03.pdf). But coming back to the question, the average Reddit user now probably sees long hair on men as effeminate. <br><br>Before we get to the <dq>why<dq> we need to recognize [the cultural weight and significance of a man (or even a kid) having longer hair](http<colon>//www.bilerico.com/2010/01/hair_gender_and_power.php). Hair length is a kind of [gender performance, ala Judith Butler](http<colon>//www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/genderandsex/modules/butlergendersex.html), that communicates our identity in society, and symbolizes values that are not immediately apparent. Obesity was/is [a sign of wealth and good health](http<colon>//dianabuja.wordpress.com/2010/10/16/obesity-a-sign-of-wealth-in-19th-century-africa-now/) in some some cultures. Here (particularly on Reddit) it<sq>s a sign that people are physically unwell, or even lazy. The symbolism of what one values through their hairstyle can be polemic - in the English Civil War, Cromwell<sq>s puritans wore short hair as a sign of their religious convictions for modesty, while the royalists Cavaliers had longer hair and were considered more worldly. So there are strong politics to how people perceive other<sq>s appearances (think <dq>ghetto booty<dq> <dq>gym rat<dq> <dq>waifish<dq>). African American hair is probably one of [the most politicized features](http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/fashion/27SKIN.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) in US society.<br><br>Onto the why - there are several possible historical reasons for the origin of this norm. One is the military and how basically a generation of men served in WWI and WWII, where long hair was not accepted (or appropriate) for fighting. Another is the Judeo-Christian values around the appearance of men vs women and how men should cut their hair or else [they are dirty awful sinners](http<colon>//www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1-Corinthians-11-14/) (conversely, some Christians believe that [women must NEVER cut their hair](http<colon>//wisdom4today.org/wisdom/why-do-some-christian-women-wear-dresses-or-skirts-and-long-hair/) because [it gives them magical powers](http<colon>//hypokriticism.blogspot.com/2012/11/holy-magic-hair-upci-stamp-of-approval.html)). Another reason is that long hair is still associated with the sixties and the anti-establishment attitudes of men then, and so long hair is associated with a sort of *passe* cliche of non-conformity. <br><br>But the real why is WHY are those attitudes so prevalent? The reason for this is because the image of a shaved man with shorter hair is synonymous as a symbol in our culture for success and stability. The same has been true for [facial hair](http<colon>//hypokriticism.blogspot.com/2012/11/holy-magic-hair-upci-stamp-of-approval.html) for a long time. Men with long hair are [unemployed](http<colon>//marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/19/christian-bale-explains-long-hair-im-unemployed/), [messy](http<colon>//www.ronalfy.com/men-with-long-hair/), [dangerous](http<colon>//www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9890931/Rebels-with-a-cause-Bikers-upset-at-scruffy-description.html), [crazy](http<colon>//heymedia.wordpress.com/2008/09/23/is-alan-moore-batshit-crazy/), [weirdos](http<colon>//www.yanni.com/), and so on.

The 21<percent> includes 4<percent> of the total who are in med school and 4<percent> who are in law school.  Most of those engaged in immediate graduate study will end up in one of the other categories, obviously.  About 18<percent> work in education (near the 19<percent> high set the last time the survey was done in 2008, up from 4<percent> in 1970).  11<percent> work in business or finance (high<colon> 22<percent> in 2000, low<colon> 8<percent> in 1975).  16<percent> work in industry, a thirty-five year high (low<colon> 5<percent> in 2002; data only goes back to 1975).  7<percent> are in government or public service, 4<percent> in communications, 4<percent> in health fields (not including medical school), 4<percent> in law related jobs (not including law school), 4<percent> in the fine arts or museums, and one or two percent in several other categories.  If you care, they have a break down of employment by employment area by undergraduate major division (languages & literatures, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences) and by major, as well as several other sets of descriptive statistics.  <br><br>So yes, more Yale graduates are working in business and finance than 20 years ago (seen by many people as <dq>not useful<dq>), but many more also go directly into working in education than 20 years ago (seen by many people as <dq>useful<dq>).  The question is hard and any simple <dq>yes<dq> or <dq>no<dq> answer is not going to give you a fair assessment of the issue because ultimately, it<sq>s a moral judgement, not an objective one.<br><br>*Note 1*<colon> Looking at the data she cites (the second thing I link to), I<sq>m not sure where she gets her 25<percent> number.

Wage gaps in the bottom half of Britain\u2019s pay scale have shrunk sharply since the late 1990s. <br><br>>A new study by a trio of British labour-market economists (including one at the Low Pay Commission) attributes much of that contraction to the minimum wage. Wage inequality fell more for women (a higher proportion of whom are on the minimum wage) than for men and the effect was most pronounced in low-wage parts of Britain.</p>",

Think term-limits, limited or transparent lobbying, campaign financing reform, etc.<br>* **Prison reforms**, in light of the growing mountains of evidence that not only do prisons fail at deterring crime, they actually dehumanize the prisoners to the point that most can<sq>t make it on the outside after serving their time.

(This is changing, though, as I can tell you about my personal experiences with National, AMU, Capella, and Northcentral). <br><br>Long Version<colon> <br><br>I can talk about higher education in America since that<sq>s the topic of my PhD. <br><br>Take a look at the 2012 Harkin Report, a study that was done in the US Senate about for-profit schools.  From the report, it became enormously evident that Americans were feeling like they were not getting a return on investment with regard to for-profit colleges.  These were more expensive, had worse overall persistence and completion rates, and were generally regarded (thanks to aggressive marketing tactics) as diploma mills.  Americans were dropping out at higher rates, raking up student loan debt, and getting angry that their hard-earned degrees were not leading to high-paying jobs like the American dream had promised them. <br><br>Is this because for-profits are all <dq>diploma mills<dq>? <br><br>Universities like Capella, for example, are accredited by the same institution that accredits Ivy League institutions.  The place I<sq>m getting my PhD is a for-profit, online institution, and is accredited by the same entity that accredits all state universities and colleges in the southeast United States.<br><br>Perception of for-profits tends to be abysmal for anyone not privy to how higher education actually works in society.  Some think getting a degree is a guarantee--a guarantee that you will become gainfully employed, be able to support a family, and retire with a good pension.  This is the great lie that we<sq>ve all been told, left over from the Industrial Revolution.  Remember when we told our kids you could get into a factory job out of high school and make enough money to support a family, buy a car, buy a house, and retire?  Those days are gone, and it<sq>s not higher education<sq>s fault.  Unfortunately, higher education is the most tangible thing to blame<colon> I spent years getting a degree and now I can<sq>t find a job--it MUST be education<sq>s fault! (People [really think this](https<colon>//www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/31/study-finds-most-who-enroll-profit-colleges-experience-earning-declines))<br><br>It doesn<sq>t help that there are [studies](https<colon>//www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/15/01/how-do-employers-view-profits) supporting this notion with regards to employment.  Sometimes people think that having attended a for-profit college makes an applicant less worthy, but the reality of the situation is that for-profit students tend to be non-traditional (i.e., not right out of high school, tend to have dependents, tend to have one or more jobs, etc).  More on this in the next section. <br><br>So no, for-profits are not <dq>diploma mills,<dq> since they are accredited by the same entity that is accrediting that school that is being sold as <dq>better<dq> than the online institution you were thinking about attending. <br><br>So are for-profits just preying on people to rack up student loan debt? <br><br>Yes, unfortunately, but not because for-profit education is inherently bad.  These institutions recognized a gap in public education and filled it, using the principles of free market capitalism to make money and serve students.  Think of it like this<colon>  public institutions have a gatekeeping process that weeds out people who otherwise would have not attended college anyway, and for-profit colleges tend to have very open admissions policies.  This means that for-profits are going to enroll people who would have never gone to college in the first place, creating a population of people hyped up on marketing tactics but generally unprepared for the rigors of higher education.  Combine this with a primarily distance-based pedagogy and you have a recipe for failure. <br><br>The 2012 Harkin Report identified some troubling statistics about for-profit higher education, one of which was that for-profit schools spend upwards of 50+<percent> of their expenditures on marketing alone.  In my opinion, this was unsettling to the Senate committee because it was a hard look at how capitalism solves problems.  Again, we have to remember that for-profits didn<sq>t just appear out of nowhere; there was a void created by public institutions that for-profits came in and filled.  <br><br>So why are outcomes at for-profits so abysmal? <br><br>For-profits attract non-traditional adult learners, who have a [unique learning style](https<colon>//www.aacu.org/publications-research/periodicals/research-adult-learners-supporting-needs-student-population-no).  On top of that, students who choose to attend for-profit schools tend to rationalize their choices for many reasons, one of which being that they feel more in control of their [return on investment](http<colon>//education.uci.edu/brownbags/iloh_For-Profit<percent>20College<percent>20and<percent>20Community<percent>20College<percent>20Choice<percent>20through<percent>20Rational<percent>20Choice.pdf).  <br><br>However, the open admissions policy coupled with distance education format is a recipe for outcomes disaster.  Due to correspondence schools of yesteryear being scammy, distance education has been traditionally disregarded as less <dq>genuine<dq> and less respectable than in-person alternatives.  However, as people with degrees from online schools do more and more great things, the perception of value for primarily distance education based schools is beginning to [level out](http<colon>//jolt.merlot.org/vol10no3/Platt_0914.pdf).<br><br>The recipe for disaster--online education coupled with open admissions policies--is why for-profit outcomes are so abysmal.  Distance education is extremely tough; I<sq>ve earned a BA, MA, and now I<sq>m working on a PhD entirely online, while taking care of three kids, working a full-time job, and actively writing and publishing.  People are, in my opinion, scared about people like me because I<sq>m a non-traditional PhD<colon> I<sq>m not teaching as a stipulation of my matriculation (and subsequently, undergraduates and graduate students are not being taught by a master<sq>s level practitioner, a [huge problem](https<colon>//www.quora.com/Why-is-it-that-some-colleges-have-graduate-students-teach-classes-instead-of-professors) in traditional universities); I<sq>ve got a really successful book out there and in the works on another one; I<sq>m a strong leader at the institution I work at... I<sq>ve met plenty of people with motivation and ambition who can succeed in a distance education model, earn a degree, and go on and do what they want.  I<sq>ve also met people who are not intrinsically motivated, think a degree is going to solve whatever problems they<sq>re having in life, and then get disappointed when they are in debt and now can<sq>t find a job.  <br><br>Speaking of graduate students teaching at universities<colon> this is a cost-saving feature.  Why have your PhD teach a class when one of that PhD<sq>s students can teach it instead?  Public institutions are cutting costs this way and through the [adjunctivisation of higher education](http<colon>//www.forbes.com/sites/noodleeducation/2015/05/28/more-than-half-of-college-faculty-are-adjuncts-should-you-care/#75d43a6d1d9b) all the time, but we punish for-profits for navigating the capitalist rules of a free market and not public universities.

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m Swiss - I think the one key point are missing is that Switzerland is a very federalist country. Historically, Switzerland was more a bit like a mixture between the EU and NATO. The cantons (what the US calls states) were quite independent and what really held the country together was the common defense agreement. The Swiss managed to keep away foreign power that way for centuries. Only in 1848 Switzerland became a country in a classical sense. So I think nationalism was never so much about being one group but many different groups that can find some common agreements. This is still true today. A lot of people dislike the central government and each state still has its own laws, school systems, police.. Lots of people from one part of the country actually don<sq>t like people from another part but most people don<sq>t care too much because everyone can kind of create their own rules. Also most referendums and elections in Switzerland don<sq>t take place on national level but on state/canton and municipal level. <br><br>There are other aspects<colon><br><br>* Often referendums are actually rather vague and it<sq>s the job of the federal parliament to create the actual laws, so there is room for adjustments there. E.g. the universal basic income referendum simply stated that a basic income has to be introduced but it neither defined how high it has to be (most media outlets reported that incorrectly) nor how exactly such an income is supposed to be funded. If we had accepted the referendum by 50.1<percent> then the parliament would have most likely introduced only a light version. Also it often takes years to go through that process (see next point).<br>* Federal laws often leave the details and execution to the cantons and even to the municipals. So if you live in a municipal in canton that was really against some referendum that still got accepted then it<sq>s most likely going to affect you less because it will be adjusted and watered down by your local politicians.<br>* A lot of referendums are actually rather irrelevant or simply political campaigning. You can<sq>t compare them all to very important referendums such as Scotland leaving the UK. A lot of left and right wing parties use referendums to promote their ideas even though they know that it will never pass because the ideas aren<sq>t mainstream enough. Also some referendums are actually very boring and we simply need to vote on it due to constitutional reasons or because some fringe group managed it to trigger a referendum even though they can never convince the public.<br>* People are used the referendums. It<sq>s a pretty old tradition. I was actually in the UK during the Scotland referendum and I thought it was bit like a child that does something for the first time (no offense). The Swiss are very used to referendums so it<sq>s simply not such a big deal anymore. E.g. last weekend wasn<sq>t a particularly big event. Nobody cared about the basic income because everyone knew that it won<sq>t pass. It was really just the foreign media that made a big deal out of it. Swiss media mainly focused on the new immigration law but early polls showed that it will likely pass so the big far right wing party decided not to campaign against it, so it was actually a pretty boring referendum weekend by Swiss standards.<br><br>Not sure about sources, this is mainly what you learn in school about the political system, history and by following politics in Switzerland, so kind of common sense if you are Swiss.

Economics has long treated taste as a black box--the most famous economics paper on taste is Stigler<sq>s and Becker<sq>s 1977 <dq>De Gustibus Non Est Disputandum<dq> which basically argues that social scientists should treat taste a black box (I<sq>m mentioning this mainly to ask if economics still treat taste like this).  Sociology has taken a different approach.  Here, the touchstone is Pierre Bourdieu<sq>s *Distinction*.  Bourdieu is often treated as a one of those <dq>big French theorists<dq> who uses too many big words, but this is actually a highly statistical work (relying mainly on multiple-correspondence analysis).  It<sq>s a dense book, and his writing style is particularly poor and opaque (he famously talks a lot about things like <dq>structuring structures<dq>), but his main argument is that taste is associated with socio-economic class.  We don<sq>t take all of *Distinction* as a gospel now (there are many debates, for example, whether low socio-economic taste is <dq>dominated<dq> and largely responsive to high socio-economic taste as Bourdieu argues, or whether its development is as agentive as high socio-economic taste), but this insight is the basis.<br><br>In music, this taste hierarchy is largely codified by genre.  Classical music is traditionally high socio-economic taste, country music is low socio-economic taste.  There<sq>s a famous paper by Bethany Bryson called <dq><sq>Anything But Heavy Metal<sq><colon> Symbolic Exclusion and Musical Dislikes<dq> (1996) which argues not only what we like, but what we dislike is structured by socio-economic class.  Even from the title you can see that tastes heavily fit into genres (in b4 all the metal heads<colon> this paper is old, so what <dq>heavy metal<dq> meant in 1992 when this data was taken is different from today).  But it<sq>s hard to imagine an analogous title based on movie genres<colon> <dq>Anything but Comedies<dq>,  <dq>Anything but Dramas<dq>; <dq>Anything but Action Movies<dq> might work but you see that taste is movies is structured differently, but that doesn<sq>t mean that Bourdieusian socio-economic distinction is absent.  In an unpublished side project, I<sq>m looking at Bourdieu and sex (and how we *don<sq>t* see the same class distinctions in sexual taste, and I<sq>m arguing why), so I know less about movies than I do music (which is the classic taste category that a lot of sociology of culture starts with), but if you want an example of racial divide in movies, look at the career of Tyler Perry, who has been hugely successful with black audiences but has largely failed to <dq>crossover<dq> to white audiences.  At the same time, there are individual artists who have largely crossed off between black and white audience in music--Michael Jackson is an obvious example.  Taste in movies, I should hasten to add, does still involve socio-economic class (the audience for, say, Oscar-bait like *Crash* is very different from a cheap horror movie like *Paranormal Activity*), but it<sq>s often characteristics of the individual movie not the genre as a whole that signals to audience about this taste.<br><br>This of course only says that music and movies are structured differently (musical taste the distinction is largely in the genre category; in movies, distinction works differently), but doesn<sq>t explain why they<sq>re classed differently.  There are many arguments that could be made here--movies are more capital intensive so they inherently require larger audiences; movies have larger <dq>[art worlds](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_world)<dq> (in the [Howie Becker](http<colon>//www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520256361) sense) which in turn affects the scope of the audience; it is easier to pioneer a new musical genre than a new film genre (see Jen Lena<sq>s work on starting music genres) so they <dq>distinction<dq> between high brow taste and low brow taste can be easily renewed at the genre level; etc.--but I don<sq>t know enough about cultural sociology to explain exactly why they are structure differently (a quick note--I<sq>m a mod, so all speculation as to why that is not based on existing social scientific research while be deleted immediately).</p>",

Every heterosexual relationship is a compromise between the wants of a man and the wants of a woman, so differences between the sexes tend to be minimized. But homosexuals do not have to compromise, and their sex lives showcase human sexuality in purer form (at least insofar as the rest of their sexual brains are not patterned like those of the opposite sex). In a study of homosexuals in San Francisco before the AIDS epidemic, twenty-eight percent of gay men reported having had more than a thousand sex partners, and seventy-five percent reported having more than a hundred. No gay woman reported a thousand partners, and only two percent reported as many as a hundred. Other desires of gay men, like pornography, prostitutes, and attractive young partners, also mirror or exaggerate the desires of heterosexual men. (Incidentally, the fact that men<sq>s sexual wants are the same whether they are directed at women or directed at other men refutes the theory that they are instruments for oppressing women.) It<sq>s not that gay men are oversexed; they are simply men whose male desires bounce off other male desires rather than off females desires. Symons writes, <dq>I am suggesting that heterosexual men would be as likely as homosexual men to have sex most often with strangers, to participate in anonymous orgies in public baths, and to stop off in public restrooms for five minutes of fellatio on the way home from work if women were interested in these activities. But women are not interested.<dq><br></p>",

To examine the acute effects of inhibiting negative and positive emotion, we asked 180 female participants to watch sad, neutral, and amusing films under 1 of 2 conditions. Suppression participants (N\u2002=\u200290) inhibited their expressive behavior while watching the films; no suppression participants (N\u2002=\u200290) simply watched the films. Suppression diminished expressive behavior in all 3 films and decreased amusement self-reports in sad and amusing films. Physiologically, suppression had no effect in the neutral film, but clear effects in both negative and positive emotional films, including increased sympathetic activation of the cardiovascular system. On the basis of these findings, we suggest several ways emotional inhibition may influence psychological functioning.<br><br>According to a model of [emotion self-regulation](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_self-regulation), we have learned to control our response to our emotions through feedback with our observations of the environment, e.g., expression of emotions that is socially tolerable.

However, the result will be based on how the specific child<sq>s developing personality interacts and self-regulates emotion in response to the child<sq>s perception of the environment.

Many of the Nazi rally images you can find online in the daytime, if you just ignore the Nazi symbols, look pretty epic.<br><br>Stealing this example from an Overthinkingit article I found while randomly google searching, but basically the same aesthetic/composition with two different contexts<colon> [Nazi rally from Triumph of the Will](https<colon>//www.overthinkingit.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Triumph-of-the-will.jpg) vs [celebratory scene from end of Star Wars](https<colon>//www.overthinkingit.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Rebels.gif).<br><br>And as mentioned, nothing is explicitly evil about their symbology. The swastika is modification of a symbol of good luck in hinduism and buddhism that goes way back before Nazism.

And I think it<sq>s normal to view overt glorification of the military and authority as bad nowadays. But a lot of that I think comes from associations post-world-wars and cold-war.

Gun restrictions between states seem to have little or no effect on reducing gun-related crime, and that if such a relationship exists, it follows the <dq>less guns, less crime<dq> hypothesis. However, this weak correlation could be a result of the fact that gun restrictions in the United States are severely limited by the rights granted by the Second Amendment that give Americans the right to bear arms. Only restrictions such as licensing and right to carry laws can be enacted in states, and guns can legally be owned by most people. Gun-related deaths in particular are more closely linked to socioeconomic factors such as poverty and unemployment than gun ownership.<br><br>When we look internationally, the idea that socioeconomic factors play a bigger role than gun regulation in firearms violence is enforced. Gun ownership and gun regulations don<sq>t tend to reduce gun related deaths in middle income countries, which tend to experience an inflow of illegal firearms and have high crime rates. Honduras for example only has 6.2 guns per 100 inhabitants, but experiences the highest rate of gun-related homicides per year at 64.8 per 100,000 people. This is compared to gun ownership in the US at 88.8 per 100 inhabitants, but a gun homicide rate of just 10.64. Honduras has relatively more restrictions on firearms and the types of firearms that can be owned by civilians, yet experiences a much higher rate of gun homicides even with fewer legally registered guns. The disparity can probably be explained by Honduras being a middle income country with more crime and less enforcement of laws than the US.

In the long run, economic growth comes through increased labor productivity and technological change, not through the accumulation of factors of production. See Easterly and Levine, <dq>It<sq>s Not Factor Accumulation,<dq> 2000.<br><br>2. The basic Solow growth model can, nevertheless, form the useful core of a theory of growth. See Mankiw, Romer, and Weil, <dq>A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth,<dq> 1992.<br><br>3. In the long run, the price level is directly proportional to the level of the money stock. The inflation rate is proportional to the growth rate of the money stock. See Lucas, <dq>Monetary Neutrality,<dq> 1995. (This is the *quantity theory of money.*)<br><br>4. In the long run, the level of output is independent of the money stock. The growth rate of output is independent of the growth rate of the money stock. See Lucas, <dq>Monetary Neutrality,<dq> 1995. (This is the *neutrality of money.*)<br><br>5. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon (see 3), so monetary policy may be usefully tasked with the responsibility of keeping inflation stable.<br><br>5. In the short run, monetary policy can affect *both* output growth *and* inflation. This is the Phillips Curve relationship. See Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, <dq>Monetary Policy Shocks,<dq> 1999.<br><br>6. Monetary policy takes some time to affect broader macroeconomic aggregates. Hence the central bank should not target *current* inflation, but inflation *over some medium-term horizon,* typically 2-5 years. See Svensson, <dq>Inflation Forecast Targeting,<dq> 1997.<br><br>7. Stabilization policy can usefully mitigate business-cycle fluctuations. See Friedman, <dq>The Role of Monetary Policy, 1968. See Eichenbaum, <dq>Some Thoughts on Practical Stabilization Policy,<dq> 1998. See Svensson, <dq>What have we learned in the past 50 years,<dq> 2008.<br><br>8. Monetary and fiscal policymaking should be analyzed as <dq>rules,<dq> not as year-by-year decisions about the interest rate or deficit. Policy should be systematic, predictable, and lean against macroeconomic fluctuations. See Kydland and Prescott, <dq>Rules rather than Discretion,<dq> 1977. <br><br>8. Macroeconomic policy is affected by the way the private sector *perceives* policy. Statistical correlations can break down as soon as policymakers try to exploit them. See Lucas, <dq>Expectations and the Neutrality of Money,<dq> 1972. See Lucas, <dq>Econometric Policy Evaluation<colon> A Critique,<dq> 1976.<br><br>9. If monetary policy is stabilizing the business cycle, there is little role for countercyclical fiscal policy. See Auerbach, <dq>Is there a role for discretionary fiscal policy,<dq> \u200e2002. See Taylor, <dq>Reassessing Discretionary Fiscal Policy,<dq> 2000. Fiscal policy should focus on public finance issues<colon> public goods provision, social insurance provision, reasonable taxation, and reasonable regulation practices. Leave countercyclical policy to the central bank.<br><br>9. Monetary expansion is expansionary; fiscal contraction is contractionary. See [here.](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/32z2hr/bad_economic_discussion_thread_17_april_2015/cqgljzk)<br><br>10. In the long run, exchange rates reflect puchasing power parity. In the short run, we have no idea what drives exchange rate fluctuations. See Rogoff, <dq>The PPP Puzzle,<dq> JEL 1996.<br><br>Maybe some of those are uninteresting to you, but they are a start.

There are two schools of thought on how to deal with this problem<colon>  <br><br>1. Satiate demand. Some people (Stiles) advocate that you need a legal market such that people who want Ivory will be able to buy it and snuff out the illegal black market of poaching.  In this view, stockpiles should be sold off to satiate demand. <br><br>2. Extinguish demand. Others argue that we have to change cultural preferences to kill demand. In this view, allowing the legal ivory market to exist does nothing to hinder demand and will lead to elephant killing (Rice). In this view stockpiles should be destroyed and preferences changed.  <br><br>The critique of point (1) is that the countries with poaching problems are corrupt and will allow illegal ivory to enter the legal trade (Bennett). This is because the officials on the ground are underpaid and willing to accept a cut of the ivory profits in exchange for labeling illegal ivory as legal or allowing poaching.  <br><br>If you agree with view (2) and think creating a legal market is impossible in light of corruption, then you should want to change preferences for ivory ASAP. Destroying the stockpiles makes sense, you dont want to reward people for buying them. <br><br>As far as effectiveness goes, Rice observes that demand for ivory INCREASED after CITES allowed a 1 time stockpile sale in the 1990s and 2000s, arguing that selling ivory increased demand for it. Stiles instead argues that demand grew independently because of the Chinese economic boom. I think a middle route is that the Chinese boom is a driver, but the one-time sale definitely did not help stop poaching. <br><br>(1) Rice, M.

A good example of this womanly feature is looking at great works of art throughout time, as women are almost always smooth and unfettered by all that horrible body hair. We also have instances of women battling the body hair through out time and throughout the world, from plucking, shaving, slathering on arsenic, and burning hair off (look up ancient Egyptian hair removal, or ancient Greek/Roman hair removal.) So excess body hair on women has a history of being seen as undesirable.<br><br>The rise of modern shaving and need for hair removal has often been attributed to many factors, starting in the early 1900s.<br><br>1. The invention of the safety razor. Ever shaved your legs with a straight razor? There is a reason why it wasn<sq>t commonly done.<br><br>2. Gillette<sq>s ad campaign.

([Example](http<colon>//ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81TQ40pdPAL._SL1494_.jpg).)<br><br>4. Leg shaving caught on later when shorter skirts became more common and women began revealing more of the leg. Some people blame the pin-up girls like the famous [Betty Grable](http<colon>//vintagemoviefan.freehomepage.com/images/1943.jpg) in the 1940s to the rise of fashionable pantyhose which is uncomfortable against hairy legs.<br><br>Why do women still shave? I blame aggressive advertising and time. There is a lot of money being made by women shaving. It isn<sq>t surprising that the largest razor producers are in the U.S., and that U.S. women feel the most pressure to remain clean shaven. Models, celebrities, women in television shows, women in movies, all of them are clean shaven. Sexiness, beauty, etc. = no hairy legs or armpits. Remember when the actress Mo<sq>Nique showed off her hairy legs at some awards show? She was bashed coast to coast as being gross.<br><br>Also, almost a hundred years later, shaving has become a part of our culture.

In fact, the *Manifesto* is actually a really poor source in defining the ideals of Communism and what it tries to accomplish. It was basically written as a propaganda piece to get the uneducated working class on board with the movement led by intellectual elites without having to give them a long education in politics, economics, history and the theories about these subjects that are central to Communism. For a more accurate view of Communism, Marx<sq>s *Das Kapital* and Engel<sq>s *The Condition of the Working Class in England* are the best for the ideology at its inception (Adam Smith<sq>s *The Wealth of Nations* should also be required reading because a lot of early Communist literature is a direct commentary on this work).<br><br>Where Totalitarianism comes from is actually quite simple. Several revolutions were attempted and failed and Marx took them to be experimental evidence that some of his ideas didn<sq>t work and that the theory needed some changing. The most important of these was the 1871 Paris Commune, where Socialists walled off Paris and proceeded to create a by-the-book Communist society. Within a few weeks, the French army decided they wanted their capital back and destroyed this society. In response, Marx wrote *The Civil War in France*, which was basically a commentary on what went wrong with this <dq>ideal<dq> society. Most of his recommendations involved the establishment of more authoritarian measures to secure the revolution against outside forces and more quickly bring down the structures of the previous regime. This was the precursor to Leninism, Stalinism, and Maoism, in which these ideas were put into action and actually maintained a stable power structure, unlike previous Communist revolts. To Communists at the time, stability was proof enough that this was the right road to achieve the utopian dream they sought.<br><br>It should be noted that in the 50s, many Communists in the West began to see how horrible life under Stalin had been and underwent a fundamentalist shift that emphasized the early, idealistic vision of Communism and treated the later writings that led to Totalitarian states like they never existed. They also started a euphemism campaign to relabel a lot of ideas to dissociate themselves from the Soviet Union.

                "answer": "<p>First<colon> Excuse my English. Now<colon> I think this is mostly due to two developments.<br><br>(a) The notion of human dignity which developed (in its current form) around the turn of the centuries (18th to 19th) with the *Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen* during the French Revolution and (later) philosophers like Kant. A good read here is Kant<sq>s *Groundworks on the Metaphysics of Morals*, the works of Siey\u00e8s and of course the Declaration of 1789 itself. That was probably more of an indirect influence though, which altered our general perspective on and our treatment of human beings.<br><br>(b) The general tranformation in the way we punish people. Foucault observed that (around the same time) people began to treat delinquents very differently. In classical times, punishment was a way in which the sovereign (usually the king) demonstrated his power. Crime was basically an <dq>insult<dq> to the king<sq>s sovereignity and thus had to be punished *symbolically* and *publically* (e.g. dismemberment). However, modern times brought the development of the *disciplines*, ways in which society gains control over the body of the individual and puts it to use. The emergence of the disciplines produced the prison as a form of disciplining criminals, utilizing and conditioning them (just think about prison work as a first, albeit banal example). This is obviously a very short summary that doesn<sq>t really do the topic justice. I suggest you read Foucault<sq>s *Discipline and Punish*.<br><br>However, I think (and others have already mentioned it) that we may actually be returning to some sort of public shaming through the rise and vulgarization of mass media. Why this is, I don<sq>t know, but maybe it is an even better (additional) way to conditioning us as people?</p>",

                "answer": "<p>This answers not why it became the drink of celebration, but more how it became a worldwide phenomenon.<br><br>Napoleon was defeated in 1814 by a coalition of allies including Russia, Great Britain, Prussia and Austria and was exiled to the island of Elba. Many of the final battles of the 1814 campaign happened in the northeast of France near Reims in the heart of the Champagne district. The advancing coalition troops, led by the Russians, captured Reims, the French briefly recaptured it, and then it fell again to the Russians in the days before Napoleon<sq>s surrender. Both Russian and French troops celebrated their respective victories with a little-known local drink called Champagne. Thus began the ascent of Champagne to the world famous drink of celebration we know today<colon><br><br><br><br>from *The Widow Clicquot* by Tilar J. Mazzeo<colon><br><br><dq>Champagne was not always big business. ... In the second part of the eighteenth century, champagne was in a slump, destined to become a regional curiosity. Local winemakers were struggling to drum up even modest sales, and champagne might have faded into obscurity...<br><br><dq>[However] the arrival of the Russians [in Reims in 1814] would ... prove a brilliant marketing opportunity for the winemakers throughout the Champagne ... These new men would never forget [the] sparkling wines [of Reims]. Watching the destruction of his cellars, Jen-R\u00e9my [Mo\u00ebt] also saw the potential. <sq>All these officers who ruin me today,<sq> he predicted. <sq>will make my fortune tomorrow. All those who drink my wine are salesmen who, on returning to their own country, will make the product famous.<sq><br><br><dq>These Russians, however, were not the only ones in the winter of 1814 to enjoy the champagne of [Reims] ... In early March, the French army under the leadership of General Corbineau recaptured Reims. ... <br><br><dq>Of course, the French troops wasted no time in celebrating their victory, either. There is a legend, in fact, that it was during these days that the art of sabrage -- opening champagne bottles with military sabers -- was invented. According to the story, <sq>Madame Clicquot ... in order to have her land protected, gave Napoleon<sq>s officers Champagne and glasses. Being on their horses, they couldn<sq>t hold the glass while opening the bottle.<sq> So they lopped off the necks of the bottles with their swords, and sabrage was born. ...<br><br><dq>Napoleon abdicated the throne of France in early April, and the Russians were briefly in Reims again, celebrating the end of the war in boisterous spirits. ... Russian officers toasting the end of the long campaign toasted with ... champagne. Everywhere in the city, <sq>Russian officers ... lifted the champagne glass to their lips. It was said even that many of them preferred the popping of the bottle of Rheims to the cannon of the Emperor.<sq> After long years of war, the British were no less exuberant. Lord Byron wrote to his friend Thomas Moore in the second week of April, <sq>We clareted and champagned till two.<sq> Already, champagne was on its way to becoming another word for mass-culture celebration. ...<br><br><dq>That the Napoleonic Wars should have ended in the Champagne region is mere happenstance, but it was a pivotal moment in the history of this wine, a moment that forged its cultural identity. Champagne wine was already enjoyed as the drink of festivity. It had been since the earliest days of its history. But a hundred little obstacles had impeded its broad commercial appeal. For centuries, it had been the wine only of the wealthiest and most discerning of connoisseurs, and the total production in France at its prewar height had never been more than four hundred thousand bottles. Within decades of Napoleon<sq>s defeat, it would multiply more than tenfold, to over five million.<dq><br><br><br><br>TLDR<colon> Some of the final battles of the Napoleonic war ended near Champagne. As each side celebrated their respective victories in the town, <sq>Champagne<sq> was the drink of celebration for everyone from the soldiers to the officers. Basically it spread through letters and word-of-mouth back to their homes. Legend also has it that this is where the custom of opening champagne bottles with swords originated. As a result, production of champagne grew from 400,000 bottles prewar to over 5,000,000 within a few decades of Napoleon<sq>s defeat.</p>",

The YouGov poll results reveal that Americans who say they frequently watch spy-themed television shows or movies are significantly more likely than infrequent watchers to approve of assassinating terrorists, torturing terrorists, and using every torture technique pollsters asked about except threatening terrorist detainees with dogs. (Spytainment fans, however, are not more likely to support dropping nuclear bombs on terrorists or assassinating foreign leaders than anyone else.)<br><br>> ... Of course, these results do not prove that spy-themed entertainment is causing anything. It could be that James Bond and Jason Bourne fans are just naturally more hawkish than the average Joe and are drawn to spytainment because of beliefs they already have. But I have my doubts. Entertainment can and has shifted popular culture and attitudes on other subjects. When L.A. Law was a hit television show in the late 1980s, law school applications hit record levels. The Navy still talks about the movie Top Gun as one of its best recruiting tools.

Obviously, there are costs associated with office space, office supplies, servers, network access, and administrative overhead (everything from payroll, HR, management, to policy makers who set rules on financial aid and decide on national standards).  It is a gross oversimplifications, but the question was incredibly broad and I am not familiar with a data source on how much the US spends on financial aid administration.  Since you failed to provide one in the question, I made up a number.<br><br>* Even if human costs were the only factor, my salary number is largely arbitrary.

[Up until 1996](http<colon>//www.svenskakyrkan.se/gottsunda/defaultaspxid643498), people automatically became members of the Swedish state church when they were born. Then they would have to leave the church themselves (which a lot of people do when they start working, to avoid the church tax/fee). People born 1996 would turn 19 this year. 19 is the age you typically graduate from high school and start working, and therefore also have an incentive to make the decision whether or not to remain a member of the state church. This means that up until now, the share of people who are members of the church because they were born into it and still haven<sq>t started working and thus haven<sq>t yet had an incentive to consider leaving the church has been declining. It will be interesting to see if the drop in membership starts slowing down now. <br><br>We should be careful not to try to correlate this too much with a drop in religiosity. First of all, not all christians are members of the Church of Sweden. About 3.7<percent> of the population are members of various other Christian churches, [according to a wikipedia article with no proper sources](http<colon>//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_i_Sverige#Frikyrkan_i_Sverige). Regardless of what the number is, there are many christians who are not members of the Church of Sweden. ~~[The share of muslims has also been increasing in Sweden since 1995](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Sweden#Demography), which might of course be correlated with the decline in membership.~~ (You can<sq>t draw this conclusion from the numbers presented in the article. It might still be the case though.)<br><br>Edit<colon> [These statistics](http<colon>//www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=1132667&ptid=48063) (reported by the Church of Sweden) might suggest declining religiosity as an explanation as well.

Note that it does not count the number of people, but the number of visits. So if you visit twice in a year, you are counted twice.

Lets talk...<br><br>Correlations and causations are different for one simple reason<colon> correlations are a **statistical** concept and causation is a **methodological** concept. Correlations are a sum of cross product Z scores that account for how much two variables co-vary, or how much they are statistically related. **Causation is simply your ability to rule out plausible alternative hypotheses.**  <br><br>Several other people in this thread have talked about <dq>holding constant<dq> or <dq>controlling for<dq> or <dq>running an experiment<dq> but no one has talked about **why** you<sq>re trying to do that. What are we trying to contain that is so god awful? At the end of the day, we are trying to say that X affects Y and that there are no other plausible reasons for why X affects Y. A true experiment doesn<sq>t, per se, allow you to make a causal claim.<br><br>For example, I run an experiment where my students are randomly assigned to one of two conditions<colon> (1) in one condition I provide positive feedback right before they take the exam (<dq>Many folks do well on this exam<dq>) and (2) in the other condition I provide negative feedback (<dq>Not very many people do well on this exam<dq>). <br><br>This is a true experiment and should provide a causal claim that type of feedback causes grades to change. Or does it? As the designer of the study, I obviously knew my own hypothesis which may affect how I deliver the feedback (perhaps I conveyed negative feedback in a very mean way and positive feedback in a nice way). Or what if there was an earthquake between classes and one class was affected but another was not. Why are these problematic? The reason they are problematic is because they introduce a NEW plausible reason for why X (feedback) affects Y (grades). We can<sq>t tell if class 1 and 2 are different because of the feedback I provided, the way I provided it, or the earthquake. The more plausible explanations that exist, the less <dq>causal<dq> the design. Notice we have not mentioned any statistical concepts in this example. This is because causation has nothing to do with statistics and everything to do with your method. Causality is not a binary factor either. Instead, it is a very long spectrum with <dq>No other plausible explanation<dq> to <dq>all other plausible explanations<dq> at either end of the spectrum. In a true experimental design, we are much closer to the former end, with very few competing reasons for why X affects Y. <br><br>But it only takes **one** plausible reason to eliminate a causal claim! Imagine that a hospital employed a racist nurse who, after administering a drug Y to a black women, made a snide remark that it wouldn<sq>t help cure the patient while administering drug X to white women made the opposite remark. Assume that all other factors were equal. Now we have a competing hypothesis for whether drug X and Y are different. This is only one reason but it<sq>s a good reason that jeopardizes the causal inference of the study. <br><br>Notice also that I mention <dq>plausible<dq> alternative explanations and not <dq>possible<dq>. This is because you<sq>re not trying to eliminate every possible reason that could ever exist, but only the reasons that would otherwise explain why X affected Y. <br><br>One of the most important factors for making a causal claim is that X affected Y and not the other way around. This implies a temporal precedence. X first, then Y. Not Y, then X. Correlations do not make the distinction between time, because time is a methodological feature of measurement (I measured X, THEN I measured Y). Correlations simply indicate that X and Y were measured, with no interest in temporal precedence. Therefore, TIME is the main component that correlations do not imply causations because a correlation - a statistical concept - is completely ignorant of the methods of the study and therefore cannot make any claim about which came first. <br><br>Random assignment and true experiments are simply means to an end<colon> the end goal being to rule out alternative plausible hypothesis by making them IMPLAUSIBLE so that only one plausible explanation remains, the hypothesis the researcher set out to test. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>What a coincidence. My professor, Alison Gash, was just talking to me today about her research into the disparity in backlash between same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption.<br><br>In contrast to your statement, Professor Gash found that during the high tide mark of the anti-gay marriage movement in 2006, polls recorded opposition to both same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption in the U.S. as roughly equivalent. However, the outcomes were very different in that there was very little backlash against same-sex adoption.<br><br>> Why did the backlash against same-sex parenting fail? It certainly wasn\u2019t public opinion. The handful of polls from 2006 that questioned participants about both same sex marriage and adoption rights show that average Americans were no more comfortable with gay parenthood than with gay marriage. In fact, they opposed both by well over fifty percent. And if we take their arguments seriously, it is precisely concern about gay parenthood that drives opposition efforts against marriage equality.<br><br>> Rather, the main problem for conservatives was that they were trying to roll back gay parenting rights that had, in effect, already been granted. This proved a tough sell. The media didn\u2019t much cover the conservative anti-same-sex parenting campaign, and what few stories did run typically featured heartwarming narratives of gay and lesbian couples raising well-adjusted kids. Such families existed in the thousands precisely because the under-the-radar strategy had allowed them to flourish over the previous twenty years. Whereas gay marriage was still an abstraction that opponents could rally the public to prevent, gay families were a reality that the public would have to tear asunder to stop.<br><br>> Also, by the mid-2000s, social scientists had conducted studies on same-sex families. In general, this research demonstrated that children of same sex couples were not appreciably different from kids raised by straight couples\u2014including their propensity to identify as gay or lesbian. These studies were widely quoted in the media and used to foster support among child welfare experts.<br><br>> All this made it a tough fight for anti-gay advocates. As an official at Focus on Family, a conservative Christian advocacy group, concedes, the issue was low on the \u201cradar for pro-family conservatives\u201d because of the \u201cconfusing rhetoric of same-sex adoption, the media bombarding the public with images of happy gay couples taking in disadvantaged kids\u201d and the argument that \u201cthis kind of family is better than no family.\u201d Adds another opponent, \u201ctrying to take the kids away\u2026it\u2019s a ridiculous battle to fight.\u201d<br><br>You can read the rest in [Under the Gaydar](http<colon>//www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/may_june_2013/features/under_the_gaydar043855.php?page=all), an article she wrote for Washington Monthly this spring.

Beyond that, you<sq>d want to know the basics of social construction (which I actually never learned in a formal way), maybe cumulative advantage, maybe Foucault, maybe globalization stuff, maybe one of the two schools that say they want to focus on mechanisms, with rather different groundings (critical theory and analytic sociology).

The essential upshot is this<colon> if you are a Sociological scholar, then you have self-selected into a discipline that studies, and privileges as the central item of its framework, the interaction of individuals in the context of a collective. To illustrate, I<sq>m going to discount white supremacy and other fringe <dq>ideologies<dq> and focus more on the far more widely accepted counterpart to collectivist political ideology - Libertarianism, or Liberalism in European parlance.<br><br>Libertarianism emphasizes the primacy of the [individual](https<colon>//books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iONMIDMmgoMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=sociology+collectivism+economics+individualism&ots=hh86m7HBpD&sig=tTYad6fJexsIpEZYRBqjgVY-tCU), preferring the decentralized decision-making inherent to markets to other, collectivist institutional decision-making processes like through government. Any institution that impedes behavior of the individual is viewed with a generalized skepticism under a Libertarian philosophy. As such, this outlook tends to find a more natural home with classical economics which takes as a given that markets are the most efficient way to allocate limited resources in a world of unlimited desires. Those markets are comprised of *individual* buyers and sellers negotiating with each other via the pricing mechanism to establish the best configuration of utility possible given the limitations of capabilities and resources.<br><br>Sociology utilizes a fundamentally different framework<colon> one which privileges [collective](http<colon>//amj.aom.org/content/38/1/152.short) responses to societal problems and criticizes the power dynamics they claim are inherent to the natural inequalities created by markets. Because sociologists concern themselves with institutions, norms, rules-in-use and other implied or explicit covenants between *collectives* of individuals, they are far less wary of collective (e.g. governmental) responses to what they see as socially unacceptable circumstances, often defined in terms of non-meritocratic asymmetries in power. They will also tend to be far more skeptical of the inherent naturalism argument made by classical economists (who sometimes suggest the markets are the natural way of human behavior absent institutions like governments), insisting that markets are merely one possible institutional arrangement among many other legitimate societal configurations. This is far more akin to the political left which emphasizes the role of non-market collective action to achieve what some see as socially desirable outcomes.<br><br>Left/right ideology has become *the* overriding framework much of the country uses to evaluate almost any disagreement. But, I think that when discussing questions such as the one you raise, it is simply not robust to the true nature of the ongoing disagreement. There are salient differences in epistemology, methods, assumptions and key variables which drive these differences far more than political ideology. Indeed, I don<sq>t believe political ideology is much of a driver of academic work at all - I believe the average academic will experience their first pangs of interest in their ultimate field of choice long before they become substantively aware of politics, if indeed, they ever do. The former drives the latter, I believe, far more than the latter drives the former, as seems to the case with you, OP - it would appear you found an interest in Sociology before you realized its tendency toward left-leaning politics. An obvious potential exception would be political science and public administration, in which both interests are likely to grow hand-in-hand.<br><br>Finally, You<sq>ll also notice I don<sq>t spend very much time covering Trumpism, because one would find very little support in *any* corner of academia for the specific brand of political ideology espoused by the current president. While some members of the right and right media would say that is because academia is part and parcel of a massive left-wing conspiracy to shut out legitimate criticism of their work, academics themselves (of most all ideological, methodological and epistemological stripes, I would reckon) would likely say it is because President Trump has carved out a veritable smorgasbord of positions empirically and rationally unjustifiable by nearly *any* social scientific framework.<br><br>I know there<sq>s a decent amount of my own analysis and experience in here, but I hope the mods (and you, OP) will find this contribution valuable enough to keep.

I don\u2019t think so\u2014for a couple of reasons. First, there is extensive evidence (including in the datasets Fryer considers) of large racial disparities in who gets stopped by police, even controlling for differences in crime rates (perhaps especially under policies like New York City\u2019s \u201cStop-and-Frisk\u201d). Because of this, the \u201chit rate\u201d\u2014or the percent of times a stop ends with a confirmation of wrong-doing\u2014is often higher for whites than blacks. Even if police pulled the trigger without \u201cbias,\u201d this disparity in stops would produce vastly unequal death rates.<br><br>And [this](http<colon>//www.vox.com/2016/7/11/12149468/racism-police-shootings-data) from Vox<colon><br><br>>The study is definitely useful in some regards<colon> Researchers examined the circumstances of police shootings (like whether police were attacked before firing their guns) with much more detail than previous work has, for example. But it\u2019s narrower than a lot of existing research on racial disparities in criminal justice \u2014 so narrow, in fact, that it kind of misses the point of why police killings of young black men are so frequently outrageous.<br><br>>...<br><br>>In other words, Fryer and company found that there weren\u2019t big racial disparities in how often black and white suspects *who\u2019d already been stopped by police* were killed. But they deliberately avoided the question of whether black citizens are more likely to be stopped to begin with ([they are](http<colon>//www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=702)) and whether they\u2019re more likely to be stopped without cause ([yup](https<colon>//thinkprogress.org/white-people-stopped-by-new-york-police-are-more-likely-to-have-guns-or-drugs-than-minorities-9bf579a2b9b3#.36uulcutl)).<br><br>As for further statistical evidence of racial disparities in police killings geared toward a more general audience, [here<sq>s](https<colon>//scatter.wordpress.com/2015/12/15/racial-disparities-in-police-killings-using-bayes-theorem/) a post on <dq>racial disparities in police killings using bayes theorem<dq><colon><br><br>>Rather than figure out the probability that an unarmed suspect was black, it would be important to know the probability that a black suspect killed by police was unarmed. We care less whether an unarmed victim was black as we do whether a black victim was unarmed.<br><br>>...<br><br>>...we find that about 13<percent> of black men killed by police are unarmed. This means that if you hear that the police shot a black person, you can guess that about one out of every eight times the suspect would be unarmed.<br><br>>That provides a discouraging picture of what it means to be black and be policed by in America. But police work is difficult and not every unarmed suspect should be considered safe to officers or the public. It could well be true that the unarmed suspect posed an imminent danger to public safety.<br><br>>If that is the case, however, then we would expect unarmed white suspects to be killed at a similar rate to blacks. Using the same statistical principles that I did above, which mathematicians call Bayes\u2019 Theorem, we can figure out the analogous rate for whites. When we do, I calculate that unarmed white victims make up 29 of the 867, or 3.34<percent>, of all shootings, while 443, or 51.1<percent>, of the police killings involved whites. This results in a probability that a white suspect killed by police was unarmed, or about one in every 16 shootings of white suspects.<br><br>>These calculations mean that *a black suspect killed by the police is twice as likely to be unarmed as a white suspect to be killed by the police.*</p>",

In the West, after the British were defeated in the American Revolution, there was a wave of immigration of slaves travelling with masters who had been displaced by the war. The increased presence of American slaves in Britain led to a greater conversation about slavery and a greater perception that slavery was an unjust institution. The Quakers also had a huge impact on abolitionist movements, especially in the US, citing religious beliefs as a reason against slavery.<br><br>What I think is the greater factor, though, is the slaves themselves. There were many slaves who were imported from Africa who were highly educated, be it in Qur<sq>anic schools in Africa, or through having been abducted as prisoners of war, some even being better educated than their masters. These were people who could read and write and - more importantly - publish works about their experiences and about the inhumanity of slavery. Olaudah Equiano<sq>s work, especially, did a lot to galvanise the early abolition movement by providing it with information from a slave that humanised them and demonstrated what slavery was for the people involved in it. These sentiments reached more and more people, and eventually became what we see as the norm. Essentially, the voices of slaves helped people realise that slavery is not very nice.<br><br>In the Arab world, you have a combination of pressure from Western powers, but also gradual reinterpretation of the Qur<sq>an and its passages about slavery. Much like the West would reinterpret the Bible to leave out slavery, the same began to happen in the Arab world, once again, partly due to slaves<sq> educations, but also due to an increasing number of slave revolts and the increasing power of slaves in society. Quite simply, as slaves became more and more human, it made less and less sense philosophically, intellectually, and theologically to dehumanise them. Verses that advocated for the manumission of slaves became more prominent in Qur<sq>anic interpretation, and slavery became seen as something that, while not expressly forbidden by Allah, was not something that good people did. Good people freed slaves, not create more of them. <br><br>I hope that helps a little, and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Depends how everything is ranked but here are a few reasons, source I grew up and live in the Central Valley.<br><br>* A huge chunk of the economy here is based on agriculture, so when anything happens to that industry everything suffers. Take for example the three year drought we are currently in, this makes the poorest people in our community even more poor, people who work in other areas that support ag also are taking a hit, then the tax base shrinks because people aren<sq>t buying things so the local governments can<sq>t do a whole lot. This article might help you get an idea of just how bad it is here https<colon>//medium.com/matter/why-the-california-drought-is-all-your-fault-55f81a947ce2<br>* Lack of higher education in the valley makes it harder for people to get the skills needed for better jobs, we have a few state schools (CSU Fresno, CSU Bakersfield), handful of community colleges, two private schools (Fresno Pacific and University of the Pacific in Stockton), and we just got a UC campus in 2005 even though it<sq>s small it<sq>s had a large impact on the region already. <br>* Air quality is one of the worst in the nation, the air gets trapped here because of the mountains and since the valley is basically an irrigated desert there isn<sq>t a lot of rain to clear up the air. Ag production contributes a lot to the air problems but also you have to remember that I-5 and highway 99 both run through the valley so if you<sq>re driving though you<sq>re adding to the air problem. <br>* There aren<sq>t a lot of jobs so high unemployment also means lower salaries in general when compared to the richer coastal areas. There is a serious brain drain in the valley with the best and brightest taking off for LA/SF/SD.<br>* Now why did all of this happen? Look at the bay area for example, tech took off there because there was a large population of highly educated workers from the near by colleges (Stanford, UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco). This could never happen in Fresno because there are two four year schools in the area (CSU Fresno and Fresno Pacific) which means there are less workers with the required skills to allow something like that to happen. Same is true of LA and the old aerospace industry or the entertainment industry, the lack of skilled labor again prevents anything like that from taking hold here. <br>* If you look at the work UC Merced is doing you<sq>ll note that they<sq>re not building things like a school of agriculture, they<sq>re copying what the other schools did in the bay area and are focusing on high tech things like better solar panels and nanotechnology in hopes that these markets will come to Merced and that they<sq>ll be able to provide both workers and researchers to these industries. If you look at the work CSU Fresno and CSU Bakersfield are doing they<sq>re focused on the current industries in the area (Oil and Ag), it<sq>s not a bad thing both Oil and Ag need those things but it<sq>s not a radical shift for the region it<sq>s just maintaining the status quo.<br>* Also our health is some of the worst in the area because we lack locally trained doctors and we don<sq>t have a medical school (There are two pharmacy schools in the valley and a few places do nursing but nothing for MDs). There is a branch of UCSF in Fresno, but they train surgeons, maybe one day UC Merced will have a medical school but it won<sq>t be for awhile. If you look at the costal areas you<sq>ll see there are a lot more places for people to train to become doctors, and they tend to stay in those areas which means overall they have better access to medical treatment. One other problem is that medical facilities and specialists are spread out everywhere, the best childrens hospital is in Madera and the best two trauma centers are in Fresno and Modesto but everything else is kind of stuck with whatever they can get. <br>* I know it sounds like I<sq>m putting a lot on UC Merced to fix the problems in the valley, and they have a lot of other challenges of their own (during the budget crisis some people wanted to close the campus to save money, they can<sq>t build past a certain point on campus until they build more expensive infrastructure, ect.) but if you look at what happens to other communities when they<sq>re need a UC campus you<sq>ll see what happens when they can produce their own doctors and have researchers with technical skills available to assist local industries. These are all things that the valley lacks and are the cornerstone to a thriving community which can tackle the problems they<sq>re facing. </p>",

By<colon> Stott, Clifford; Scothern, Martin; Gorringe, Hugo. Policing<colon> A Journal of Policy & Practice. Jun2013, Vol. 7 Issue 2, p210-224. 15p. Abstract<colon> This article provides further analysis of an emerging \u2018liaison\u2019 based approach to the policing of public order in England and Wales (Gorringe, H., Stott, C. and Rosie, M. (2012). \u2018Dialogue Police, Decision Making, and the Management of Public Order During Protest Crowd Events.\u2019 Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling 9(2)<colon> 111\u2013125.). Data is gathered from a range of sources including direct observation of a series of six protest events across two cities in England between May and November 2012. The research was conducted using principles of \u2018participant observation\u2019 within an \u2018action research\u2019 framework (Lewin, K. (1958). Group Decision and Social Change. New York<colon> Holt, Rinehart and Winston.). The qualitative analysis suggests that liaison based approaches are effective where they enhance police capacity for problem solving, conflict reduction, limit setting, and mediating during protest events. It is asserted that liaison based tactics can be undermined, however, through poor understanding of the approach among police commanders and inadequate sensitivity to interactions between police tactics, protest identities, ideology, and history. The implications of the data for understanding wider debates concerning iterative processes between \u2018transgressive\u2019 protest and shifts toward strategic incapacitation are discussed (Gillham, P. F. (2011). \u2018Securitizing America<colon> strategic incapacitation and the policing of protest since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.\u2019 Sociology Compass 5(7)<colon> 636\u2013652.). <br><br>Cop Rock<colon> Protest, Identity, and Dancing Riot Police in Jordan. By<colon> Schwedler, Jillian. Social Movement Studies, Sep2005, Vol. 4 Issue 2, p155-175, 21p Abstract<colon> In January 1997, a diverse group of Jordanians gathered outside of Amman to demonstrate against the opening of the first Israeli trade fair to be held in Jordan. The fair, intended to strengthen economic ties between Israel and Jordan, was organized as a provision of the 1994 peace treaty signed between the two countries. The Jordanian government anticipated a large gathering of protesters and sent several security contingents, including army personnel and riot police. While the protests did not result in violence, they produced a rather strange reaction from the riot police, who at one point began singing and dancing traditional tribal songs. What explains this strange behavior? This article examines two dimensions of the protests that explain the exceptional nature of the response of the police to the challenges of the protesters. First, I explore the mobilization and coordination of disparate groups within Jordanian society (business association, Islamists, communists, and various opposition parties) around the issue of the anti-trade fair demonstrations. Jordan has seen few such large and well-organized protests, particularly where groups across the political spectrum cooperated to mount a single, large-scale event. This coordination produced a particular framing of the challenge to the trade fair that was critical to creating the context in which the riot police (and other state policing agents) responded as they did. Second, I offer an explanation for the strange behavior of the riot police on the day of the largest gathering<colon> as the demonstrators framed their chants and slogans around loyalty to homeland (Jordan), they questioned the loyalty of those who defended the trade fair and accused the various policing agents present of greater loyalty toward Israel than toward Jordan. In response, the riot police sought to demonstrate their own loyalty to Jordan by singing and dancing to traditional tribal songs. Their response demonstrates the deep tensions in Jordan over national identity, that is, the divide between those of Palestinian origin and those (like the royal Hashemite family) of East Bank and western Arabian origin. In effect, the use of tribal songs served as a mechanism that enabled the riot police to challenge the demonstrators themselves around the question of precisely what makes one truly Jordanian. <br><br>Dialogue Police, Decision Making, and the Management of Public Order During Protest Crowd Events. By<colon> Gorringe, Hugo; Stott, Clifford; Rosie, Michael. Journal of Investigative Psychology & Offender Profiling. Jun2012, Vol. 9 Issue 2, p111-125. 15p. Abstract<colon> Following the major riots within England in August 2011, the efficacy of public order police decision making was brought into a sharp focus. None the less, the reform of this mode of policing within the UK was already underway with a strong emphasis upon policing through consent and the need to facilitate peaceful protest through dialogue and communication. This paper reports upon a critical <sq>test case<sq> for this <sq>new approach<sq> by analysing the policing of a series of protests against Government policy across 3 days that surrounded a Government party conference in Sheffield, a large city in the north of England. This paper draws out lessons to be learned from what proved to be a highly successful dialogue-based approach to policing protests. We contend that dialogue and liaison were effective because they allowed for an ongoing dynamic risk assessment that improved command-level decision making and enhanced police proportionality. The subsequent impact upon crowd dynamics allowed for an improved capacity for proactive public order management, encouraged <sq>self-regulation<sq> in the crowd, and avoided the unnecessary police use of force at moments of tension. The implications of the analysis for theory and practice are discussed. <br><br>Facilitating ineffective protest? The policing of the 2009 Edinburgh NATO protests. By<colon> Gorringe, Hugo; Rosie, Michael; Waddington, David; Kominou, Margarita. Policing & Society. Jun2012, Vol. 22 Issue 2, p115-132. 18p. Abstract<colon> This paper reports on innovations in public order policing during the protests surrounding the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Parliamentary Assembly in Edinburgh, November 2009. When masked anarchist protesters determined to \u2018smash NATO\u2019 gathered on the streets on the first morning of the Assembly, they were initially confronted by three plainclothes police negotiators rather than a line of riot police. In this paper, we draw on empirical data to offer an analysis of these developments and gauge the extent to which they meet the stated intentions of the police to \u2018facilitate lawful protest\u2019. Whilst welcoming the shift in attitudes and approach towards political protest, we argue that the accent on facilitation in this operation ultimately appeared neither innovative nor effective in practice and frequently reverted to styles of policing designed to contain protest. <br><br>Protest and policing on October 15th, global day of action<colon> the Italian case. By<colon> della Porta, Donatella; Zamponi, Lorenzo. Policing & Society. Mar2013, Vol. 23 Issue 1, p65-80. 16p. Abstract<colon> Fifteenth October 2011, a global day of anti-austerity action called for by the Spanish indignados, saw hundreds of thousands of protestors converging on Rome for a national march. One of the largest, this Rome event was however one of the most problematic, as it was disrupted by violent protests and the lack of will or capacity by the police to protect peaceful demonstrators. In this article, based on interviews with social movement organisers and police officers as well as documentary analysis, we examine similarities and differences between the 2001 G8 Genoa counter-summit and the demonstration of October 15th in Rome by analysing the specific characteristics in the police use of coercive techniques on the street, negotiation (or lack thereof) and the gathering of information. We then try to explain those characteristics, addressing some aspects of the Italian police organisation, the protest itself and the political system. <br><br>Protesting and Policing in a Multiethnic Authoritarian State<colon> Evidence from Ethiopia. By<colon> Arriola, Leonardo R.. Comparative Politics, Jan2013, Vol. 45 Issue 2, p147-168, 22p Abstract<colon> The antigovernment protests that erupted in one ethnic region of Ethiopia can be attributed to the group<sq>s historical grievances or to its access to mobilizing resources. However, conventional explanations are insufficient in accounting for protest patterns in terms of their geographic distribution or varying levels of violence. The likelihood of protest onset was inversely related to local heterogeneity, intraethnic as well as interethnic. Protest violence spiraled through the interaction between ethnic homogeneity and the government<sq>s policing strategy. Woundings were less likely to occur in localities where protesters were repressed by police forces staffed by their own co-ethnics. <br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>*The* source for exhaustible resource extraction is [Harold Hotelling<sq>s *The Economics of Exhaustible Resources*](http<colon>//link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007<percent>2FBF02464433.pdf) (I hope the link works, never know if I get it because I<sq>m on an institutional network).<br><br>Basically, given the basic economic assumptions, the extraction of exhaustible resources depends on the initial price, the discount rate, and the initial stock. Basically following the principle that price *p* in time period *t* follows a path such that *p(t) = p(0)e^rt*, given the discount factor *r* and an initial price. This basically says that if at any point in time the discounted price of the resource is not equal to all other discounted prices, the owner of the resource would shift extraction to the periods with higher prices - happening over again until the extractions result in equal discounted prices for the entire time to resource depletion (*t=T*). <br><br>Using this condition and a demand function with a given choke price for the resource (the price where demand becomes zero), as well as the constraint that the sum of quantity extracted *q* in each period *t* equals the initial resource stock, extraction is allocated such that demand goes to zero at the same point as the remaining stock of the resource is extracted.<br><br>Now, in this situation, the lower the initial price, the quicker the resource is depleted. Further, the higher the discount factor, the lower the price, ergo the quicker the resource is depleted. In that paper you<sq>ll find a discussion of state control, which makes the case that, to the extent the conditions assumed by Hotelling are feasible, maximum social welfare will be realized by a free-market situation. *However*, the inherent uncertainty associated with resource use and the potentially high discount factor employed by private owners can have negative effects on intergenerational equity and resource extraction paths. In other words, a *well-managed* state control of natural resources can employ a lower more socially-oriented discount factor, leading to higher initial prices, a longer period to depletion period *T*, a more regular extraction path. Further, there are potential benefits from public management of exploration, as it prevents prospectors and wastefulness of overly quick extraction. But state management is available to political capture, especially when democracies exist and rent-seeking is possible. There<sq>s no guarantee a state will employ lower discount rates or be inherently better at exploiting newly discovered resource stocks.<br><br>It<sq>s also worth reading the section on monopolies, which don<sq>t exist as price-takers in the model. Therefore, *q(t)* can be manipulated to affect *p(t)*, leading to a higher *p(0)* and a longer extraction path to depletion.<br><br>tl;dr<colon> Read Hotelling! He addresses the factors that determine extraction and price paths of exhaustible resource extraction. Further, the question of optimum ownership depends on the goal<colon> maximized total welfare (consumer + producer surplus) will likely be maxed by private competition. Intergenerational equity and sustainable resource use may be better in the hands of the state or a well-organized monopoly. But state control is also open to political capture and management issues. In other words, it depends on what benefits we<sq>re interested in and how well the various institutions function!<br><br>Edit<colon> I know it<sq>s not a quantitative study, but it<sq>s worth reading anyway! Also, as Hotelling and others note, it<sq>s going to depend heavily on what the objective is and the capacity of institutions - so hard empirical evidence one way or the other will be difficult to come by.</p>",

Basically, she finds that a fully privatized model tends to be better than fully state owned or even partially state owned. <br><br>I wrote my masters thesis on how oil affects political structures, so I have a list of other resources that might also address this topic, Jones Luong is the first thing that comes to mind while I<sq>m waiting for my flight.

This results in teachers staying longer (the average term in Australia is down to about 5-6 years, and you need a 4 year degree to teach)... Also, teachers in Finland have a high degree of autonomy, they can create their own lessons and units, I think Finland and Australia rank highest in the world in this degree, with the US being closer to China and Korea - this is a really big thing for teachers - you simply cannot *teach* effectively if you have no control of content...<br><br>However, what I feel is the real accomplishment of the Finnish education system is that there is less different *between* schools than *within* them - think about that for a minute...

One reason is because we<sq>ve finally realised that meeting westerners for the first time is very destructive unless it<sq>s handled very, very carefully. It<sq>s almost always followed by epidemics of western diseases that these people don<sq>t have immunities to, usually by the introduction of things like guns, drugs and alcohol that they have no experience of the dangers of, and often by outright attack from people who have an economic interest in something on their land. The other reason is that it<sq>s very unlikely anyone on the world hasn<sq>t heard of <sq>us<sq> yet. They have contact with their neighbours who have contact with us, and often western goods make it to uncontacted people well before western people do. Plus the entire planet is pretty much covered in roads, mines, logging camps, army bases, etc. We have to assume that if people were interested in contacting us they would have done so already, and the evidence is a lot of uncontacted peoples have a long history of being actively hostile to outsiders, for whatever reason. For example the [Sentinelese](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese_people) who shoot at anyone who approaches their island or the [Akunstu](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akuntsu) were nothing more than a rumour because all of their neighbours were frightened of them.<br><br>So the current policy of governments like Brazil which have responsibility for a lot of uncontacted people is to survey and record uncontacted people from a distance\u2014by interviewing their neighbours or in one high-profile example [aerial photography](http<colon>//www.uncontactedtribes.org/brazilphotos)\u2014set up a perimeter and protect their land from encroachment, and then leave the ball in their court.

With the TOMS website listing the average pair of shoes at $54, with a range from $44 to $68, this is a very significant profit, although Mycoskie still claimed that \u201cit\u2019s very tough on us financially, and it\u2019s a sacrifice that we make with a smile, though.\u201d Hard to believe when, even at the least, they\u2019re making a 144 percent profit. <br><br>I think for a while they were making these shoes *in* Ethiopia and other places under conditions that frankly further the poverty and exploitation of these developing nations that *leads* to children not having shoes. Not only that, but there were cases of children losing their calluses because of these shoes, which is normal, and then reverting to going barefoot once the shoes were used up--which caused them to get foot diseases that are one of the reasons TOMS was initially set up. Both of these points have been addressed by TOMS now, and I think their practices have gotten better and the shoes are coordinated so the kids don<sq>t go back to barefoot, but it shows that TOMS didn<sq>t necessarily have good long-term planning beyond their initial <dq>let<sq>s help barefoot kids<dq> approach.<br><br>But on top of that, the idea of giving out shoes to those in need is more like a bandaid than an actual cure, and one that can do more harm to an underdeveloped country than good in many cases. Studies show that the donation of used clothing caused 40 percent of the decline in production and 50 percent of the decline in employment over the period of 1981-2000 in Africa. Because of what honest, good-intentioned people did to help those in need, hundreds of thousands of jobs\u2014543,000 textile workers in Nigeria alone between 1992 and 2006\u2014were lost, as companies shut down due to being undercut by outside aid.<br><br>If you really want to make a change, you can\u2019t artificially pull people out of poverty by giving them things that won\u2019t last\u2014you need to help them find a long-lasting source of income. It\u2019s for that reason that I like the Heifer Project, which for the price of a pair of TOMS Shoes provides a family with animals that will be bred and passed on to others and provide a constant source of income, and Kiva Microfunds, which helps finance microloans to small businesses (who knows, maybe a shoe company) and students in developing countries.<br></p>",

TOMS cheaply manufactures their shoes in China before dropping them off in small villages in Africa. What does that solve? Shoelessness is solved. The people of the village are given shoes- but nothing else. If TOMS were truly interested in helping people, the best solution would be to open up a factory that manufactures shoes. In this case, the people of the village would be employed and have income of their own, to spend on whatever they choose, be it shoes or food or medicine or shelter. TOMS looks at a problem in one dimension, when the real issue is not a lack of shoes, but poverty. Giving someone shoes will not free them of their poverty, only the earning of money can begin to deplete  an individual<sq>s poverty. TOMS is capitalizing on the whole idea of <dq>charity<dq>, by encouraging consumers to purchase a product because they can <dq>feel good about buying something<dq>, while in reality is ultimately an ineffective means of creating change. </p>",

The funny thing though is that there<sq>s excessive politicization of this issue, which leads to blame being laid on foreign workers rather than foreign companies.

Recent reports from the National Institutes of Health, the National Academies, and the American Chemical Society warn that overproduction of STEM PhDs is damaging America\u2019s ability to recruit native-born talent, and advise universities to limit the number of doctorates they produce, especially in the severely glutted life sciences. In June 2012, for instance, the American Chemical Society\u2019s annual survey found record unemployment among its members, with only 38 percent of new PhDs, 50 percent of new master\u2019s graduates, and 33 percent of new bachelor\u2019s graduates in fulltime jobs. Overall, STEM unemployment in the US is more than twice its pre-recession level, according to congressional testimony by Ron Hira, a science-labor-force expert at the Rochester Institute of Technology.<br><br>http<colon>//archives.cjr.org/reports/what_scientist_shortage.php<br><br>>But what \u201cwe all know,\u201d as Senator Cornyn put it, turns out not to be true\u2014and the perpetuation of this myth is discouraging Americans from pursuing scientific careers. Leading experts on the STEM workforce, including Richard Freeman of Harvard, Michael Teitelbaum of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Paula Stephan of Georgia State University, Hal Salzman of Rutgers, Lindsay Lowell of Georgetown, and Norman Matloff of the University of California-Davis, have said for years that the US produces ample numbers of excellent science students.

Simply put, a desire for cheap, skilled labor, within the business world and academia, has fueled assertions\u2014based on flimsy and distorted evidence\u2014that American students lack the interest and ability to pursue careers in science and engineering, and has spurred policies that have flooded the market with foreign STEM workers.

Methods<colon> Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we analyzed a cohort of male subjects, originally in grades 7\u201312, reporting on sexual relationships 7 years later. At baseline, peer network violence was estimated as the average of network members<sq><sq> reports of their frequency of fighting during the past year, and centrality (number of friendships) was measured.

All these countries underwent political transitions in the 1990s. Many explanations point to the legacies of war, socioeconomic underdevelopment, and neoliberal structural reforms.

This article argues that public security reforms carried out during the political transitions shaped the ability of the new regimes to control the violence produced by their own institutions and collaborators. In the analysis of the crisis of public security, it is important to bring the state back. The survival of violent entrepreneurs in the new security apparatus and their relationship with new governing elites foster the conditions for the escalation of violence in northern Central America.<br><br>In other words, the relationship between street gangs, drug cartels, and the government is key.

(PDF [here](http<colon>//www.bpb.de/files/8SQP4F.pdf))<br><br><br>The issues you describe regarding racial segregation and white supremacy gangs in American prisons do not apply as such to German prisons, because of several factors<colon><br><br>* Ever since the late 60s German society has made huge efforts to cope with the evils it committed and allowed during WWII. A lot of laws were implemented to prevent totalitarianism and many educational measures were put into effort in order for the Holocaust and the structural, political and societal Factors that allowed for it to happen never to be forgotten. From the early grades on, children learn about the dark part of the German history. This leads to greater aversity towards the extreme right than in other parts of the world (there are obviously other factors contributing to the democratic stability as well). This does not mean that Germany is <dq>Nazi-free<dq>, but its ideology is definitely refused by a large majority of people. One can assume that even in prison the mechanisms of the anti-totalitarian measures put in place are still active, albeit in a potentially weaker way than outside of the prison walls.<br><br>* Germany does not have a free speech law as tolerant as the USA. Given its past, Hate speech is for instance not protected by law and there are many laws forbidding Nazi imagery and speech (listed in German [here](http<colon>//www.recht-gegen-rechts.de/gesetze-gegen-rechts.html)). <br><br>* Germany<sq>s crime rates are receding ([Source](http<colon>//www.dw.de/crime-rate-drops-to-record-low/a-15093336)) and its prison population is certainly lower than in the US. As there are less prisoners, a good management of prisons is facilitated. To draw on Matticus_Rex<sq>s comment one could say that this leads to a lower level of racial stratification (keeping in mind German society is ethnically less diverse than the American one). As there is less chaos, the need for norms and structures provided by gangs would therefore be lower. <br><br>* Prisons in Germany are run by the federal states, which leads to stronger political supervision of prison population than in a system with privatized prisons, preventing the rise of such groups ([Source](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_Germany))<br><br>* While there certainly are certain groups with right wing tendencies in German prisons, they are not as much a problem as in the US and cannot rely on public display of Nazi imagery as it is forbidden by law (which definitely prevents them from acquiring a certain symbolic power). There are much more groups with ties to organized crime than there are groups enforcing segregation.<br><br>All in all - the German prison system and its social structure is in no way similar to the American one. I could go into further analysis regarding the factor of violence in society and its influence on the social structure of prisons, as well as its ties to racial segregation. One could also look at the factor of antagonism in society and the public sphere and link it to the prison system... <br>I lack both time and sources. Maybe another redditor can help here? </p>",

The most common definition of terrorism is that they intentionally target and inflict violence on **civilians** (1) for the purposes of gaining **political concessions** (2). So we<sq>re not talking about rebels fighting other rebels, football hooligans killing each other or the Corleone family cleaning out the other four crime families.<br><br>As for ethics, traditional just war theory contends that the intentional targeting of civilians can not be justified (see Walzer - Just and Unjust Wars, Ch. 12) but see the other thread for some unconventional takes. <br><br>Even if you sympathise with terrorist goals and grievances, and are willing to accept terrorism if its results are net positive, the thing is that terrorism is often a very poor method for accomplishing political goals (it<sq>s rarely net positive) (at least, since the end of the decolonization struggle). Terrorism is much more ineffective at achieving political goals than attacks on military targets (Abrahms 2006, 2012) or just plain non-violence (Stephan and Chenoweth 2008). <br><br>Terrorism is usually non- or counterproductive because (this is a partial list from the top of my head but the points are all definitely based on the terrorism studies literature)<colon><br><br>* It invites a violent counter-reaction by the target of the attacks.<br>* Democracies elect governments that are *less likely* to compromise.<br>* Governments, democratic or not, get a relatively free hand from the international community and the domestic public to crack down on groups and causes that are linked to terrorism.<br>* Governments become less likely to make concessions when a group resorts to violence against civilians (because they are perceived as maximalist and untrustworthy).<br>* Members of a regime become less likely to shift loyalty to the terrorist cause (because they fear for their lives and can<sq>t trust them).<br>* It does not shift the loyalty of the public (they see terrorism as threatening and extreme, unlike non-violent campaigns).<br><br>When terrorism succeeds, it<sq>s usually when (1) governments are likely to make concessions and when they can not illustrate a credible resolve to expend a lot of effort going after terrorists (2) the causes are widely seen as legitimate. This might explain the fairly high success rate of anti-colonial terrorism (the colonial powers quickly got weary, while terrorists did not necessarily lose support for their cause among their fellow nationals).<br><br>So the answer to your question is<colon> not really.

                "answer": "<p>The classic economic work on discrimination is Gary Becker<sq>s book.... called <dq>The Economics of Discrimination.<dq> Usually discrimination is either framed as being preference-based (<dq>animus<dq>) or signaling-based (<dq>statistical<dq>.) Since economists usually don<sq>t try to *explain* preferences (at least not directly; again, Becker<colon> *de gustibus non est disputandum*) most effort from economists goes towards trying to answer the following three questions<colon><br><br>a) To *what extent* is racial discrimination explainable by animus vs. statistical factors?<br><br>b) To *what extent* is statistical discrimination rationalizable? (Note<colon> This is not saying that statistical discrimination <dq>is okay.<dq>) For example, people are concerned about the fact that if you<sq>ve been unemployed for a long time, it becomes harder to get a job, and this becomes a self-reinforcing problem. But the fact is that employers avoid the long-term unemployed because at least to some extent being in that class is a negative signal. That<sq>s just how it is.<br><br>c) To the extent that statistical discrimination is not rationalizable, what are the cognitive biases underlying its instantiation? (Note<colon> A lot of people are probably irrational in that they have biased beliefs that militate *against* discrimination.) <br><br>Many of the arguments you link are pretty terrible, particularly the Salon one<colon> <dq>Economists see discrimination as a form of economic inefficiency.<dq> No they don<sq>t. Having preferences and indulging them is not presumptively inefficient. Responding to signals is not inefficient. Yes, if signal extraction is noisy you may get *ex post* inefficiencies but you can<sq>t assume *ex ante* inefficiencies.<br><br>Here<sq>s an interesting excerpt<colon><br><br>>In a separate study, Eberhardt found that people are more likely to consider animal language (such as \u201cbarbaric,\u201d \u201canimalistic,\u201d etc.) appropriate and necessary in court cases of Black defendants compared to White defendants. News articles describing Black defendants are more likely to use animal language than articles about White defendants.<br><br>>In addition, news articles of Blacks who received a death sentence contain more animal language than the articles of those with life sentences. \u201cSo not only are Blacks associated with apes, but this association is linked to justifications of violence and death,\u201d Eberhardt concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as though the rules for what moral treatment is get shifted for Black suspects and defendants.\u201d<br><br>Do these racially-valenced findings indicate *irrationality*? It<sq>s tricky to say. It obviously looks bad, but it doesn<sq>t implicate inefficiency. There<sq>s a reason why this research isn<sq>t being spearheaded by economists. The best research in favor of inefficiency-generating discrimination are the field studies where applications are sent out with randomized racial names (gender names are a bit trickier to identify inefficiency from), because these studies attempt to control for statistical discrimination (and heuristics whose expressions would approximate statistical discrimination) in a way that the aforementioned studies don<sq>t (and to be frank, I<sq>m *very* skeptical about the gorilla study - that<sq>s a *huge* effect from a subtle prime. Does anyone know the exact study that this is coming from?) But they don<sq>t give us a strong point estimate of what the costs of discrimination actually are.<br><br>[Edit]<br><br>I should also mention that IAT tests are a good way to identify discrimination, although it<sq>s difficult to label IAT findings as attributable to animus or not. This is getting into territory that economists get uncomfortable with because we<sq>re no longer looking at a choice-based framework for human behavior - but the research is still good. What IAT results mean for real-world behavior is unclear, however.<br><br>[/Edit]<br><br>I think in the end the Salon article rustles my jimmies the most because it appeals to experts (economists) to make a lot of arguments that economists would not make qua economists. We could say that discrimination means that we create less widgets and that<sq>s bad, but it<sq>s not inefficient, anymore than any other preference that distracts us from making widgets can be called inefficient.<br><br>The reluctance of economists to condemn racism as bad *via economic analysis* comes off as a sort of apologism to many, but it<sq>s not. We can call preferences shitty if we want, or excoriate people for discriminating in general, but economics is not the tool that will justify this.<br><br>[Edit 2]<br><br>I realized that I didn<sq>t directly answer the OP<sq>s question, however, so some more points. The incentives (or lack thereof) to stop discriminating can generally be reduced to<colon><br><br>- Indulging in animus-based preferences means you<sq>re trading off something else to indulge the preference. In a highly-competitive market, this can become ruinous. If you don<sq>t, say, hire qualified blacks for your consulting firm because you hate blacks, then you lower the value of the service you provide and this will hurt your business. This is also why competition is often seen as an important mechanism through which animus-based preferences are selected against, and restrictions on competition may give harbor to animus. If you want to infuriate your progressive friends, mention the relationship between racial ideology and unionism in the early 20th century, or the role of minimum wage legislation in keeping women and minorities out of the labor force.<br><br>- Of course, if your customers have animus-based preferences then discrimination in hiring can be sustainable. One of Becker<sq>s most-famous points in *The Economics of Discrimination* is that one would expect manufacturing industries to engage in less discrimination than, say, service industries because racist consumers probably don<sq>t care (much) if blacks stitched their clothes, but do care if blacks are waiting their tables. I think the historical evidence on this is pretty strong.<br><br>- There are often decent incentives to engage in statistical discrimination but people need to understand that the implications of SD being <dq>rational<dq> doesn<sq>t mean that we should predict or condone its widespread deployment in employment decisions or whatever, because whatever<sq>s on your resume should mask the race signal in a lot of cases. However, like I said there<sq>s a good literature indicating that it doesn<sq>t.<br><br>- However, statistical discrimination is rationalizable in a lot of low-information settings and can even be self-reinforcing. Psychologists will point to the stereotype threat literature in particular on this. People tend to see stable path-dependent separating equilibria as bad but... well, that<sq>s a tricky issue (it<sq>s a form of specialization...) Everyone employs statistical discrimination at some margin in their everyday lives and the norms we use to condemn or justify its specific invocations tend to be jointly-incoherent. But most norms are that way when you bundle enough of them together.<br><br>[/Edit 2]</p>",

                "answer": "<p>No. It<sq>s absolutely untrue. Private charities are extremely inefficient (both by design and by nature) in providing any sort of long term assistance. They have some success in assisting families in deep crisis (food banks, soup kitchens, and the like) but providing a stable source of food for a family is outside both their design (often they limit how often people can come to the food bank and very regularly run short before assisting most families in the area) and the nature of private social services. [Chaves and Tsitsos](http<colon>//nvs.sagepub.com/content/30/4/660.full.pdf+html) cover this particularly well. What they find is that private faith based charities (which make up the vast majority of private charities) are actually quite bad at helping families that consistently experience crisis. Those who do make an effort at helping those families often do so by helping them access state supplied social services (SNAP being one such program). What they find is that social services from private charities are only successful when coupled with state run programs. They don<sq>t focus their research here, but they seem to imply this is because private charities lack the authority, reach, and capacity of state run programs. <br><br>Charities are also quite well known for consuming part of the funds donated for a variety of purposes. [This CNN article](http<colon>//money.cnn.com/2013/05/24/pf/donations-charities/) highlights a few massive charities who donate 85<percent> or so on average but these charities are also much larger and given greater attention in terms of where money goes. Local charities, which have much less oversight and responsibility to report their flow, are usually going to average out around 60<percent>-70<percent> going to aid. This is likely even lower for religious charities who use these funds for extremely short-term relief and <sq>outreach<sq> which they define as charity. Conversely, every cent of your tax money set aside for SNAP or whatever program goes directly to that program. In terms of per dollar outcome, state run social services are more effective (although one can easily observe that you pay other taxes to pay for those salaries for the people who work in those programs). <br><br>More analytically, the answer remains no. People who adhere to anti-government/anti-taxation ideologies are also typically anti-utilitarianism and focused on <sq>greed is good<sq> sorts of ethos. Not surprisingly, they do very little to help others. Their ideology views these people as lazy, unwilling to provide for themselves, and absolves them of any social responsibility. In terms of basic psychology, we receive greater pleasure by doing good things for ourselves more than we do by doing good things for others. We have less incentive to act on our own to support others and this exacerbates when you operate within a moral framework that emphasizes individualism and egotism. This is why most private charities are religious in nature - religious individuals are morally obligated to help. In particular, we see that Catholics and mainline Protestants (Lutherans, Methodists, ect) are the ones more active in charity. Evangelical churches do very little charity and prefer instead to spend donations on <sq>outreach<sq> or political agendas. <br><br>Less thoughtfully, if people actually donated to charities to help people, we wouldn<sq>t need state run programs, would we? There<sq>s a very obvious history in the US alone that explains why the social welfare state exists. If anything, the welfare state in the United States needs to be expanded. I doubt that will happen, but who knows.<br><br>**tldr** Nope. People are selfish and the people who get mad about taxes don<sq>t operate in a moral system where charity is seen as a good or a necessity. <br><br>Edit<colon> Link updated and spelling. </p>",

Indira Gandhi<sq>s assisntation was inspired because some Sikh militants were alleged to be operating in the holiest Sikh site and Gandhi ordered the [Indian army to move in in force](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Blue_Star).<br><br>Buddhism, well, there was some Buddhist rhetoric in the [Sri Lanka civil war](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_lanka_civil_war), but it<sq>s hard to say whether that was an <dq>ethnic conflict<dq> or a <dq>religious conflict<dq> (it was both, but ethnicity was invoked more often than religion).  The example of [Bodu Bala Sena](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodu_Bala_Sena) is listed below and may prove instructive, but it cannot be divorced from ideas about making Sri Lanka into a Sinhalese (and therefore at least nominally Buddhist) nation-state.  More recently, there has been ethnic strife in Burma where Buddhists have been targeting Muslims.  For a slightly sensational take on it, [here<sq>s a *Vice* article on the subject](http<colon>//www.vice.com/read/is-burmas-anti-muslim-violence-led-by-buddhist-neo-nazis) called <dq>Is Burma<sq>s Anti-Muslim Violence Led by Buddhist Neo-Nazis?<dq>  In Thailand, there has been also some nationalist conflict between the majority Thevada Buddhist Thais and various minorities, especially the Muslims in the South, though I don<sq>t know to what degree religious rhetoric is involved.<br><br>Jain extremism is like Quaker extremism<colon> it<sq>s just really [pacifistic](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism#Non-violence).  Jain extremists are so worried about killing insects, etc. that they sweep in front of themselves, wear muslin over their mouths (to prevent accidental ingesting small creatures), etc.  Don<sq>t think this is something that has to do with the Jain religion; Buddhist discourse traditionally stresses the same things as Jainism does.  Rather, this is because Jains do not have their own nation-state.  <br><br>As you can see from the examples above, it<sq>s hard to separate the violence of religious extremism from national violence, just as (close to home) it<sq>s hard to separate out American/European anti-Muslim rhetoric from both Christianity and Judaism on one hand and the per-existing ideas of national belonging on the other.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I can only make a very brief post right now, focusing on Christian/Muslim-Societies. Sorry for any inaccuracies, I<sq>ve never written on this topic in English. Also I<sq>m unable to read any Arabic so all of my sources have either been translated into English or German. Whenever I don<sq>t mention a specific source it<sq>s from the one of the books listed at the end.<br><br>* The view on same-gender sex in <dq>pre-modern<dq> times is drastically different between christian and muslim societies, the key difference being between the idea of <dq>sodomy<dq> in Christianity and <dq>liwat<dq> (or liw\u0101t) in Islam.<br><br>* Sodomy tended to be a very loose <dq>catch-all<dq> term, not exclusively restricted to male-male intercourse(1) and not being as strict of an identity (sodomite) as the later idea of being a <dq>homosexual<dq>. To quote Foucault<colon><br><br>   ><dq>The sodomite was a recidivist, but the homosexual is now a species.<dq><br><br>* Liwat on the other hand was a term that came from islamic law (*fiqh*), which despite being religiously motivated was very precise. Liwat describes the act of penetrating an anus up until the glans, no matter the gender of the penetrated. Thus Liwat exclusively describes an act and can<sq>t be translated into Sodomy, Homosexuality or Pederasty (which is quite a common mistake).<br><br>* The origin of Liwat is a bit hazy. There<sq>s no direct mentioning in the Quoran, the closest is the condemnation of the Sodomites in Sure VII, V80f. though that just mentions men sleeping with men and no punishment for them. Later in Sura IV, V16 there<sq>s a concrete example for a punishment but it is very much debated if it applies exclusively to Liwat or to fornication (*zina*) in general. Some like [A<sq>la Maududi](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abul_A<sq>la_Maududi) also claim that this Sura can<sq>t be applied to Liwat in any way.<br>* The Hadiths (Mohammed<sq>s sayings) are more explicit about the condemnation of Liwat<colon><br>> <dq>If anyone [resorts to a diviner and believes in what he says (according) to the version of Musa) or] has intercourse with his wife (according to the agreed version) when she is menstruating, or has intercourse with his wife through her anus, he has nothing to do with what has been sent down to Muhammad.<dq>(2)<br><br>* The problem with the Hadiths is that<sq>s it very difficult to tell what is actually from Muhammed and what was latter written or outright forged for whatever reason. One of the early examples for Liwat sentences come from the first Kalifs, Abu Bakr and <sq>Ali ibn Abi Talib, who executed the culprits. However it<sq>s unclear whether that was interpretation of existing law or a sovereign decision that was legitimated in retrospect. There<sq>s also the growing influence of the eastern-roman christian and jewish philosophy during that period, which might serve as an explanation for the change to the harsh(3). The inclusion of Liwat in the *fiqh* might then have served as a way to keep despotism in check.<br><br>* The next topic (which I might add later) are the various schools within *fiqh* and the punishment of Liwat according to each, which tends to vary a lot.<br><br>Unfortunately two of the best books on the topic, *Die Vertreibung aus dem Serail<colon> Europa und die Heteronormalisierung der islamischen Welt* by Georg Klauda and Schmitt, Arno, liw\u0101t im fiqh<colon> M\u00e4nnliche Homosexualit\u00e4t?,are only available in German.

I<sq>m not going to elaborate on this but [Foucault wrote quite extensively on this topic](http<colon>//www.ipce.info/ipceweb/Library/history_of_sexuality.htm) and the transformation from sodomy (an act) into homosexuality (an identity). Bottomline is that the idea of a homosexual identity is a rather young concept, the [Molly house](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_house) of the 18th century being one of the earliest examples. The modern arabic for Homosexuality, *schudud dschinsi* (from *sch\u0101dd* and *dschins*), is even younger, spreading in the 40s and 50s of the 20th century.<br><br><br>2 [Source](http<colon>//www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=29&translator=3&start=0&number=3895#3895)<br><br>3 see  Greenberg, David F., The Construction of Homosexuality, Chicago<colon> University of Chicago Press, 1993, S.173</p>",

I<sq>m reposting (with edits) the relevant part of my answer here<colon><br><br>Basically, there<sq>s only two ways buildings get buried. The first is if the building is constructed in a depositional environment. Often times ancient settlements are built in such environments because they make for better agricultural land. For example, a river floodplain will often have large illuvial deposits from multiple inundations. The relative concentration of nutrients in the soil (e<colon> due to frequent flooding) makes it perfect for farming, but it also means that when the settlement is abandoned any remaining material culture will get buried by subsequent deposits.<br><br>The second way buildings get in the ground is if people bury them. This happens both intentionally (some cultures used <dq>termination rituals<dq> to bury things when they<sq>re done using them) or unintentionally, as in multiple constructions. Say your house gets destroyed by a fire, for example. What you<sq>re left with is a pile of rubble, which includes the foundation and part of the old walls (and sometimes stuff that happened to be in the house as well). Often times, it<sq>s easier to rebuild it by simply paving over the old foundation rather than clearing it out. But that means that the old foundation (and some other rubble, probably) is still there, buried beneath the new foundation. In regions where there was continuous occupation over hundreds or thousands of years, you can get many subsequent <dq>houses<dq> stacked on top of each other as people keep building over old foundations.

Another problem not mentioned is that in UCR, only the <dq>most serious offence<dq> is counted, and it counts as one unit -- even if a person has been arrested for. As stated [here, on the StatsCan website,](http<colon>//www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3302&Item_Id=1044&lang=en#b7)<br><dq>It is difficult to make comparisons between data reported by police and data from other sectors of the criminal justice system (i.e., courts and corrections). There is no single unit of count (i.e., incidents, offences, charges, cases or persons) which is defined consistently across the major sectors of the justice system. As well, charges actually laid can be different from the most serious offence by which incidents are categorized. In addition, the number and type of charges laid by police may change at the pre-court stage or during the court process. Time lags between the various stages of the justice process also make comparisons difficult.<dq><br><br>So that further complicates things. <br><br>My background is in Sociology, and coming from that perspective, I would also add that there is a phenomenological limitation to the self-reporting surveys, as what one person considers a <dq>sexual assault<dq> might not be considered a <dq>sexual assault<dq> (or other crime being measured) by another person. For example, someone who does not realize that they can say <dq>no<dq> to his/her partner. Likewise, someone who gets blackout drunk and gets raped while blacked out may consider that their own night of bad decisions, as opposed to rape.<br><br>EDIT<colon> What I forgot to state<colon> Basically, there are a number of limitations to statistics about certain crimes, such as sexual assault, and it<sq>s hard to confidently state how accurate they are for a variety of reasons described above. <br><br>Also, OP, was there a particular country that you were looking to get information about, or were you asking in general?</p>",

A lot of in comes down to fringe benefits.  A lot more of workers total compensation is coming in the form of health benefits, retirement contribution, paid leave, and other non-cash payments  than it was thirty years ago.

                "answer": "<p>If you<sq>re asking specifically about Pinker<sq>s work on the matter then there<sq>s some glaring methodological errors and questionable extrapolations. For all of reddit<sq>s armchair rationality and edgy atheism, Stephen Pinker<sq>s use of the Bible and the Iliad as sources to conclude that history was more violent than today sure gets a surprisingly automatic pass for some reason.<br><br>While I think that it<sq>s fair to assert that there may have been more inter-tribal warfare over resources etc. in pre-modern times that would only be the case under certain very specific conditions and the fact of the matter is that protracted international warfare requires a level of scientific development, infrastructure, population, agricultural production, communication and logistical support to make something like a World War completely exclusive to being beyond a specific level of [industrial development](http<colon>//www.flowofhistory.com/units/etc/19/FC126).<br><br>While historical examples of wars might *seem* tempting to paint as vast, bloody affairs in comparison to today<sq>s humdrum suburban life in our cozy little corner of the world, the fact of the matter is that there are many parts of the world which are the locations of significant violence and war. That<sq>s not to mention that there is a whole lot of violence which mostly goes unseen such as domestic violence. And I think a lot of this temptation is the hangover of early liberal thought from the fallacious [Hobbesian notion of the life of man in his natural state as being <dq>solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short<dq>](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(book\\)#Part_I<colon>_Of_Man) as well as resting on the liberal mainstays of [meliorism](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meliorism) and the [myth of progress](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea_of_Progress) &mdash; it<sq>s a bitter pill to swallow if you find yourself considering the fact that [colonialism, imperialism,](http<colon>//www.academia.edu/1608087/Colonial_Dynamics_of_Genocide_Imperialism_Identity_and_Mass_Violence) industrialization and their reverberations have brought about untold amounts of violence.<br><br>Another part of the story is the fact that for the first time in history the world has found itself in a stalemate<colon> rather than global powers fighting one another directly or through skirmishes to try and wrest colonies from the other, there was one invention which I<sq>d argue was the greatest contribution to world peace that we have ever seen &mdash; the invention of nuclear weapons. Rather than the Cold War being all-out war, or war of any traditional measure whatsoever, it was a competition of production and economic growth and (largely) symbolic victories such as the space race (though there is no coincidence that the rocket science used to launch space shuttles was a display of each country<sq>s capabilities of precision trajectory plotting and control of payload delivery, and it<sq>s no accident that the invention and deployment of satellites was crucial in surveillance and the targeting of weapons which was the lesser acknowledged aspect of the space race). While the Cold War war terrifying and in no small part one of the closest brushes humanity has had with obliteration (or rather a series of near-misses ^^[1](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov) ^^[2](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov) ^^[3](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis) ^^^^of ^^^^course ) the fact of the matter is that it was a war in name only. There were no huge clashes of immense armies, despite the buildup of forces and militarization of strategic locations. And why? Well in many regards because if things got too close to a full blown war of if one side left the other so crippled as to be moribund then there was every chance that this would bring about mutually assured destruction with a chain reaction of nukes being launched from both sides. So by virtue of this, we have a somewhat uneasy nuclear-powered peace that will probably prevent another World War from ever happening, and I think it helps to explain the proxy wars and geopolitical jostling that we see today as each big regional power flexes its muscles and attempts to expand its sphere of influence in mostly less-than war terms (though there are still wars occurring, it<sq>s not one large player against another the way it has often been in the past and I don<sq>t expect to see any direct conflicts between any big players as we move forward for the reasons above).<br><br>So in that regard I<sq>d say that a Cold War and post-cold war era is the most peaceful time since industrialization but only in respect to wars rather than expanding the scope to other kinds of violence and so on. But as for prior to this period it<sq>s very difficult to say clearly, and especially without appealing to a pop-history notion of the bloodthirsty Mongol golden horde destroying everything in its wake (when in actual fact the Mongol empire, while being ruthless and incredibly successful in a military sense, [it was actually rather peaceful for the territories within the empire itself](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Mongolica) broadly speaking) etc. and without appealing to the idea that we<sq>re on some predestined scientific or social path to achieve complete peace through better living, all it leaves us with is scraps of history and their myriad interpretations as a method of trying to quantify peace/war/death/violence, but worse than that it<sq>s largely just broad estimations and idle speculation.<br><br>(I<sq>m not trying to paint the discipline of history in a bad light here, and in fact there is an incredibly rigorous process of reaching academic consensus on the estimated figures for things like the sizes of armies in the war of the roses, but to try and draw *all* of that together across *all* of human history is a tall order, especially when a huge slice of history comes from the places that had accurate, consistent, well-preserved recordings which leaves archaeology and anthropology to try and fill in all of the many gaps that history cannot fill for this purpose. I was speaking in broad brushstrokes to try and get the message across as succinctly as possible [ha!] and I<sq>ve failed miserably even at that so I couldn<sq>t take on the task of adequately representing the role of history as an academic discipline on top of that. Suffice it to say that even just *outlining* a general response to Pinker<sq>s assertion is incredibly vast and complicated that it<sq>s very tempting to rely on generalizations and oversimplifications that actually making the assertion itself is almost certainly going to invoke the same approach.)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Mathematically, there is something that prevents capitalism from working. It<sq>s called the rate of profit. And there is a tendency for it to fall over time (with countervailing tendencies). This is called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall which was described originally (incorrectly) by bourgeois economists (Smith and Ricardo) but then fixed by Karl Marx in Capital Volume 3.<br><br>The reason as to why this happens is kinda hard to wrap your head around, especially since I would have to basically describe Capital to you for everything to make sense. So I<sq>ll try to do a tl;dr version. Keep in mind that value cannot be made in exchange (Marx thoroughly disproves that in chapter 5 of volume 1) and therefore there must be a commodity that produces value (labor). Furthermore, keep in mind that the labor theory of value relies on the average labor time it takes to make a commodity (socially necessary labor time or SNLT). If it takes 5 hours to make a shoe and it takes me 10 hours, it does not make my shoe more valuable.<br><br>There are 3 variables I<sq>m going to look at<colon> c, v, and s. C is constant capital (raw materials and machines for example), v is variable capital (labor), and s is surplus value (unpaid labor). Over time, capitalists find new ways to increase productivity. A computer, giant drills, cars, whatever it may be. For the capitalist that uses it first, he can produce more items than everybody else (the labor time for his is less than the SNLT) and he starts to put everybody else out of business. His profits are super profits, and that<sq>s why he looks for these new inventions. When everybody else catches up, the SNLT goes down and therefore the value of each object goes down too.<br><br>Unfortunately for the capitalists, these machines (the c) are not free. The workers are still working as much as they ever are, but the costs have gone up. Therefore what we would call the organic composition of capital (OCC) (which is the ratio between c and v<colon> c/v) has increased. What does this mean? Well, now let<sq>s look at profits. Profits would be s/(c+v). Over time OCC raises, so v becomes irrelevant. So then the equation would become s/c. But wait a second, we know that s is unpaid labor. Unless workers work longer (or there are more of them) or are getting paid less, s isn<sq>t going to get bigger. So the more the OCC raises, the smaller profits are going to be. This is exactly what happens, and so something has to give when profits fall too low. This is a type of crisis (recession for example). The price of c in this profitability crisis falls, so then profits are at least partially restored. Then the crisis for a while is resolved.<br><br>Again more bad news for the capitalists. This countervailing tendency isn<sq>t enough (there are others but they are less powerful so I<sq>m going to ignore them for this post) to really restore profit back to there highest point. Profitability is going down, and has been for a long time. Andrew Kliman in his book The Failure of Capitalist Production<colon> Underlying Causes of the Great Recession talks about profitability with data included. Esteban Maito also came out with a paper recently where he shows the rate of profit since the [19th century](https<colon>//thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/maito-esteban-the-historical-transience-of-capital-the-downward-tren-in-the-rate-of-profit-since-xix-century.pdf).<br><br>I wrote this kinda quickly so I hope I didn<sq>t condense too much.<br><br>Resources<colon><br><br>Kliman, Andrew.

David<sq> Harvey<sq>s [17 Contradictions and the End of Capitalism](http<colon>//www.amazon.co.uk/Seventeen-Contradictions-Capitalism-David-Harvey/dp/1781251606) is a pretty readable introduction to this way of thinking by one of the leading living scholars of marxism. <br><br>There is a lot written on this topic, but one of the major contradictions is related to the conflict between capitalists (the people who own businesses) and workers (the people who make things for the business). Capitalists need to maximize their profit because they<sq>ve borrowed money to invest in their business. In mature markets, one of the only ways to make a profit is to reduce your workers<sq> wages or to employ fewer of them by being more productive (which is what those investments do, but new machines to make fewer workers more productive). <br><br>But.....those workers use those wages to buy products. If their wages drop too low, they can<sq>t buy more products, meaning that profit drops. To counteract this capitalists will have to reduce their prices, and the only way to do this is to lower wages! <br><br>So, obviously capitalism hasn<sq>t collapsed yet. Why not given this inherent contradiction? One thing that capitalists can do to forestall a crisis is to open up new markets. You can go to low cost regions to find cheeper workers or you can find new customers somewhere else. But this can only last so long, there are developing markets but there really aren<sq>t that many untapped markets. Capitalists are still trying though. The sub-prime mortgage crisis was in many ways an attempt to create new markets in the developed world by providing cheep credit to people who no longer had high enough wages to consume. <br><br>There are other arguments about why capitalism doesn<sq>t collapse given the internalized contradictions. [Regulation theory](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_school) argues that the state plays an important role in creating stable markets for capitalism to grow by negotiating the implicit contract between capital and labour. </p>",

However, as we have discussed, it is simply not the case that the research literature stacks up so evenly. Rather, the research leans heavily toward the finding of disemployment effects.<br><br>>Based on the extensive research we have done, and our reading of the research done by others, we arrive at the following four main conclusions regarding the outcomes that are central to policy debate about minimum wages. First, minimum wages reduce employment opportunities for less-skilled workers, especially those who are most directly affected by the minimum wage. Second, although minimum wages compress the wage distribution, because of employment and hours declines among those whose wages are most affected by minimum wage increases, a higher minimum wage tends to reduce rather than to increase the earnings of the lowest-skilled individuals. Third, minimum wages do not, on net, reduce poverty or otherwise help low-income families, but primarily redistribute income among low-income families and may increase poverty. Fourth, minimum wages appear to have adverse longer-run effects on wages and earnings, in part because they hinder the acquisition of human capital.</p>",

Both studies are consistent with our predictions. We suggest that this theory of anthropomorphism can help to explain when people are likely to attribute humanlike traits to nonhuman agents, and provides insight into the inverse process of dehumanization in which people fail to attribute human characteristics to other humans. <br><br>Waytz, A., Morewedge, C.K., Epley, N., Monteleone, G., Gao, J., & Cacioppo, J.T.

Neuroimaging data demonstrated that the neural correlates of this process are similar to those engaged when mentalizing other humans.

                "answer": "<p>There<sq>s not really an easy way to answer these questions. On one hand - yes, high-level policymakers are aware of the issues and are concerned. On the other, a lot of the policy that needs to get made in order to improve our national cybersecurity posture has been subjected to a lot of partisan bickering. <br><br>The recent [Executive Order](http<colon>//www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity) from the Obama administration tackles a big chunk of the problem<colon> information sharing between government agencies. Previously, a lot of legal walls between siloed information centers in government kept threat information from being thoroughly digested by various stakeholders across government. The Cyber EO has kicked off the process to rectify this. Similarly, the EO has started a process to create information sharing from the US government to the private sector - which controls 85<percent> of our critical infrastructure (power, water, financial systems, etc.). Through providing better threat intel, as well as offering technical support services, there is a lot of promise that the US government will actually improve national cybersecurity over substantially over the next few years.<br><br>But why hasn<sq>t this happened sooner? Well, it could have happened last summer in Congress, but the bill (originally written by Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins) was killed by aggressive [GOP and private-sector opponents](http<colon>//www.uschamber.com/issues/letters/2012/key-vote-letter-s-3414-cybersecurity-act-2012<percent>E2<percent>80<percent>9D) who wanted this activity to be housed in the military (read<colon> the NSA) rather than the DHS (a civilian agency). Similarly, the still-unresolved question about how the government might source threat information from the private sector to improve its understanding of the vulnerability landscape is going to cause a lot of trouble. This is what the once-dead-now-alive-again bill [CISPA](https<colon>//www.cdt.org/blogs/leslie-harris/1502cispa-still-fundamentally-flawed) tries to tackle - but IMHO, very badly.<br><br>In terms of public outcry, it is hard to get people impassioned about the issue. There is still a public impression that technical/cyber issues aren<sq>t about <dq>them<dq> - they<sq>re about white guys with glasses in basements. There has been major reluctance for a long time from many legislators to engage on this issue because it requires a lot of education to form an intelligent opinion - and very few staffers who support legislators have expertise in this area. This is changing rapidly, but it has put us behind the ball. one thing Congress and the US government has done is make some very smart investments in the future - programs like the NSF<sq>s Scholarship for Service are bringing a number of young, technically-sophisticated new employees into government to tackle a lot of the unresolved issues.<br><br>China is by no means the only player in this space. A previous member of the National Security Council said this summer that no-one is talking about what the Russians are doing because, <dq>they<sq>re much better at not getting caught.<dq> Now, this is up for debate, but these tools are out there - and everyone who has the ability is taking advantage of them. This includes the United States. Now, to what extent, and with what kind of cooperation with the private sector? Hopefully that doesn<sq>t become public information any time soon. <br><br>The question about economic competitiveness is a tough one - because it is really hard to measure in the short term. One good example is what was known as [Operation Nightdragon](http<colon>//www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-global-energy-cyberattacks-night-dragon.pdf), in which Chinese hackers obtained proprietary emails from American companies about bidding for oil and gas contracts in Africa, and provided that info to their Chinese equivalents - allowing Chinese state-sponsored companies to undercut the American<sq>s offers and secure the contracts. <br><br>EDIT<colon> I talked about some of these issues [in my AMA](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/13iosj/i_am_a_public_policy_wonk_ask_me_almost_anything/) a while back.<br><br>EDIT2<colon> typos and fixed link in last para<br></p>",

Of course the [Pentagon](http<colon>//killerapps.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/01/28/dod_no_formal_decision_on_expanding_cyber_command_yet) was quick to deny.  A week ago, Obama signed an [executive order](http<colon>//killerapps.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/02/12/obama_signs_cyber_security_executive_order) outlining plans for more cyber security (a copy of the order is at the end of the article).  Just today, the [White House](http<colon>//killerapps.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/02/19/white_house_we_are_talking_cyber_espionage_with_china) said they are taking cyber espionage with China seriously.  <br><br>So if you are worried about the US government<sq>s response to any real or perceived cyber security threats, some good Americans in Washington and the Pentagon in particular have you covered.  <br><br>A quick [Google search](https<colon>//www.google.com/search?sitesearch=foreignpolicy.com&q=cyber) will give you more information than you have time for.  <br><br>So to answer your questions<colon> <br><br>1.   It would be better if you read up on the situation yourself (from several sources) instead of taking any one person<sq>s explanation.  To be clear, China is not the only cyber threat, though they appear to be the most potent.  <br><br>2.  Take a look at the articles above.  Cyber is a new form of warfare where it is not clear what constitutes an <sq>attack<sq> worthy of retaliation.  How do we know where the attack came from?  Who was responsible?  Was it state sanctioned?  As you can imagine, there is much room for [plausible deniability](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability) from any sovereign state.  The US is just now taking the necessary steps to defend ourselves.  Is it enough?  Time will tell.<br><br>3.  Not many people understand cyber security and the threats therein.  Additionally, cyber attacks are usually discrete and targeted.  Not quite the same impact as [some portray](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_Bv0bzoO78).  <br><br>4.  That is difficult to say.  But any credible national security threat is a threat to our economic competitiveness and prosperity.  Imagine if someone hacked the New York Stock Exchange and disrupted activity for just a day.  What monetary impact would that have?  What non-monetary impact to trust and confidence would that have?  <br><br>And as always, BE SKEPTICAL.

I<sq>ll fill you in on some of the historical context you<sq>re asking for.  I<sq>m an anthropologist, and my area of study is social movements, and I work presently with a union, so if you have some more specific questions, let me know.  The history is something I am only sort of familiar with, so the following may be a bit incomplete or simplistic.<br><br>Looking solely at the impacts of unions on the market ignores the human condition.  You can<sq>t quantify in market terms (or at the least, this isn<sq>t the most illuminating way to approach the subject of) human suffering, or poor work conditions, or the public outrage and social conditions that led to the formation of unions in the first place.<br><br>http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire<br><br>The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire was a tremendously deadly industrial accident that claimed so many lives because of the poor workplace conditions.  Locked fire exits, oil-soaked rags on the floor... you can read the wiki yourself, but the end result was the public on the streets of New York stood in horror watching women (some children) jumping from the high floors to the ground below, just so that the families could have the bodies and they could be buried instead of burned.  Fingernails of the workers were found embedded in the locked fire escape doors, sealed shut to prevent petty theft of fabrics and unauthorized breaks.  Pretty awful stuff.<br><br>Why did these conditions exist to begin with?  Well, generally speaking, the employers hold a lot more power than the employees.  They control wages, and the incentives to create a safe working environment and treat employees properly did not outweigh the incentives of the profits reaped by not doing so.<br><br>So, how do we fix this?  Change the incentives.  Government regulation is one way, but you could also change the balance of power between employees and employers.  Unions are one way to do this.  Through collective action, employees get a lot of bargaining power.  How do we get the momentum and support and social changes necessary for all that change and organizing?  Well, unfortunately it took one of the worst tragedies in New York history for that, but there<sq>s some of the historical context you may have been missing- the specific <dq>why<dq> the unions formed when and how they did.<br><br>Today, there<sq>s still a lot of deplorable conditions even here in the States, and they<sq>re getting worse in many places as the power of unions declines and we move to a more service-based economy.  However, they<sq>re worse still overseas where we<sq>ve sent our manufacturing.  In India, equally deadly fires under very similar conditions are not uncommon today, and India is ripe for its own emergence of labor unions and the sort of workplace change that characterized the wake of the Triangle fire.  Workplace conditions in these sort of industries resemble how they were in the States at the turn of the century, and while there are certainly a lot of factors that distinguish the two, it<sq>s still a good comparison to make.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>No or at least very little. It is capitalist ideology that - after the fact - explains the relative state of a countries economy via the <sq>work ethic<sq>. This ideology evidently serves as self-gratifying for the developed countries who see their advances in terms of their own effort and not the exploitation of less developed countries (via imperialism, neocolonialism, debt-bondage, currency domination and so on). The talk of working hard and laziness is also a crucial part of capitalist ideology in general which bases itself on an ideal of meritocracy, of individual work effort - and individual self-interest - equaling general social good. Of course pretty much all sociological and empirical studies deny this. Not only does social achievement of individuals not dictated by their rate of work but by other more central social forces such as class, wealth, race, gender, patronage and so on. Similarly even in economics the productivity of individual workers is not effective on their wage generally; incomes of CEOs etc. have risen by as much as 250 times since the 1980s whereas the average workers incomes has essentially stagnated in real terms. Are we to assume from this that CEOs have worked 250x harder over that period? In fact most cases of profit for financial institutions are due to causes independent of CEOs actions, from which they nevertheless benefit. A study^1 of corporate performance in Britain and the United States looked at the companies that make up the FTSE 100 index in Britain and the S&P 500 in the US and found that executive income is rarely justified by improved performance. Two decades of free market reforms has produced a situation which has refuted the idea that a workers wage equals their marginal productivity.^2<br><br>This capitalist ideology is of course exceedingly strong. It compels people to work and work hard under the claim it serves themselves and will grant rewards. Insofar as that<sq>s rarely the case the ideology is revealed to be just what it is, something which motivates people to work hard for capital to increase their profit rate. The ideology is also used as a weapon of attack. Recently the north Europeans have been utilised that discourse against Greeks. That their crisis - and that of southern Europe generally - merely reflects the lazy culture of those countries. This is the *Protestant Ethic* for the 21st Century. [And though it<sq>s totally a myth](http<colon>//www.newstatesman.com/blogs/world-affairs/2012/05/exploding-myth-feckless-lazy-greeks), it is interesting why this is a moral point of critique and a moral justification for northern dis-concern. Just as capitalism claims it<sq>s origins in the hard and inventive worker who rose above the pack, poverty or social ills are always cast against it. The individual is the beginning and end of capitalist ideology. Poverty is a consequences of individual choice. Economic crisis comes from outside the capitalist system from individual error, corruption or deceit. Capitalist ideology simultaneously casts an ideal to which we must all follow whilst constructing a discourse in which those who refuse to follow it become worthy of pain, immoral etc. Capitalism changed morality whilst posing <sq>its norms and morality<sq> as the universal and inevitable morality of humanity; this is the basis of any [cultural hegemony](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony). [The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas](https<colon>//www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm).

First, the overall response rate for the 2011 NISVS survey was relatively low (33.1<percent>). However, the cooperation rate was high (83.5<percent>), and multiple efforts were made to reduce the likelihood of nonresponse and noncoverage bias. These included a nonresponse follow-up in which randomly selected nonresponders were contacted again and offered an increased incentive for participation as well as the inclusion of a cellular telephone sample. Second, although NISVS captures a broad range of self-reported victimization experiences, it is likely that the estimates presented underestimate the prevalence of sexual violence, stalking, and intimate partner violence (18). Victims who are involved in violent relationships or who have recently experienced severe forms of violence might be less likely to participate in surveys or might not be willing to disclose their experiences because of unresolved emotional trauma or concern for their safety, among other reasons. Third, a telephone survey might be less likely to capture some populations that could be at higher risk for victimization (e.g., persons living in nursing homes, military bases, prisons, or shelters, or those who are homeless). Fourth, self-reported data are vulnerable to recall bias because respondents might believe that events occurred closer in time than they did in actuality (i.e., telescoping), and this type of bias might particularly affect 12-month prevalence estimates. Finally, follow-up questions were designed to reflect the victim<sq>s experience with each perpetrator across the victim<sq>s lifetime and there were limitations associated with how these questions were asked. Respondents were asked about the impact from any of the violence inflicted by each perpetrator. Therefore, the impact of specific intimate partner violence behaviors cannot be assessed. Also, because victims<sq> reports of the age and relationship at the time any violence began with each perpetrator were used, it was not always possible to assess the age or relationship at the time specific types of intimate partner violence occurred.<br><br>Lastly, reading your other responses - <sq>legal evidence<sq> and <sq>scientific evidence<sq> are two very different things.

Accepting the principals of neoclassical economics, the economic advantages of buying local produce over trading for produce from afar depends ultimately on the varying levels of comparative advantage between the actors. <br><br>In that sense, the economic value gained to a local economy by sourcing its produce from within rather than trading it would depend on the opportunity costs of producing and consuming locally versus producing and trading away or not-producing and trading in. It seems common sense to say <sq>buying locally<sq> helps the local economy by giving money to farmers. But it only does so as compared to an alternative scenario to the extent that (1) the farmers can not obtain a better deal trading away and (2) the other actors in the economy cannot obtain a better deal trading produce in and use the saved costs towards other more advantageous economic ends.<br><br>The argument often trends towards saying that <sq>if we don<sq>t support our local farmers, they will go out of business<sq> - the more populist arguments you allude to. And that may well be an extra-economic concern over and beyond the basic issue of economic efficiency (i.e. the non-market value of local farmers, [agricultural landscapes](http<colon>//erae.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/351.short), and [biodiversity](http<colon>//books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RdH6DRZY0KIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=economic+value+biodiversity&ots=7ghoqmISLQ&sig=TeotTfQYy2FYHha_R3XthhQaPCk&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=economic<percent>20value<percent>20biodiversity&f=false).) [Starr et al.](http<colon>//link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A<colon>1026169122326) present some non-market issues, as well as issues like quality and non-good services, that creates value from locally sourced produce. These more moral/value-judgement issues, as well as quality, hygiene, and supply-chain control issues all play a role in determining the economic value of local sourcing.<br><br>There are other approaches to the question. [Porter<sq>s work on <sq>location clusters<sq>](http<colon>//www.development.wne.uw.edu.pl/uploads/Courses/ied_porter_2000.pdf) is an interesting way of looking at the relative value of location-specificity when talking about competitive advantage. Issues of sustainability, both environmentally and in terms of the supply- and value-chain are relevant (sourcing produce from politically unstable countries to the extent that local producers falter could result in untenable food security issues). Further, issues of competitive advantage, as well as sustainability/biodiversity/quality issues, will likely vary from product to product. In addition, consumer demand for produce that simply *cannot* be locally produced remains relevant.<br><br>In short, buying local produce does not necessarily help or hinder the local economy. Determining what effect it has depends on a variety of considerations, most notably the classic one of comparative advantage.

                "answer": "<p><dq>Help<dq> is a somewhat vague term in this question. Who is it helping? Do you mean that it<sq>s helping the farmers/farming industry within the local economy? Do you mean does it do anything for the economy as a whole? <br><br>Let me offer this perspective to help you think about it. It<sq>s all about perspective<colon><br><br>Consider the local produce movement/farmer<sq>s markets. <br><br>1) Say for instance that the local produce comes from farms that are just outside of the suburbs of the city in which you live (that are considered part of your local economy... A Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) for instance). When you buy from them, money is exchanged from your hand to theirs within the local economy. In this regard, when analyzing the effects of this transaction on the economy of the MSA, new money is not brought into the system; it has simply changed hands, so it really does nothing special for that particular economy in terms of creating wealth. We could get into details about money crossing between industries but that<sq>s not particularly relevant.<br><br>2) Now, let<sq>s say that the local produce movement includes produce that crosses state borders. If the produce that you purchase comes from a farmer located in another MSA, you could say that the money has left your MSA, and has been added to the farmers MSA, which is new money within the farmer<sq>s local economy (MSA). On the same token, that money has left your MSA, as in, that money is no longer money that can be spent on other goods within your MSA... unless of course that farmer turns around and uses the money you just paid to him to buy something else while he<sq>s in town.<br><br>This same logic applies when you scale up your economic perspective. <br><br>Example 1 = buying produce <dq>in-country.<dq> Money is simply changing hands within the <dq>local economy,<dq> between industries. New money (demand) is not injected into local economy.<br><br>Example 2 = importing produce from other countries, in which case, the other country benefits from the new dollars (creating new demand) entering into their economy from outside of their economy, and some money has left your economy. <br><br>When it comes down to the numbers in the local economy though, it doesn<sq>t do much, unless the farmer has no one else to whom they can sell their produce, and lets it go to waste.<br><br>**With all of that said<colon>** In the US, most agriculture suppliers (commercial farms) are MASSIVE. These farm corporations are the corporations that provide produce to McDonald<sq>s and other major food corporations. They make up a significant share of the agriculture market. The local produce movement doesn<sq>t really affect them one way or another. Really the only part of the economy where local produce might benefit is the smallest farms (a few acres up to maybe a dozen acres) and local restaurants. If those farms can enter into contracts with local restaurants, the local economy is supporting product diversity - read<colon> [alternative markets](http<colon>//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080449104008890) - in the form of unique farm-to-table restaurants, the small farms themselves, and a truly local food experience, which is certainly a type of <dq>product<dq> that can benefit the economy via diversity and consumer choice. In that sense, local foods is definitely beneficial to the local economy because it supports competition in the restaurant industry and the small-agriculture industry. One now has the choice to eat at McD<sq>s or a local farm-to-table restaurant, versus having to choose between Wendy<sq>s, McD<sq>s, or another food chain.<br><br>Chapter<sq>s 5 and 6 might be of interest to you in *[Bringing the Food Economy Home<colon> Local Alternative to Agribusiness](http<colon>//books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=d0Z39xLdlHYC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=local+food+and+the+economy&ots=ulLJUzi0Ia&sig=UjdjzVQndeasiCY_BQcOTBPSAf0#v=onepage&q&f=false)*<br><br>EDIT<colon> The other answers from u/wbmccl and u/Gotekta did a great job with some more detailed insights as well. </p>",

One point he made (which I do agree with) was that Neoclassical economics *assumes* full employment (anyone in the Neoclassical world who isn<sq>t working simply prefers leisure at current wages), while in real life we need Keynesian policies to ensure the overall demand that creates full employment. But, he continued, once we do have full employment then we can analyze the economy with Neoclassical theory.

The extent to which this valuation is sustained through advertising and marketing versus some inherent aspect of the human condition is debatable. The consumer diamond industry is far more successful at limiting the supply through control of aspects of production up the line from mining. The famous Debeers monopoly has been essentially broken in the last few decades from a mining supply standpoint. However, I would argue the conspiracy theory actually evolved from the truly massive amount of marketing spending that has been invested by relatively few companies to ingrain the value / price of consumer diamonds in our culture. </p>",

The majority of American Jews may be secular, but they are still deeply affected by the current of 19th- early 20th century *racial anti-semitism* that culminated in the genocide of the Nazis.  While *Zionism* was an understandable response to such a reality, it is now an anachronism - and worse yet, a source for a whole new brand of anti-semitism (this time in the Muslim world, painted along religious rather than racial lines.)<br><br>- More decisively, the *Christian-Zionist* lobby in the USA.  While there certainly are religious Jewish supporters for Israel (some being quite fanatical, and difficult to distinguish from the most triumphalistic Islamists), they are numerically quite few.  The real religious support for Israel comes from those Protestants (mainly in the USA) who hold to eschatological views that center around the <dq>land of Israel<dq>.  Given their express political orientation, they really do bear a similarity to other wiley theocrats.  Because of  their social conservatism, they are part of the Republican base (unlike secular American Jewry, who generally vote Democrat.)<br><br>**COLD WAR**<br><br>- Israel was one part of an uneasy family of M.Eastern states that the USA made to secure resources (basically, petroleum) and territory from the influence of the USSR/Warsaw-Pact.  To do this a whole gaggle of disparate (and often mutually acrimonious) characters were assembled - theocrats, dictatorships...and Israel.  Much of the momentum of this period survives to the present day (even lacking an <dq>evil empire<dq> to justify the expense.)<br><br>**PRESENT**<br><br>- As the relationships between America and its <dq>other M.Eastern partners<dq> have fallen apart (most spectacularly in Iraq), Israel presented itself as America<sq>s most secure foothold in the region.  While the arguments in favor of that opinion are poor, it held a lot of political currency when wedded to the above mentioned factors (and the <dq>political momentum<dq> thereof.)<br><br>- Taking Christian-Zionists for a ride, **neo-conservatives** both in and out of government regard Israel as sufficiently similar (culturally and economically) to merit a special alliance, as a means of continuing American influence in the M.East.  How much this is based truly in the economic positions of the neo-cons (and not simple cultural chauvinism) is debatable.<br><br>**Note<colon>** Like many of America<sq>s questionable alliances (if ethics or consistency can be said to have really mattered in such things), on a practical level these <dq>friendships<dq> have been fueled by *foreign aid* (the bulk of which being not-so-subtle subsidies for America<sq>s arms industry - the kind of **welfare spending**  harsh reactionaries never seem to have an issue with.)<br><br>**TL;DR** Lots of reasons, none of them particularly in the interests of the average (non-psychotic) American.</p>",

I assume we wouldn<sq>t tell people who are being abused that they could choose to react to the abuse differently, that they are responsible for their feelings of fear or anger -- or would we?<br><br>I think the line <dq>taking responsibility for your own feelings<dq> is a little misleading when taken out of the context of therapy. What it refers to is the [A-B-C model](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy) (activating event-belief-consequence) developed by Ellis, which essentially just points out that the resulting thought patterns or behavioral states aren<sq>t strictly determined by the external event. Instead there<sq>s a mediating factor - you. <br><br>Taking <dq>responsibility<dq> in this sense just means that you aren<sq>t powerless to the harmful thought patterns that are interfering with your life, and even though you can<sq>t change the world around you, you<sq>re still able to change how you perceive and process those events. <br><br>What this means is that <dq>responsibility<dq> should not be interpreted in the *causal* sense. That is, if someone suffers emotional abuse at the hands of a parent, they aren<sq>t causally responsible for the sad feelings they<sq>re experiencing. They are simply <dq>responsible<dq> in the sense that they are capable of making changes that affect how it impacts them. <br><br>>Basically, when does an individual or a group get to demand that someone else change their behavior to make them more comfortable, especially in a situation where you can<sq>t really escape your perceived <dq>abuser,<dq> like in schools or society in general? Is there such a thing as an objective standard for determining what constitutes offense, and is offense distinguishable from harm?<br><br>I think you have to be clear what you<sq>re talking about here because you started talking about safe spaces and microaggressions, and now you<sq>re talking about offence. To be clear, you understand that the problems with those things aren<sq>t that they <dq>offend<dq> students, right? <br><br>Things like microaggressions and being triggered are things which have real measurable harms, not only on the individual but potentially even on the community or society as a whole. Microaggressions, despite the name, are really just a form of racial abuse, so I hope that it<sq>s clear that if someone is subject to racial abuse then their problem isn<sq>t that they<sq>re <dq>offended<dq>. There<sq>s real psychological harm that is occurring there. <br><br>The confusion you might be having with the basic philosophy behind CBT and how largescale changes might not be consistent with that is because CBT is an individual therapy. The point of it is simply to help the individual regardless of whether their situation can change. However, psychologists are also interested in making the world a better place, so they<sq>ll work towards making changes that promote mental well-being or reduce someone<sq>s chance of negative mental health outcomes. <br><br>If we didn<sq>t accept this, then your argument would essentially force us to say that instead of teaching parents that verbally abusing your child is wrong, we should instead just teach child how to cope and manage with that verbal abuse. Of course this is wrong. What we do is we help the people who<sq>ve already experienced it on an individual level (by treating them with things like CBT and helping them process what they<sq>ve experienced) and then we address the problem on a societal level, and figure out how to stop parents abusing their kids. <br><br>Think of CBT like a cast and societal changes in universities and elsewhere like stopping someone breaking their arm. Both are needed.<br><br>>I really don<sq>t know what to do with the claims of young people who, it seems to me, DO have legitimate beefs around racism, sexism, etc., but ALSO seem to be quite fragile and prone to distorted thinking.<br><br>I don<sq>t understand how you<sq>re concluding that they<sq>re <dq>fragile<dq>? Or <dq>prone to distorted thinking<dq>? Things like microaggressions are real harms, not overreactions (there<sq>s a decent overview [here](http<colon>//library.standrews-de.org/lists/courseguides/sas-specific_topic-research/diversity-readings/microaggressions_black.pdf)), and psychological organisations generally agree with the [use of trigger warnings in classrooms](http<colon>//www.apa.org/monitor/2014/07-08/course-distress.aspx). <br><br>When we have warnings on chocolate bars because they contain <dq>nuts<dq>, are we supposing that people with allergies are <dq>fragile<dq>? Or when we install access ramps in public places are we assuming people in wheelchairs are <dq>fragile<dq>? Of course not, people just have different needs - some are physical and some are psychological. When it comes to wanting a university free from racial abuse, then that just sort of seems like a standard thing all people interested in mental health would agree with. </p>",

This type of thing is very common in Arab media, and is a commonly pushed line. While selectively publishing these types of things (obviously looking for examples), MEMRI publishes a whole lot of translated videos and information in Arab media that pushes discriminatory or news-worthy statements. For example, [there was recently a video](http<colon>//www.memri.org/clip/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4962.htm) accusing Israel of flooding the Arab worlds with <dq>drugs<dq> and corrupting influences like <dq>penis enlargement ads<dq>. Looking through their [clips](http<colon>//www.memri.org/) reveals common debates on Israel and Jews that frequently move into anti-Semitic territory.

I can say that many historians have been debunking the myth of the <dq>golden age<dq> of relations persisting until Israel<sq>s establishment between Jews and Muslims. While Jews were treated <dq>better<dq> in the Arab world than in Europe, there was still fast-rising anti-Semitism. Bernard Lewis wrote extensively on it, and on how pre-Zionism there was still rising anti-Semitism as the level of unhappiness rose in the failing Ottoman Empire. As an aside, we also know that Nazi propaganda was broadcast throughout the Middle East, and that the propaganda appears to have left a lasting imprint on the German population that heard it, so it may have done so for the Arab population even if to a lesser extent (they did not respond to it the same way with attempts to kill Jews, mostly).<br><br>Hope that helps, I<sq>m happy to provide more information if you<sq>d like.

Secularization theory is a very large and complex body of work that has been unable to account for empirical findings for quite some time. For instance, the young Peter Berger hypothesised that increased religious pluralism would lead to the abandonment of religion because pluralism relativises truth - i.e., the explanations offered by any one religious community are challenged by those offered by others. This makes religion altogether implausible, argues Berger, and secularisation in the form of decline of religious belief and activity will follow.<br><br>This has been challenged by many, but IMO most interestingly by Kaufman et.al. who point out that the main source of pluralisation in Europe today (Europe being the bastion of secularism) is immigration. Immigrants tend to have strong religious commitments, traditionalist values which facilitate a high degree of cultural reproduction (socialisation of children into said tradition) and - most importantly - have a fertility rate that far supercedes that of secular heritage Europeans. Thus secularisation in Europe, understood as the overall decline in religious belief, is likely to become reversed in the near future due to the demographic developments following increased immigration from non-Western countries.<br><br>As chicagofirefifa points out, the changes reported among heritage westerners can also be explained by a weakening of the social bonds that used to tie an individual or family to one particular church. Individualisation leads for many to increased selectivity, also in the religious marketplace. <br><br>As a methodological sidenote, the question used by the GSS strikes me as odd.

                "answer": "<p>Before my answer, let me just make you aware of the difference between <dq>stocks<dq> and <dq>flows.<dq> A stock is just an accumulation of some thing (in this case government debt), while a flow is the rate of change at which the stock of that thing increases or decreases.<br><br>There<sq>s no evidence that there is anything special about any given level of debt. Neither levels of 0 debt or debt/gdp = 1, or any other level of the stock of debt, have been shown to bring any great benefits or significant drawbacks on their own. There is no reason to target any specific level for the stock of debt. That<sq>s key. Most people focus in on the stock, simply because it<sq>s a big number. People just don<sq>t naturally understand big numbers. With debt, focus on the flow.<br><br>Countries whose debt grows (the <dq>flow<dq> of debt) slower than their overall economy are in a fully sustainable position. The problem with having a large stock of debt is that you have to pay to service it. Servicing debt means that you have to pay interest on the debt and manage <dq>rolling the debt over<dq> to new sets of people when the original people who lent money want to cash out. As long as overall economic growth is increasing faster than debt, the cost of having a stock of debt will be decreasing. <br><br>Almost every economist would agree that should regular growth return, decreasing deficits to where they<sq>re safely less than overall growth would be sufficiently healthy. <br><br>Those are the basic outlines of government debt. The nuts and bolts get more complicated. For instance, government debt securities in the US are considered <dq>risk-free<dq> (meaning the market believes there<sq>s no chance the individuals who invest in them won<sq>t be paid back). Since they are risk-free and holding them entitles you to interest payments, they<sq>re like holding cash, but better. The interest protects you from your holdings decreasing in value due to inflation. Because of this, a lot of financial firms use US government debt securities effectively as money. The supply of money is obviously a very important factor in a market. So any attempt to pay off the debt and drastically reduce US government debt securities would have uncertain financial effects. This all still requires a lot of study.<br><br>As of now, no, paying off the national debt (reducing the stock) would not be a worthy goal. Getting back to a position where economic growth is outpacing the deficit and therefore reducing the costs of debt service is a worthy goal.<br><br>Edit<colon> http<colon>//www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/guest-post-reinhartrogoff-and-growth-time-debt<br><br>Up until recently, there was some supposition about whether or not a debt/gdp ratio of 90<percent> was a potential <dq>tipping point<dq> for a country<sq>s growth. Once a government<sq>s debt exceeded that level, it was supposed to reduce growth. Kenneth Rogoff and Carment Reinhart, both from Harvard, were the biggest proponents of this hypothesis. The post above from Arindrajit Dube, based on work done by Herndon, Ash, and Pollin, describes how focusing on debt levels as a causal mechanism gets things backwards. High debt levels are a result of poor growth, rather than the other way around. The evidence indicates that debt levels don<sq>t reliably cause anything, so targeting any specific level isn<sq>t worthwhile.</p>",

Are there factual (as opposed to political or theoretical) challenges to Graeber<sq>s data and conclusions?  How well accepted is the book by academics?<br><br>Second, and more on topic to this question<colon> One of the things Mr. Graeber discusses is a cycle of governments (and their armies) collecting taxes (in the form of specie) and paying soldiers in the same.  This provides a force to have a flow of money.  Local workers have to provide material support to the soldiers (food, cloth, weapons) in order to get the gold that they have to give up to the government. Governments invent the marketplace through force of arms to support armies of force.  Mr. Graeber does not believe markets and money arise out of a need to eliminate barter.<br><br>Yet over and over (he claims) some organization ends up stockpiling specie (the government? the church? wealthy landowners or merchants? different times different places).  By draining the marketplace of the only money available, people turn to debt instruments to conduct business.  (Or they revolt, storm the churches, melt all the gold icons, and form a new government that pays solders in gold, and collects taxes in the same.)<br><br>Finally, a question<colon> Is the stockpiling of debt in the US at all similar to this process, or is it the exact opposite?  With so much debt, where is the actual value stored?  Is it concentrated somewhere, which could be <sq>stormed during revolution<sq> to start a new cycle of market building?<br><br>Or am I crazy and deluded to think this theory of Graeber has anything to do with modern US Treasury debt.</p>",

The solution then would be to subsidise education to the point that you get efficient consumption, or alternatively, to heavily subsidise student loans.

Until Theodore Rooselvelt (unsucccessfully) attempted a third term in the early twentieth century, everyone had respected and followed the rule, which was thought to be essential to the avoidance of the type of tyrrany inherent in monarchies and other non-democratic systems of governance. After Franklin D. Roosevelt successfully retained the position of US President for thirteen years, and in the aftermath of defeating a set of tyrannical dictatorships, it was deemed necessary to formaly codify the two-term limit rule. There are some historians who argue that the in-office illnesses suffered by both Franklin Roosevelt and earlier by Woodrow Wilson also played a significant role in the adoption of the 22nd Amendment, as there was significant concern that the President<sq>s power could be (and had been, in the case of Wilson) coopted by another person when the president became disabled. The 22nd Amendment would preclude the continued cooptation of presidential powers through the legal time limitations on that president<sq>s power.

                "answer": "<p>In abstract terms, economic growth is not unsustainable (population growth probably is)\u2014of course, this will depend on what we define as economic growth. <br><br>A more direct question would necessarily revolve around the nature of capitalism. Can the logic of capital accumulation provide the basis for a sustainable world? As we have seen throughout modern history, capital seeks out new markets, transforming previously unmarketable goods into commodities. This includes many things, from health services, to ideas, to water, to complex financial instruments. In other words, there is an expansion of <sq>places<sq> (markets) in which commodities can be bought and sold, places where <sq>things<sq> are transformed into commodities that can be privately and exclusively owned, either by individuals or fictitious individuals, such as the corporation. In this process, capital (as a set of social relations) seeks to <sq>privatize<sq> or commoditize everything and anything so as to produce more capital. There are setbacks to be sure\u2014the welfare state is a good example\u2014based on political and economic conditions, the balance of class power, and other factors, but on the whole the trajectory is toward more and more capital accumulation, and thus, greater centralization of capital in what we now call transnational corporations.<br><br>Given the general nature of this logic, the trajectory is toward a fairly dystopian world where everything (and I mean everything) is bought and sold, subject to market forces. This is, of course, a hypothetical situation in which contingency plays no part\u2014and as we know, historical events are nothing if not incredibly contingent, and in some cases, contradictory to our understanding of development. <br><br>By itself, the nature and logic of capital accumulation seems unsustainable in the long run without destroying the planet and pushing the majority of the world<sq>s subordinate classes into further poverty, with less control of their political economic futures. Of course, that in itself is unsustainable, and thus, as we move from crisis to crisis we see different popular reactions and counter-movements (e.g., the Quebec student strike, Occupy, etc.). So while capital accumulation is likely unsustainable, I do not think it is impossible to have a world in which <sq>economic growth<sq> is sustainable, but this would need to be an economic growth based not merely on profit for individuals\u2014fictitious or otherwise\u2014but rather, those who create social wealth in the first place.<br><br>That is my personal view on the matter, but in answer to your question of why governments are obsessed with <sq>growth<sq> you could take a number of different approaches. Using a Foucauldian lens, you might ask where our fascination for <sq>growth<sq> came from, examining texts and archives, etc., to determine the genealogy of the concept (more so, in the sense of what Foucault might call a particular governmentality of growth).<br><br>You could also take a Marxian-influenced perspective that examines the role of the state. The state (and government) cannot be viewed as independent actors. They are explicitly tied to the economic system, and, as such, are themselves a relation of production that makes possible the appearance of a separation between the political and economic system. Therefore, you might want to examine the particular <sq>economic<sq>\u2014not to be taken as a separate entity\u2014conditions that has framed the nature of <sq>growth<sq> in particular eras. Are they different? Why or why not? Is it merely a case of what I outline above, based on the nature of capital accumulation? Or, are there other factors that have influenced the nature of growth, its trajectory and development? What about political ideologies such as neoliberalism which takes a somewhat different approach to growth than the policies of the Keynesian Welfare State?<br><br>That<sq>s just a start, but hopefully it helps.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>There<sq>s a few ways to look at this. Let<sq>s start with the more benign cases. <br><br>The quote you gave describes <dq>sexual assault<dq>. Sexual assault can have a very broad definition, from getting ones ass grabbed on the street to getting beaten and bit during foreplay to (according to some authors) penetrative rape. So during the course of flirting it doesn<sq>t seem crazy to me for more mild sexual assaults (kissing somebody while they sleep) to happen but for both parties to just get over it. I didn<sq>t read the Ellis, Widmayer, and Palmer study, it would be worth double-checking the definition they used. Could you get in a fist fight with somebody and then stay friends? <br><br>Now let<sq>s go to the less benign cases.<br><br>>Sexual violence may occur in any type of relationship, but most perpetrators of sexual assault are known to their victims. Among victims ages 18 to 29, two-thirds had a prior relationship with the offender. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports that 6 in 10 rape or sexual assault victims said that they were assaulted by an intimate partner, relative, friend or acquaintance. A study of sexual victimization of college women showed that 9 out of 10 victims knew the person who sexually victimized them<br><br>[source](http<colon>//www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/pages/victims-perpetrators.aspx)<br><br>It<sq>s not likely that these victims are jumped in an alley and then start writing the attacker in prison. Mostly they had some type of pre-existing relationship. Roughly half of victims who experience something which meets the legal definition of rape agree that it was rape [Sexual Victimization of College Women, page 22](http<colon>//www.atria.nl/epublications/2000/Sexual_Victimization_of_College_Women.pdf). If they decide not to report it to the cops and the person stays out, cutting ties with them probably means cutting many of their social connections. It<sq>s easier to just try and rationalize the experience.<br></p>",

I<sq>m writing the first part last and what follows is a general overview on the investment landscape and who does which jobs. I tried to source when I could but I also included a fair bit of opinion, which is from my experience working in prop trading and in pursuing a doctorate in mathematical finance.<br><br>Generally hedge funds fall under the category of equity speculators, parties that trade stocks with a view to make bets on specific companies they think are valued incorrectly. This is a valuable service for a few reasons<colon><br><br>- [Activist investment](http<colon>//www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activist-investor.asp), which is when a fund purchases a large stake in a company and uses its shareholder vote to make changes at an organizational level, is a pursuit limited to big money players. Starting a hedge fund can create an entity capable of activist investing.<br>- Price discovery is when the market price of an asset gets determined by the balance of buyers and sellers. I couldn<sq>t find a great primer on it so here<sq>s [wikipedia](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discovery). Price discovery only occurs properly when there are agents out there who will buy at one price but not at a higher one. Agents who will buy at any price or sell for any price do not contribute to price discovery. <br>- [The big short](http<colon>//www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/), or just [short selling](http<colon>//www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) in general, is not something your average investor can get in to. Yes, there are short ETFs and some mutual funds use shorting, but the specific targeting shorting of a company accused of being overvalued is extremely risky and mostly limited to individual traders and hedge funds. A great example is Citron research, which researches crappy companies, shorts them, and then publishes the dirt. If you want to see what happens without short sellers look no further than China. See for example Chang, Cheng, Yu <sq>07 for some discussion on what happens when you don<sq>t allow short sellers. Hint, it starts with <sq>b<sq> and ends with <sq>ubble<sq>.<br>- Risk transfer. Keynes <sq>30 put it best when he said that futures markets exist to transfer risk. Hedge funds involved with commodities speculation have plenty of capital and no overhead, so they trade futures against commodity producers who risk things like going out of business or defaulting on debt if the market moves against them.<br>- [Market making](http<colon>//www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) is when a trader or fund is willing to either buy or sell a security for prices that are reasonably close, say buying Apple at 98 or selling at 99. This is more prop trading than hedge fund territory but that isn<sq>t a huge deal. It occurs on lit markets in the form of a [spread](http<colon>//www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-and-asked.asp) and it also occurs over the phone for very large orders that will probably move the market price by some amount. This is good for a few reasons. One, it lets people come in and trade instantly instead of waiting. Two, it makes people more confident that they got a fair price, since they knew they could have just as easily bought or sold at essentially the same price.<br><br>So those are the services hedge funds provide. The reason we need hedge funds to provide those services is because most of us don<sq>t do shit all for research when we invest. The most common type of equity investing is in [index funds](http<colon>//www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp). You can buy these from virtually every mutual fund provider and also on the market in the form of ETFs. When you buy an index fund you<sq>re essentially instructing an intermediary to purchase a basket of stocks according to the fund<sq>s investment mandate. The most popular index funds track the S&P 500, so when you buy these you<sq>re buying a predetermined number of shares in the US<sq> biggest 500 companies.<br><br>[This article](http<colon>//money.cnn.com/2015/03/31/investing/investing-index-funds-warning/) isn<sq>t a great academic source but it outlines the basic problem with this approach. All of those investment dollars, which currently own a whopping 20<percent> of the 500 companies involved in the index, are totally uninformed. They aren<sq>t price sensitive, they won<sq>t sell one out of those 500 companies if they think it<sq>s overpriced and they won<sq>t buy more shares of number 400 if they think it<sq>s undervalued. The article I linked also points to the issue of corporate governance. Owners of shares get to vote on who sits on a [company<sq>s board](http<colon>//www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp), and those people are responsible for things like hiring and firing CEOs. Index fund owners have a stake in 500 companies, you can<sq>t expect them to make well-researched shareholder voting decisions for all of them. Index fund providers are currently doing that job but they have no financial incentive to do it well.<br><br>Now enter the actively managed fund. Many of these funds are glorified index funds that use some sort of proprietary method for allocating money to stocks. These are the mutual funds you can purchase from your bank that claim to have financial experts picking stocks to buy. Academia has found that these types of funds are fairly average, see for example Gruber <sq>96, but that some highly specialized mutual funds have been able to provide above average returns, see for example Kacperczyk, Sialm, Zheng <sq>05. The takeaway, at least in my opinion, is that programmatic or broad investment mandates typically deliver similar or worse performance than index funds, while specialized trading in small asset classes is able to achieve what traders call alpha - an advantage over the rest of the market due to smart investing.<br><br>Hedge funds are the next step in active investment. While mutual funds charge management fees as a fixed portion of assets, hedge funds charge those fees and take a portion of the profits they make. This allows them to spend a lot more time and money on research, provided they<sq>re able to leverage it in to buying underpriced companies and short selling overpriced ones. Hedge funds take very large, sometimes controlling, positions in smaller companies. Sometimes they get it right, like when Greenlight Capital sold short an overpriced Keurig. Sometimes they get it wrong, like how Pershing Square just took a massive billion dollar loss on Valeant. Hedge fund managers that get things right tend to stay in business and are permitted to trade with more capital. Those who get it wrong eventually exit the industry. Overall academia tends to lean towards thinking that hedge funds are an okay investment, but not substantially better than the index, see for example Ackermann, McEnally <sq>99. In financial theory this might imply that there are too many hedge funds, that they charge fees that are too high, or that some other mechanism is keeping prices fair and taking away good trade opportunities.<br></p>",

My response addresses an important change in the way people worked that took place during the Industrial Revolution. However it seems to follow from this theory that the changes in the organization of work influenced the attitudes towards work you mention and not the other way around. Therefore, this approach is materialistic.<br><br>Firs of all we must have a more nuanced understanding of Aristotle<sq>s <dq>disdain for work<dq>.<br><br><br>Quoting from Polanyi<sq>s <dq>Societies and Economic Systems<dq> in *The Great Transformation*, pp.56-57<colon><br>> Airstotle distinguishes on production for use against production for gain as the essence of householding [\u0153conomia] proper [...] In denouncing the principle of production for gain as boundless and limitless, <dq>as not natural to man<dq>, Aristotle was, in effect, aiming at the crucial point , namely, the divorce of  the economic motive from all concrete  social relationships which  would by their very nature set a limit to that motive.<br><br>As we can see, Aristotle didn<sq>t criticize all work, but rather excessive work. The creation of a system which sets no upper limit for work was the main change in this regard.<br><br>Polanyi goes on to say, in <dq>The Self Regulating Market and the Fictitous Commodities<dq>, *The Great Transformation*, pp. 78-79<colon><br>> But the more complicated industrial production became, the more numerous were the elements of industry the supply of which had to be safeguarded [...] In a commercial society their supply could be organized in one way only<colon> by being made available for purchase [...] therefore labor, land and money had to be transformed into commodities in order to keep production going. [...] All along the line, human society had become an accessory of the economic system.<br><br>The organization of work had to undergo a change to satisfy the demands of non-stop industrial production. It had to be put on sale (wage labor). This meant the distribution and quantity of labor (where and how much people work) would answer only to the needs of industrial production. This form of socioeconomic organization **does not** set an upper limit for work, unlike the \u0153ikos, for instance.<br><br>Without this upper limit, the time dedicated to work went up. More importantly, it became the social center of human activity.<br><br>You could say work became <dq>good<dq> when it became <dq>a good<dq> (commodity).<br><br>Note<colon> I omitted why industrial ~~labor~~ production requires this kind of non-stop activity.
