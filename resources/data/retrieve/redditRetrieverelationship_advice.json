(We<sq>ll get to 999 ways to please your new partner next week - <dq>Draw her a bath, touch her on the clit. Make her favorite breakfast, touch her on the clit.<dq>)<br><br>1.) You<sq>re going to talk to the baddest meanest fucking lawyer you can possibly find (Afford). Be very thorough about what you expect and what he<sq>s going to expect from you. Ask for referrals. You tell him very plainly, <dq>Handle it. Get me what<sq>s mine. I<sq>m not in it to ruin her, because frankly she<sq>s not worth our fucking time.<dq> You<sq>ve got a life to go live. <br><br>2.) Take a look over on /r/divorce. All kinds of great information on the steps you need to be taking now. You better believe she is doing the same. Address credit cards, bills, bank accounts etc. RIGHT NOW. It can all become a nightmare if you don<sq>t address that shit ASAP. Her world is about to get shattered into all kinds of pieces. She will panic the second she realizes her happy comfortable life is about to get very UNcomfortable. Panic-y people are impulsive,  scary creatures. General consensus seems to be that she is lacking in the maturity department. Expect her to handle the divorce with no more maturity than what she brought to her relationship with you. <br><br>3.) Address your mutual relationships, inlaws, friends, etc. It will be tough but don<sq>t go into a tirade of details of why you are splitting up. People will want to take sides. Refrain from this, and instead take the high road. <dq>Unfortunately Mrs. Throwaway142012<sq>s has made it painfully clear she wasn<sq>t ready to honor the commitment she made. Despite all of this, it meant a lot to me to have you guys in my life. I wish you guys nothing but the best.<dq><br><br>4.) No alcohol for a while. Especially while you are still living together. During times like this it is way to easy for a casual night out for a few beers to get ugly real quick when you get home. If you do end up going out to drink with friends. Give them your cell phone. Crash at their place for the night. Any further interaction you have with your soon to be ex-wife needs to involve BOTH of you being 100<percent> sober. She comes home drunk and doesn<sq>t go straight to bed? You GET THE FUCK OUT NOW. She drunk dials/e-mails/texts you? You save that shit until the divorce is final. If you can sublease the house, get your own place, or crash with a generous friend in the meantime? DO IT. <br><br>**NOW THE FUN STARTS**<br><br>5.) Wake up in the morning, go to the bathroom and fill your sink with ice cold water. Dunk your head in that shit and hold it for 3-5 seconds. Congratulations on your baptism! From this day forward, you are a born again BAAAAAD MOTHERFUCKER! Look yourself in the mirror and with your best Samuel L. Jackson impression, you say it. <dq>I AM A BAAAAAD MUTHAFUCKA!<dq> <br><br>6.) You are going to start a conversation with a MINIMUM of 5 girls today. Strangers. Cashiers. If you make em<sq> smile, you win that round. You don<sq>t care if your ever see them ever again. For all you know, they<sq>re at home later that night, knuckle deep, thinking about that guy that charmed the shit out of them that morning. <br><br>7.) Go to work. If you<sq>re one of the few doing what you love, all the better. Even if you<sq>re not, you know what feels real good? Success. It<sq>s easy to get complacent in a job and skate by. But that<sq>s not you. Not anymore. No, no, no. This BMF takes obstacles and blows them smitherfuckineens. After the dust settles, you should have CERN calling you to borrow your cock because the Super-Collider broke again.<br><br>8.) Remember that thing you<sq>ve always wanted to try? Go do it. Was it fun? Did you meet new people? Go do it again. <br><br>9.) Make a sandwich. Being the BADDEST MOTHERFUCKER ON THE PLANET sure can work up an appetite.<br><br>10.) Ok. Last thing. This is most important thing you will do today and every day for the rest of your life. You ready? <br><br>**MAKE TODAY YOUR BITCH.** <br><br>Welcome to the rest of your life you lucky son of a bitch. </p>",

This was one of the first things we learned and something that we said to *every* survivor of domestic violence when we spoke with them. It<sq>s easy to give people the advice to leave, but the reality is that staying in an abusive relationship is chronically dangerous, but the most acute danger comes from trying to get out.<br><br>People who are with an abuser have no good or safe option to deal with it. It is unsafe to stay. It may be extremely unsafe to leave. <br><br>If you make a habit of giving relationship advice, online or otherwise, please make a point to learn the signs of an abusive relationship, including signs that are not physical violence. An emotional abuser can turn into a physically violent abuser in the blink of an eye. <br><br>Here are a few non-violent behaviors to pay attention to (read more from [Psychology Today](https<colon>//www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/200812/are-you-dating-abuser))<br><br>* **Blaming** - The potential abuser is never at fault for anything; they blame their partner, their parents, their children, their coworkers, but never themselves. When they do something to hurt their partner, they can make the partner feel it was *their own* fault. <br>* **Pushing for Early Commitment** - The potential abuser sweeps their new partner off their feet and pursues them aggressively, proclaiming the relationship <dq>meant to be<dq> and rushing into commitments like exclusivity, cohabitation, marriage, and parenting, without concern for whether the other person wants the same things<br>* **Superiority** - The potential abuser puts down their partner instead of building them up. Every conflict or petty argument is a chance to remind the partner they are less-than and could never do better than the potential abuser.<br>* **Gaslighting** - The potential abuser treats their partner<sq>s concerns or grievances as an opportunity to remind the partner that they are crazy, irrational, needy, or otherwise undeserving of a fair hearing from the potential abuser.<br>* **Resentment/Entitlement Double Hitter** - The world has been very unfair to the potential abuser, therefore they are entitled to take what they want from the world, because it hasn<sq>t given them what they deserved. They dwell on ways they<sq>ve been <dq>wronged<dq> in the past (even petty things like not making a high school sports team) and they use those wrongs as excuses for their own wrongdoing -- <dq>So what if I put a fake degree on my resume, I *would* have graduated from Harvard if it weren<sq>t for my math teacher hating me in high school and failing me just to ruin my college prospects.<dq> <br>* **Sexual Entitlement** - The potential abuser steps on the potential victim<sq>s consent in sexual situations. If they have a fetish, their partner is expected to fulfill it whether they want to or not. They may demand an <dq>open relationship<dq> in which the potential abuser gets to sleep around, but the potential victim is faithful. They may actively ignore a sexual <dq>no<dq> from their partner and later blame their behavior on a misunderstanding, being drunk, or being <dq>in the moment.<dq><br>* **Unilateral Decision Making**  - The potential abuser may control all the money in the relationship, control all the parenting decisions, decide on their own which home the family will live in, or take a job out of state without consulting the family. Their excuse for making family decisions unilaterally is that they are somehow better qualified - <dq>You know you<sq>re bad with money anyway, you were broke when I met you<dq> or <dq>I have a degree in child psychology, of course I<sq>m the one deciding what consequences the children get for misbehavior<dq> or <dq>I don<sq>t need you with me at the house showing to know what you<sq>d think of the house.<dq><br><br>The tricky thing here is that *everyone does some of these things some of the time*. Raise your hand if you<sq>ve never unfairly blamed your partner for something? Raise your hand if you<sq>re never reminded a partner of some small way you<sq>re superior to them--grades, IQ, salary? Not too many hands raised, right? No, that doesn<sq>t mean you are a latent abuser that<sq>s one bad breakup away from murdering children. <br><br>Dangerous people are often hard to differentiate from people who just aren<sq>t in the right relationship, especially from the outside of the relationship. Resentment and blame are common in any failing marriage. Feelings of superiority to a partner are expressed by a lot of people who are just kinda assholes, not potential murderers. <br><br>But, if you see several of these red flags, they are chronic rather than things that only appeared when the relationship started failing, and they are present to some degree even in lovey-dovey honeymoon phases of the relationship, *tread very carefully*.<br><br>If you believe you may be speaking to someone who is dating or married to a potential abuser, and you intend to advise them to leave, please take the time to also refer them to some of the resources they can use to assure their safety. Nobody has ever lost their life by being **too** careful about a breakup. <br>Jason had no way to know that his wife would escalate straight to child murder from emotional abuse. *Very very very few* people, even violent abusers, ever escalate to child murder. And a person as dangerous as this woman would likely have been able to overcome anything Jason or his family and friends did to keep him and the children safe--not to mention that with no history of violence, it would have been extremely hard to use any kind of legal force to keep the children away from their mother. In short, this tragedy was not preventable and nobody except the murderer is to blame for it.<br><br>However, there are preventable tragedies every day, and a lot of them happen when a victim leaves an abuser.<br><br>Please always keep this in mind whenever you hear someone talk about their relationship and you spot some red flags of a potential abuser, regardless of gender, regardless of if there<sq>s a history of violence, and regardless of the physical sizes and strengths of the people involved. <br><br>Be the person who says, <dq>This may sound crazy, but I think you need to be careful about your safety when you break up with your partner.<dq> Be the person who says, <dq>I just want you to know that if you need help making sure they can<sq>t find you, I<sq>m here and I won<sq>t make you feel like you<sq>re overreacting.<dq> Be the person who says, <dq>If anyone gives you a hard time about taking care of your safety this way, refer them to me and I<sq>ll get them to stop bothering you.<dq> Be the person who says, <dq>If you feel unsafe, it<sq>s okay to listen to that inner voice even if other people laugh at you.<dq> Be the person who says, <dq>Your safety is more important than anything else you could be doing with your life right now.<dq> Be the person who says, <dq>I will drive you to court to get the restraining order.<dq> Be the person who says <dq>I will take care of your cat while you<sq>re in the domestic violence shelter.<dq><br><br>Taking emotional abuse seriously saves lives. It<sq>s never <dq>just<dq> emotional abuse. It<sq>s abuse, period. Even if someone has never been violent, if they are comfortable with harming their partner through gaslighting, put-downs, insults, and walking roughshod all over their wants & needs, they are *comfortable hurting their partner*, which means they may be dangerous. <br><br>Don<sq>t say, <dq>Well, at least s/he doesn<sq>t hit you,<dq> or, <dq>It hasn<sq>t gotten physical, right?<dq><br><br>Say, <dq>Abuse is abuse and you don<sq>t deserve this.<dq> <br><br>Say, <dq>Leaving can be the most dangerous time in an abusive relationship. Let<sq>s sit down now and make your safety plan together.<dq><br><br>Those two sentences save lives.</p>",

I<sq>m incredibly disturbed by this.  <br><br>And I feel really angry.<br><br>I<sq>m a regular on this sub, and what I see almost every day on here is a mix. It<sq>s almost all well-meaning. Some people give solid support to people who are hurt and confused and in need. Some people, on the other hand, offer myopic and damaging advice based on their own dysfunctional patterns. <br><br>It<sq>s arrogant--no background, no training, no rigorous thought, and not enough information, yet still these bold pronouncements about exactly how the people who come here seeking help should live their lives. <br><br>Until now I<sq>ve basically made peace with it. I figured that I<sq>ll win some and lose some. I<sq>ll get to some threads early enough to not get buried, and be able to maybe encourage people to seek help or give them tactical advice about communication patterns, or whatever. And other threads I won<sq>t get to until there are already hundreds of replies chanting for blood or divorce, or whatever. <br><br>But man. This isn<sq>t just a <dq>someone got bad advice<dq> and now some college kids broke up who could have made it, or a sad wife just didn<sq>t get the insight she<sq>d need to heal yet. <br><br>Jason<sq>s children are dead, murdered. Tyler. Charlee. They were here, and they aren<sq>t anymore.<br><br>Maybe I would<sq>ve fucked it up too. But I<sq>ll tell you this<colon> I read that thread. And I had something to say, but I decided not to because there was already too much noise, my reply would have been buried. <br><br>It<sq>s not that I didn<sq>t think he should lawyer up and get out. <br><br>But if I **had** posted, what I would<sq>ve pointed out was that the pattern he described in his post wasn<sq>t the usual Borderline behavior we see so much of here, but was maybe full blown Antisocial Personality. <br><br>ASPD is no fucking joke, and if I _had_ written that post that I decided not to write, I would<sq>ve advised proceeding with _extreme_ caution. That if I was right about my ASPD guess, then his wife would likely lash out in surprisingly vicious ways when cornered, once she realized she<sq>d lost leverage. I would<sq>ve advised him to secure his belongings and his children just in case, before handing her the paperwork.   <br><br>But I didn<sq>t write that, I only thought it. <br><br>And I have a great deal of regret and guilt about that. I thought posting would be pointless, the mob had already spoken. Maybe I was wrong, maybe I was right. <br><br>I<sq>m not really sure what to do in future.<br><br>* **On a personal level**, should it by my policy to always post if I see dangerous advice? Can I commit to that kind of vigilance? Will it even make a difference, or am I just right that the reddit algorithm and the fate of timing mean that nothing I post after a certain critical mass will even be seen?<br>* **On a community level**, are we doing more harm than good? Is this mostly the blind leading the blind? Should we just shut down and use a style sheet to display a link to a therapist directory, a suicide hotline number, and a domestic abuse hotline number? Would that actually be better? <br><br>People in serious need **do not** need advice mediated by a mob-driven popularity contest. Sure, that popularity contest occasionally returns decent answers, based on the direction and speed of the wind at the moment it<sq>s posted. But that hardly matters in the face of a real loss, real tragedy. What people in serious need actually need is serious advice. From people who have some business offering it. <br><br>It<sq>s a serious issue that the reddit algorithm is optimized for pithy memes to rise to the top, and that we<sq>ve coopted that algorithm to offer life changing--**_life ending_**--advice. It<sq>s not meant for that. We thought it was <dq>close enough.<dq> Maybe it<sq>s not, maybe it never was. <br><br>I have some personal soul searching to do about participating here anymore--I feel like it<sq>s an implicit endorsement, some capitulation to a dangerous machine. But maybe it actually does do more good than harm. I have to decide what I believe for myself, and I<sq>ll do that in the coming days.<br><br>But as a community--and particularly the leaders, the mods, of this community, /u/buu700, /u/thebeefytaco, /u/Saydrah, /u/FuckMaine, /u/bigboehmboy, /u/slamare247, /u/r3m0t, /u/eganist, /u/Kurorei, /u/impotent_rage --we have to figure out how to do better. How to get the right sort of reply to the top of threads, instead of buried in dreck. I don<sq>t know precisely what can be done, but I know we can improve it. <br><br>Maybe it<sq>ll require some software changes, but you know what? It seems like 2 innocent children dying is enough of a story to get on the fucking phone with one of the reddit developers and figure something out. <br><br>I<sq>m so, so sorry, Jason. I<sq>m powerless to really help or comfort you here from this text box on the internet, but at least I can tell you that I<sq>m out here in the world wishing with all my might that I could. And hoping that something other than senseless misery can come out of this. My thoughts are with you, and I expect them to be for a very long time.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m not sure if it<sq>s considered advice, but I will share this. <br><br>Many moons ago I was very young and pregnant with my first child. I was not ready for a baby, and was strongly considering all of my options. My boyfriend at the time (lovingly) talked me into keeping it, saying such things as <dq>we love each other so much, we can do this<dq>, etc. he used a lot of the word <dq>together<dq>, if I remember correctly. Around 5 months into the pregnancy, his new gf confronted me, similar to your situation. There was no marriage or anything, but obviously he was committed elsewhere. When confronted, he acted like the loser he was, blaming me, blah blah blah. It was a nightmare for me, and anyone around me at the time that cared for me. The complete lack of respect and decency in a situation like this was appalling. <br><br>Fast forward 13 years. I have been committed to being the best mother-person that I could ever be. I never knew I would like it, until I tried. Now I honestly don<sq>t know what I<sq>d do without knowing myself that way, if that makes sense. I<sq>ve learned so much about life, people, relationships, I could go on and on. I am okay. In fact, I am more than okay. I have been through emotional disaster and I have risen above. Her father has been in her life this whole time, pays child support, and now is a completely wonderful father to her. In fact, I couldn<sq>t ask for a better one, he seems to have grown up too. <br><br>Because that happens. Everything is always evolving, we may not be able to see it in the darkest of hours, but even a situation like this will look different through the lens of hindsight. The only true healer is time. And as the time passes, slowly and grueling at first, allow yourself to feel. Aloe yourself to be angry and sad. Know that you never really will know what is going to happen. Trust in yourself. Rebuild the relationship that you have with your own heart, it<sq>s been shattered, but it can be transformed into something much greater than it was. It<sq>s a powerful thing to experience such destruction and come out with compassion and humility. <br><br>So rise above. Be your own champion, be your children<sq>s hero. When they are much older, believe me, they will begin to understand that all parents are flawed, some more deeply than others. The truth always prevails in the end, trust in that during these hard times. I know this when I say it, you will be okay. <br><br>Finally, I feel for you. My heart goes out, as I was somewhere similar, so long ago. But it doesn<sq>t last forever. And for what it<sq>s worth, I still sink into the bath that way. Sometimes to remember, sometimes to forget, but above all, always to move forward.</p>",

It is really, really easy to fall into a relationship after leaving an abusive one, especially because you are not used to someone treating you well. Or even like a human being sometimes. Take time to be alone. Figure out who you are outside of your ex. Figure out what you want for yourself.

Make this list now while everything (the pain, the struggle, the relief) is fresh in your mind, and then make it again in a year. Refer back to it when you start dating, because honestly, you may question your future dating decisions (that<sq>s not a bad thing). <br><br><br>You did something amazing today.

When my 5 year relationship, my *engagement*, ended abruptly during an amicable conversation while driving home from a happy Superbowl party.  When I was completely blindsided.  When we had to somehow walk back into that condo together. The condo we<sq>d bought together.  That we<sq>d torn apart and remodeled together.  Walk back in there to our two cats, our couch that we<sq>d picked out together, our houseplants, our bed. Ours, ours, ours. <br><br>I<sq>m 8 years past that now. I<sq>m happy.  I<sq>m deeply in love. I have two children. I have a garden. I<sq>m pursuing a degree I never thought I<sq>d get. I live in a different state and have a different life.  I no longer think about my ex every day.  I no longer feel like I<sq>m going to die.  I no longer feel like my world is a crumbled mess that I have to sort through.<br><br>So that<sq>s the good news.  You<sq>ll get there too. <br><br>The bad news is that it<sq>ll take awhile. These first few days are going to be awful. The first few weeks are going to be awful.  The first few months will feel like a blur when you look back on them. <br><br>Tell yourself right now that this pain is temporary.  <dq>This too shall pass.<dq>  It always does.  <br><br>You<sq>re experiencing a death right now.  Grieve it like a death. This is the death of the life you<sq>ve made together. Death is part of life. Give yourself time and space to grieve the way you need to, and don<sq>t let anyone steal your grief. <br><br>You<sq>ll move through this at your own pace, in your own way.  Let the feelings come and don<sq>t try to block them or stuff them down.  But don<sq>t hang onto them.  Let them move through you and dissipate.  Feelings always give way to other feelings. You will not feel this way forever.<br><br>Do not be a victim.  Do not be a martyr.  Though both roles can be sickly gratifying, they<sq>re also exhausting, and they<sq>ll wear you out.  They<sq>ll brand you as the <dq>damaged girl<dq> that insecure abusive guys will gravitate towards, trying to fix by controlling and manipulating, and ultimately burning at the stake when you don<sq>t cooperate. Don<sq>t be that girl.<br><br>Be with your pain and learn from it. This is an experience that connects you to other human beings.  This is pain that almost every adult human has gone through in some way or another.  The loss, the grief, the eventual healing.  Let it connect you.  Reach out and share your experience and connect with people.  Let this experience make you more fully human. <br><br>I<sq>m sorry, sweetie. I know how confusing coping is.  I cried a lot, drank a lot of wine, moved out into the jungle for 8 months for what I call my <dq>Monk Phase<dq> (where I basically picked guava and papayas and pineapple, wore a lot of sarongs, stopped shaving my body hair and never started again, watched a lot of comedy on DVD, and learned how to hack things up with a machete), moved back home to the bosom of my family for awhile, went through a series of short and shitty relationships with emotionally abusive guys because I felt like a sack of shit, and then eventually forgave him and myself and the universe and picked myself up by my damn bootstraps again.  What a rush! <br><br>But hey, remember... I<sq>m happy.  I<sq>m in love. I<sq>m a mother. I<sq>m getting a STEM degree. I<sq>m okay.  You will be too. <br><br>EDIT<colon>  Whoa.  I<sq>m a little, um, overwhelmed? Thank you so much for reading what I wrote, everyone.  I<sq>m going to have an amazing day today, and probably do a little reflection on what the whole experience did in my life. Before last night, I hadn<sq>t thought about it in a long time.

For 3 months. Then just stopped. Picked myself up and started focusing on working out and bettering myself and my life. I started cleansing- as in giving away most of the material belongings I owned to people who had nothing. I kept the bare minimum and I spent time learning to love myself again and learning who I was again. With long relationships that are damaged and cause a lot of pain you tend to lose yourself and at the end it<sq>s important to take time to find yourself again. And when I felt I could handle it again I went into just going on dates and hanging out and eventually found the love of my life.

It still pushes you around, and pushes you down into the water as it tries to suck you into the ocean of grief, but you keep standing. As time goes on the waves of grief continue hitting you, but they are weaker, and smaller, and you are affected but not consumed. Eventually, you are just walking through the small tides, it is always a part of you, it is something you will always wade in, but it no longer consumes you.

                "answer": "<p>Awwwww honey. <br><br>I react to grief this way too. My sex drive is GONE after a loss that really gets to me. It<sq>s happened twice in my life 9 years apart, with losses less traumatizing than the violent death of a daughter, and both times there was ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING WAY I would have been ready to have sex a few weeks later. With the most recent one it was nearly a year from the time the grief started until I even had enough sex drive to masturbate.<br><br>You do not need to worry about your sex drive or even about your boyfriend right now. You need to mourn your daughter and survive your trauma. Those are your only priorities.  <br><br>> I am able to function, eat, sleep, go to work and do day to day things without crying and wanting to die I can talk about the good times and tell cute stories about her<br><br>YOU ARE DOING GREAT! <br><br>As your therapist has probably told you, the first year after a significant loss like this one is the hardest by far. The first week is harder than the first month is harder than the first year, but the first year is harder than anything you<sq>ve ever had to face in life, and hopefully harder than anything you<sq>ll face in the future. You need to give yourself *at least* a full year before you put ANY kind of pressure on yourself to <dq>move on<dq> in any way whatsoever. <br><br>It<sq>s impressive as FUCK that you are functioning and working right now. You are a badass mom and if there<sq>s an afterlife, somewhere your daughter is probably really glad that her death didn<sq>t destroy you completely. <br><br>Sex is the LAST thing you need to worry about at all. If you love the boyfriend and he<sq>s otherwise been a good man to you, talk to your grief counselor about him joining a few sessions and having her work with him to better understand what you<sq>re going through. But if you<sq>ve had *any* other issues that make you question the relationship, honestly this is a big enough deal to just break it off and get the stress off your plate. <br><br>BTW - the first time this happened to me I stayed with the guy I was with, we had a miserable 3 years of dating after my loss, I started having sex with him again earlier than I was really comfortable, and I left that relationship feeling like I was a broken person who could no longer enjoy sex. Turned out I was just permanently turned off to him because I was so repulsed by him attaching to my body when I wasn<sq>t ready. I ended up seeing him like a nursing baby, not a sex partner--some sort of immature organism that was desperate to feed off of my body to survive. Thinking that he <dq>needed<dq> sex in a way I didn<sq>t was the only way I was able to have sex with him, but it destroyed my attraction to him permanently.<br><br>The second time this happened to me, I was smarter. I was with a better guy who understands that sex is not an inalienable right that trumps your partner<sq>s ability to grieve. I also had the self-knowledge to know that it<sq>s gonna be a long fuckin<sq> time before I feel better enough to have sex, so I told him that very clearly. Unfortunately although he was able to handle the no-sex-indefinitely, he ended up saying something super insensitive about my loss, so we split up for several months, he went on a bit of a deprivation binge and fucked around a bunch, and we started talking again recently and I think we<sq>ll be friends.<br><br>But, neither time was I able to save the relationship (nor do I think it would have been smart to try much harder to do so). It takes a true life partner to support you through a life-altering loss. Unfortunately most people really aren<sq>t even good at handling their own grief, and handling someone else<sq>s grief at this kind of intensity is even harder.</p>",

It all depends on the context, the person<sq>s resiliency, and support from close family and friends. But I think it<sq>s safe to say that 2 months to grieve for the death of your 20 y/o daughter is **no where near enough time** to fully grieve. Then you consider the fact that she was with a very sketchy man with <dq>an extensive criminal history<dq> which I<sq>m sure doesn<sq>t make it easier for you.

I<sq>m inclined to suggest that you, at the very least, take a break from him.

Why am I even considering it... <br><br>**You shut the fuck up right now.** <br><br>Re-read this post, and the posts you made before it. Yes, it hurts, but don<sq>t entertain these objectively stupid ideas.<br><br>Your marriage is over. He chose your sister, got her pregnant, and now your parents are going to have choose sides. Even if your parents don<sq>t consent to this marriage, but stand by and allow these sorts of actions to continue in your family, then fuck them. They<sq>re just as bad as your sister and husband.<br><br>There<sq>s a strong possibility you<sq>ll have to endure all this alone, and it<sq>s *going to fucking suck*. It<sq>s impossible to expect better after a ten year marriage gone Jerry Springer. You<sq>ll neglect yourself. You<sq>ll eat shitty food, assuming you eat at all. You<sq>ll probably have no motivation to get on with your life, and who can blame you? You<sq>ve just had the rug pulled from beneath your feet, with no answers to give you the closure you need.<br><br>It<sq>s going to be tough. You know that. <br>*And you<sq>re afraid of just how tough it<sq>s going to be, so you<sq>re finding yourself wanting to cling to something your marriage used to resemble.*<br><br>**DON<sq>T.**<br><br><br>DO NOT pretend that  you can make some sort of arrangement with your ~~husband~~ Ex-Husband. <br><br>Look at what you wrote. Even after getting your sister pregnant and leaving you, he offered to get you pregnant if you still wanted. A man who offers this sort of thing with so little tact is not a man who can be reasoned with, and is not a man who can offer you any sort of stability that you<sq>re in extreme deficit of right now.<br><br>Is this the sort of man who deserves your attention, your crying, your anguish and lamentation? Is ten years worth that?<br><br>**TEN YEARS OF YOUR LIFE AND DEVOTION HAS GONE TO THIS MAN. HE DOES NOT DESERVE ANY MORE OF YOUR ATTENTION, AND YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR SISTER FOR THE RIGHT TO GIVE IT TO HIM.** <br><br>This is the time for you to get your shit together, even if just temporarily, and put your big girl hat on. You take a step back and look at the big picture<colon> that everything about the world your sister and husband chose to step into is nothing but one big shitstorm, and that **you need to fight your damndest to stay out of it.**<br><br><br>Let your sister deliver the divorce papers. Take them, and don<sq>t say anything to her that would give her the satisfaction of knowing that she walked all over you. Be cordial, keep it brief, and let whatever unnecessary things she says to rile you up go in one ear and out the other. <br><br><br>Have a lawyer take a good, long look over everything written in there. Make absolutely certain that everything is in order. Once it<sq>s verified that you will receive **ALL** the assets, then take it **ALL** before these two fools realize how what kind of batshit insanity they<sq>re marrying into and decide not to follow through with it.<br><br><br>Then, when all is said and done, you leave and abandon all reminders of this old life. Don<sq>t look at their profiles on Facebook. If Facebook is something you absolutely can<sq>t avoid, then create a new profile and only add the people who aren<sq>t close to your sister and husband. Don<sq>t add your family, their families, their friends. Don<sq>t follow them on instagram, twitter, reddit, whatever the fuck people follow other people on. This isn<sq>t news though; this is some advice from the ancients that just happens to be the hardest to follow.<br><br>There<sq>s no point in telling you to keep busy and not think about it, because you<sq>re allowed to (and almost inevitably will) mourn. But grieve only for however long it takes until you eventually realize how sick and tired you are of being in a constant state of emotional exhaustion by the actions of two selfish people. Don<sq>t keep re-opening that wound even though some part of that pain feels good, because then you won<sq>t be able to rebuild yourself. <br><br>Try to look at life from a newly-single perspective, and enjoy the things you could not have enjoyed as a married woman. Travel somewhere pretty. Focus on improving yourself, and allow your time to be consumed by your own hobbies and needs. Re-learn how to be comfortable being by yourself, and then you can dip your toes back into that dating pool again. You should be fine; you<sq>re still young after all, but don<sq>t go diving in headfirst. Take baby steps.<br><br>You<sq>ll be fine. <br><br>And if this is a troll post... well, fuck.</p>",

Women need to respect their men and men need to show their wives they love them. Read books from the start about marriage. <dq>The five love languages<dq> by Gary Chapman is a great start! Make sure you establish your roles. Don<sq>t talk crap about your spouse to your family, if you have a problem you can confide in them, but don<sq>t run to them every time your spouse messes up. Learn how to work through problems without anger. Don<sq>t be controlling! Don<sq>t let your own insecurities ruin a great thing. Always.... ALWAYS be your spouses friend, meaning don<sq>t treat your friends better than you would your spouse. Work together, not against each other if there is problems. You won<sq>t always agree, understand it and be flexible. Learn to compromise, learn to apologize and always forgive. Don<sq>t stop having sex, don<sq>t stop being vulnerable, don<sq>t stop flirting. If you wouldn<sq>t want it done to you, don<sq>t do it to them. Be transparent!! No lies! No cheating! If it happens, you can work it out. Always remember what brought you together. <br><br>Lastly, let go of expectations. Expectations are a form of passive control. <br><br>edited for additional content. </p>",

People with cheating spouses and kids. People who<sq>s partners actually slept with other parties (that<sq>s my awesome experience!) and they hate life and it hurts and it<sq>s horrible .....but in the end you are going to be left with yourself.

She fucked up. You found out and made some mistakes. You packed your bags. You LEFT and you never looked back. You never spoke to her again. Be that guy. <br><br><br></p>",

Its tough to hear, but communication is important.  But at that point, when you say <dq>no<dq> she has to decide whether she can accept your no or not.  If yes, then the relationship continues on monogamous.  If no, then the best thing is to break up and move on.  She said yes but (eventually) chose no, but didnt tell you that she changed her mind.  <br><br>And now, you can never know if she would do it again.  Like I said, how fast did she jump on the chance when he asked her? Minutes?  She cant be all that into you if thats the case (or at least, is in to him WAY more).<br><br>And then when she confessed to you, it wasnt because she was guilty.  Its because Ned got caught by his SO, who probably threatened to tell you.  So Elle got word from Ned, and she did the only thing she could do to get control of the situation and told you herself.

Look at women around you.  Even when they aren<sq>t particularly beautiful on their own, they often smell good or have a flattering haircut, or are otherwise making an effort.  Newsflash<colon> you will have more success with girls if you put in at least a modicum of effort in return.  Don<sq>t dress like a slob.  You don<sq>t have to become a metrosexual and start wearing name brands or anything, but too many of my <dq>forever alone<dq> friends just don<sq>t seem to understand that their looks matter.  Or even worse, they insist that their looks don<sq>t matter.<br><br>It logically doesn<sq>t make sense.  They like it when women are attractive and clean; it goes both ways.  Take a shower before you leave the house.  Get a fucking haircut.  If your jeans have holes in them, then you need new jeans.  Don<sq>t wear your comfortable t-shirt out on a Friday night.  If your favorite sweatshirt has a huge stain on it, it<sq>s time to throw that shit out and buy a new one on Ebay.  <br><br>Clothes can be expensive, but you can go to thrift stores, or department stores that have big sales.  Do not bitch about the price of clothes in one breath and then complain about how alone you are and buy a video game to keep you company in the next.  <br><br>I see a lot of guys who have <dq>security blankets,<dq> so to speak.  Some people have afros.  Afros?  Not bad.  Unkempt, untrimmed, and nasty afros?  Bad.  Sideburns?  Not bad.  Untrimmed, uneven, scraggly pube sideburns?  Bad.   Bottom line<colon> take care of your goddamn self already.  <br><br>*  If you are severely overweight, either do something about it (if it makes you unhappy) or accept that your dating pool is slightly altered.  My friend is morbidly obese and only attracted to really fit, beautiful women.  He<sq>s a great guy, and if he just fucking hit the gym, he might actually land one of those fit, beautiful women.  We could argue about whether or not it<sq>s fair, or a million different caveats, but generally you are more attractive if you are in shape.  That<sq>s the way it goes.<br><br>*  If a flirting/dating situation ends poorly, you can ask (politely) what you did wrong.  If she feels comfortable telling you, then be respectful<colon> open and willing to hear it.  Then assimilate her advice *with the next girl*.  You aren<sq>t going to be able to salvage things with the initial girl, but that<sq>s just fucking fine.  Plenty of women out there, and now you even have a leg-up on your previous technique.</p>",

She has proven herself to be a terrible, unreliable babysitter. If she cannot care for her three year old granddaughter without taking heroin, she has no place in her life. <br><br>You say you<sq>ve seen first hand what this drug can do, so I hope you understand the gravity of the situation. Your MIL<sq>s actions could have seriously harmed your baby - not just because she could have acted irrationally whilst on the drug, but also because she could have passed out and been unable to care for your daughter. <br><br>You need to sit down with your wife, and show her the evidence. You both seem fairly chilled about her drug use, which is mildly concerning, but you also seemed certain she would not do drugs whilst babysitting. If you and your wife do not decide to cut MIL out entirely, you need to have a plan about what she can and cannot do. I would personally recommend that you cease contact with MIL until she has done 12+ months of rehab. Then you can reevaluate - if she is better, perhaps your wife could meet her without the baby for a chat. I would never let MIL see my child again until she had proof that she was 12 months drug free, but you and your wife can make that decision. <br><br>Your daughter will grow up just fine without her grandmother. In fact, I think she would be one hundred times better off if she never came into contact with her again. She won<sq>t hate you, she will be proud of you for sticking up for her and protecging her against a woman who cares so little about her granddaughter that she happily takes heroin whilst watching her. Think about this very carefully. If you allow MIL back into your life without boundaries, you are enabling her to continue to make terrible decisions. <br><br></p>",

It was terrible, but after some communicating he ended up being the best sex of my life. <br><br>First step is to have an honest, non-sexual conversation about expectations. Make sure to tell him you *really* like him, but that you need sexual fulfillment in a relationship. Let him know that he should never feel embarrassed about finishing too soon or not being at full mast or anything else that may happen. Tell him that you<sq>re hard to please (even if you<sq>re not) and that you want to teach him how to please you.<br><br>Step 2<colon> make him watch you touch yourself. Don<sq>t allow him to participate and make sure he<sq>s really paying attention to what you do. In watching how you handle yourself he can learn how to handle you. <colon>) Added bonus it<sq>s really hot and kinky to be watched. <br><br>Step 3<colon> get some toys! When Jr. decides he doesn<sq>t want to participate you can keep the fun going! That helps loosen tensions, especially relating to performance anxiety. Plus instead of jack-hammering you with his fingers you can use a vibrator that doesn<sq>t require much motion. <br><br>The biggest help I found with limp noodles is cock rings. They help the penis stay hard longer just make sure he<sq>s hard when you put it on. Don<sq>t get the vibrating ones though because it<sq>ll probably make him finish very quickly. <br><br>I think that communicating is the biggest factor. If he still won<sq>t listen then maybe move on. For me, sex is super important so I couldn<sq>t be with someone who isn<sq>t willing to try to fulfill me. I hope everything goes well. </p>",

Talking things through is something we think we all want, but trust me you<sq>re better off. There is no magic phrase that made what she did okay or make you feel better. any discussion with her would just be her avoiding guilt and blaming you for Anynactions which were her own fault, and you getting angry at her - a waste of time. You wanted a committed relationship, she said she did too, and then changed her mind. This shows that she did not want the relationship you wanted, and so leaving rather than continuing to stay and fight is a blessing in disguise,<br><br>She<sq>s out of your life. I<sq>m aware there may be costs, or legal issues to be settled, but as much as possible let her be out of your life. You will need to grieve, not for her (fuck her!) but for the future you thought you had with her. Don<sq>t be alone. If you have friends or family you can stay with for a while, stay with them. Yes, your instinct will say as a strong man you should be able to live by yourself, not going home to your parents when times get rough. Fuck that thought, you are hurt and you need to be with people who can look after you (at least for stuff like food, checking in if you<sq><sq>re okay, basic life things) while you try to adjust to your new life. You know what, when I found my gf was cheating on me (a much smaller relationship compared to yours) I went to my childhood home, when my parents were overseas, and just cried on my childhood bed for a few hours. Yes, it<sq>s childish, yes it<sq>s immature, yes I was supposed to be an adult, but fuck being an adult, right at that second I needed to be a child to cope with the pain, so that the next day I could start returning to adulthood. <br><br>Start thinking of your ex as an evil bitch, at least initially. You have been hurt badly, and someone seriously broke your trust, and that can make it hard to trust people again in the future. Thinking of your ex as evil can reduce those thoughts a bit (without actually hurting anyone- remember, she<sq>s out of your life you don<sq>t need to care about her anymore), as new people aren<sq>t seen as evil. Also, if you have friends you can hang out with, don<sq>t be polite about your ex- you know how you would only bring the best of your relationship when you were out with friends? Now is the time to show everything, warts and all, glorify the worst aspects of your relationship, because first off you get your friends to support you, and secondly the more you think of the worst part of the relationship, the more grateful you will be that she is gone. <br><br>Then we<sq>re just talking about general advice for break ups. Keep busy. Do something every day which gets you out of the house, and preferably tires you out. itmfights off depression and fights thoughts of her form your mind. <br><br>It will get better. You will find yourself again, and find yourself as a single person like you were before. But not right now, and you shouldn<sq>t expect to be like that right now</p>",

I would expect that local laws prevail.<br><br><br>From your description the images are sexually explicit and whether you want to report your brother to the police or not, I would think there is a chance that he might get into legal trouble at some point for possessing and distributing the material.

You forfeit your rights to privacy if you use it to do bad things.  Simple.<br><br><br>I think it will be good for your sanity to talk about it with someone who can reassure you of the right thing to do.  I would suggest that perhaps you speak to someone with knowledge about this kind of situation (but best to hide that it<sq>s your brother for now) and see whether they think the police should be involved.  You might even be able to phone up the local police and ask them a vague question on an anonymous basis (pay phone)?  Counselors may also be able to help you as they deal with abuse cases regularly and will have some knowledge of the legalities involved.  If the police wants to get involved, you could request to remain anonymous and no one has to know you reported it.  If your brother has been sharing the images it is plausible that someone else could have reported it.  Investigation would include ceasing your brother<sq>s computer and it wouldn<sq>t need to concern you publicly.<br><br><br>2.<br>As another poster said, your sister might be subject to abuse, but unfortunately the Japanese legal system allows the <dq>modelling<dq> to happen and there is nothing you can do about that, and there might be very little you can do about what her parents get her involved in.  I would suggest that you ask her what things she has to do / what things are done to her in a discreet way, before raising alarms with the rest of the family.  You can come at it from a kind of <dq>I<sq>ve seen some of your pictures from work and I never had a job at your age so I<sq>m curious about what you have to do<dq> angle.  You might also have luck asking in some Japanese subreddits about the industry or even in /r/AskReddit.  If it you have suspicions that she is being abused, it might be time to get your family involved, but that is entirely your decision.  If you have suspicions that your brother ever abused her, it would be time to notify the authorities.  Do save the conversations/emails you have with her if you do decide to ask her, they will be important if the police carries out an investigation.<br><br><br>I hope it all works out for you.

I<sq>ve been in a similar situation or at least my ex basically said she didn<sq>t even see me as a friend let alone a husband so I kind of understand. <br><br>1. Contact a divorce attorney. You need to find out your options here and start a game plan to protect yourself and your daughter. This is something you don<sq>t want to sleep on.<br><br>2. Are you positive there<sq>s no other man? This is so important to find out in these early stages of believing your marriage might end. If you want to save your marriage you have to find this out and take steps to stop it like exposure etc. Either way find this out if you can, and you can.<br>3. Start doing things to improve yourself. How is your self confidence? Are you in decent shape and do your take good care of yourself? If you answer no to that then do something about it. Start exercising, eating right and improving yourself to increase your confidence. This is going to be a HUGE help to you no matter how things go. <br>4. Choose your words wisely. When talking to your wife about this situation be careful what you say and how you say it. You don<sq>t want to come across as needy and desperate, that is a huge turn off, but you also don<sq>t want to come across as an uncaring asshole. Just don<sq>t say anything that can come back to haunt you later on and don<sq>t let her boss you around or cater to her unrealistic BS demands. <br>5. Have you had a part in this? It<sq>s unlikely for a wife to just one day tell you she doesn<sq>t like you. There<sq>s typically a pattern of neglect or indications that things are not cool. Examine yourself and how you have treated her to find out if you<sq>ve done things to push her away.<br>6. Realize that you deserve to be happy. Unless you<sq>re a total asshole who has pushed your marriage into the ground you just don<sq>t deserve any of this. Sometimes people do selfish things that hurt the people who love them. <br><br><br>The things is when you<sq>re told by the person you decided to spend your life with ESPECIALLY one who you share a child with, it<sq>s hard to push forward and do what you need to do. It<sq>s easy to just hide your head in sadness and shame. Don<sq>t do those things. If you like I could point you towards a really great blog that I wish I<sq>d found years before my marriage went bad. Send me a message if you<sq>re interested.<br><br>Good luck!</p>",

I was in grad school, suffering from depression and anxiety, drinking and smoking way too much, and completely at a loss as to what I was going to do with my life.<br><br>I started becoming obsessed with a band that has an association with some other videos/celebrities. I was particularly fascinated by the lead singer, but anything involving the band and the other celebrities they were linked to would draw me in. I didn<sq>t go quite as far as your girlfriend in terms of merch, mostly because all of my money went to alcohol and weed, but I was certainly on that path.<br><br>In retrospect, it really wasn<sq>t so much about the band, but about this weird fantasy world where I was friends with these people. Their demographic is also primarily teenage girls, and I think in a way I was wishing I was 16 again and had not yet fucked up my life in various ways and still had the entirety of my adult future ahead of me.<br><br>I finished grad school (with a lot of support from my awesome cohort and academic advisors), and was able to get my depression treated, get my drinking under control, and stop smoking entirely. When I was mentally healthy, my interest in the band all but diminished.<br><br>I still like a few of their songs, but I don<sq>t spend hours googling photos of the band and watching shitty compilation videos of their interviews, etc.<br><br>Your girlfriend needs help, and while she may realize that, she probably doesn<sq>t recognize that her obsession has anything to do with it. Bear in mind that a lack of interest can also be a sign of depression, so it could be that the band is the only thing that makes her feel anything (even negative emotions, like crying over the bad review). That<sq>s a horrible place to be.<br><br>I would recommend gently pushing her to seek help, but leave her obsession with the band out of it, for now. I think you will be more successful if you come from a place of concern (<dq>Hey, I<sq>m kind of worried about your mood; is everything okay? What can we do?<dq>) instead of frustration with her obsession (<dq>I think you need help because you are obsessed with this band<dq>). <br><br>Sorry for the novel, this struck a chord with me.<br><br>**TL;DR<colon> This is probably a symptom of some other mental distress.**</p>",

Discuss with your wife why she doesn<sq>t want to tell anyone. Ask her, <dq>What reasons do you have for not talking to anyone about this?<dq> or something like that. During the conversation you can also bring up to her why you are so worried about her and how important you think it is to get help. Approaching it this way will make you a part of her team instead of going behind her back, even if telling someone is the right thing to do.<br><br>2. Come up with some ideas of people you could talk to that you know she would feel comfortable with. Maybe church members/ pastors? Therapists? Neutral friends that are not part of either family? That way when and if she finally decides to talk to someone, that person will already be on standby.<br><br>3. Continue to support her, even if her decision making doesn<sq>t make sense to you.

I hope I<sq>m explaining that well, it<sq>s an odd thing to but in words. <br><br>My fianc\u00e9e and I also have very different interests. In fact we are in a lot of ways different <dq>types<dq> of people. The key to that sort of relationship is finding interest in your SO<sq>s interest. For example you don<sq>t like makeup, which is fine obviously, but you should enjoy talking about it sometimes simply because you like hearing about her and her life (plus people<sq>s passions, even when they aren<sq>t your own, are an amazing thing to hear about.) Do I give two shits about the new Supergirl show my SO is really into right now? Not at all- I don<sq>t even like TV at all while she<sq>s a huge tv/cinephile- but I love hearing her talk about what she loves, and I appreciate her letting me be apart of those areas of her life. If you don<sq>t feel that second hand enjoyment in your SO<sq>s interests I<sq>m not sure what that means, but it cannot be good imo. <br><br>So that issue alone is not necessarily a deal breaker. I definitely don<sq>t think it<sq>s worth breaking up over. However you seem to have a bit of contempt towards your SO<sq>s hobbies/lifestyle. I also had this problem as I originally thought my so<sq>s likes were petty in comparison to mine. This, I think you will find, is simply a form of arrogance and elitism as it was for me. So what if she doesn<sq>t keep up with <dq>what<sq>s going on in the world<dq>? Some people (my so included, this was a point of contention for us for a time so I understand where you are coming from) just are not interested in news/politics/etc. <br><br>You have to embrace the fact that you two are very different people, and enjoy-not resent- those differences.

Your only responsibility is to examine your own feelings about the relationship and the ways in which you may have contributed to his insecurities.

HIS responsibility to the relationship is to try to understand your reasons for not wanting to do this small gesture, address his own insecurities and work on eradicating them, and possibly go to therapy.<br><br>(21/f who dated an emotionally abusive male for 4 years)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Gay guy here. I<sq>ve been in two similar situations. In the first, I messed about with a straight friend and we never talked about it afterwards. In the second, a friend who was questioning his sexuality asked me on a date and a few months of dating and shy kissing (no sex) later I was completely head-over-heels, only for him to withdraw completely and cut off contact with no explanation. I think you are closer to my first experience, but have the potential to get involved in something like the second. <br><br>My advice is, as others have mentioned, to send him a message and tell him that you<sq>re ready to talk about it whenever he is. It sounds like you guys have a great friendship which I<sq>m sure you both value a lot, and talking about it will clear the air and probably strenghten that friendship. But, unless it<sq>s eating you up, give him some time to process things and get ready to talk with you.<br><br>It sounds like you are able to put some separation between the sex and the friendship (I<sq>m referring to your one-night stand guy<sq> comment), so you could possibly go on being friends without it getting in the way if he is also able to do that. The big mistake I made in my first situation was not making the first move and offering to be there to talk about it, which meant the friendship became really awkward because he was too afraid to bring it up. As gay guys, we<sq>re used to having sex with other guys (even just for one night), but for someone who possibly doesn<sq>t understand what happened it may be really difficult to bring it up. I was able to just put what happened between my friend and I in my <sq>hot sexual experiences<sq> box without too much trouble; I doubt he has had it as easy and the fact that he is left with that confusion is my fault for not being the bigger man. So, yeah, I suggest you do raise the issue first - give him time and space, of course, but do reach out and let him know you<sq>re there as a friend. <br><br>The key there is *as a friend*. My advice<colon> sleep with him again or get otherwise romantically entangled **if and only if** he is <sq>sorted out<sq> i.e. he comes out to himself and others as gay/bi/queer. I really would advise you against getting intimate in any non-friendy way with him unless that is the case. Be there as a friend, but not as a <sq>sexperiment<sq> and make this clear to him. It can be really, really painful as it was for me in my second experience.<br><br>Finally, you describe this as the <sq>hottest and most intimate sex<sq> you<sq>ve ever had. Of course it has its unique thrill (definitely unique, it will never have the same thrill the second time), but<colon> you can get hotter and more intimate sex with other guys, other gay guys who are ready for more kinds of intimacy. It sounds to me that you really enjoyed and valued that intimacy that you shared (built up over years of what sounds like a really great friendship), so though you describe yourself as a <sq>one night stand<sq> guy maybe you are looking for something more than just one night of hot sex. Just make sure you look for that with someone who is able to give as much as you are.<br><br><br></p>",

The thing to look for is if they reach out to trusted loved ones and ask for help with accountability. If this guy were compliant with best practices for living safely as someone with those predatory tendencies, he would be reaching out to *you* or your husband and establishing rules and boundaries for his contact with your child, with the understanding that the best thing for him is supervision and accountability--both to keep the child safe and because the more eyes on him, the less likely he could be falsely suspected even if he was totally well-behaved with the child.<br><br>Because this post doesn<sq>t have anything in it about your FIL participating in this conversation in a way that shows self-knowledge and a desire to take responsibility for his behavior, I can tell you 100<percent> that experts in treatment of sexual predators would not advise you to have your FIL involved in your child<sq>s life in any way.

I would just phrase it that since she has lost weight that band size in the swimsuit is making the cup size off. For example, a 34 C is the same as a 36 B and a 32 D. You subtract two sizes in the band for going up a cup size and add two for going down one. When a lady at a lingerie shop showed me this, it made me a lot less attached to wearing a D or C or whatever because some of the sizes are going to be completely equal. So blame it on the band and then when she<sq>s at the store let the retail assistant take the heat when you suggest letting the assistant help. If anything about cup size is brought up, let someone who works at the shop do it. Just stick to the problem being the band - I loved to hear that I was skinny near my chest and that was what was causing the problem instead of that I<sq>d dropped a cup size. </p>",

You were having fun, period, end of story. <br><br>Her entire response is one of the most manipulative, guilt-tripping things I<sq>ve ever heard. <br><br>You are not responsible for her mental illness. You are trying to live your life. Being a caretaker for a family member is incredibly exhausting both physically and emotionally. You need to be able to get out and live a normal life sometimes or you<sq>re going to run into caregiver burnout syndrome. <br><br>If I were you, I would do what the other posters said and look into finding a professional to take care of her to take some of the weight off your shoulders. This kind of behavior from her is ridiculous and it can cause serious problems for your mental well-being. <br><br>I<sq>ve been in your shoes before somewhat. I helped my boyfriend take care of his grandmother who was suffering from dementia while the rest of his family refused to believe there was anything wrong with her.

Sometimes it<sq>s nice to have a conversation when stressful situations like this one arise as opposed to just making the post and asking for advice. It used to help me to have conversations where the other person validated my concerns and sometimes brought up things I hadn<sq>t even thought of which helped me gather my thoughts about the situation better. <br><br>I wish you the best of luck in dealing with this.

I<sq>m old. What that means is that I<sq>ve survived (so far) and a lot of people I<sq>ve known and loved did not. I<sq>ve lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can<sq>t imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here<sq>s my two cents.<br><br>>I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don<sq>t want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don<sq>t want it to <dq>not matter<dq>. I don<sq>t want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can<sq>t see.<br><br>>As for grief, you<sq>ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you<sq>re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it<sq>s some physical thing. Maybe it<sq>s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it<sq>s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.<br><br>>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don<sq>t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you<sq>ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what<sq>s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.<br><br>>Somewhere down the line, and it<sq>s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O<sq>Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you<sq>ll come out.<br><br>>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don<sq>t really want them to. But you learn that you<sq>ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you<sq>ll survive them too. If you<sq>re lucky, you<sq>ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Hey. I went through this situation as one of your daughters, essentially. I was 17 when my parents all of a sudden separated (with direct intent to divorce), because my father had an affair, the product of which was twins - my half-sisters. It took about 18 months for them to complete the divorce. <br><br>I<sq>m not happy to say this, but this is going to be messy. You<sq>ve been married a long time (my parents were married for 19 years), and you<sq>ve accumulated a lot of mutual possessions; read<colon> lots of grey matter. One or the other should probably leave the house. Emotions don<sq>t run cool during this period. Don<sq>t throw things away, or damage them - tempting as it may be, as his behavior has been horrid. (I didn<sq>t speak to my father for about 2 years after the divorce. We were all *very* upset, to say the least.)<br><br>Now, you were asking about telling your daughters. Do it. Rip the band-aid off. They<sq>re old enough - older than I was then, by the sound of it - and no one likes to be taken for a fool. I<sq>m sure you feel the same way, given what your husband did. I wouldn<sq>t want to pass that behavior on. There<sq>s going to be some drastic changes at <sq>home<sq> (I<sq>m assuming they don<sq>t live at home anymore, which is great, given the trouble). They should be privy to at least the bare minimum of those changes. <br><br>How to tell friends and family? Same as above. You<sq>ll find a lot of advocates doing so. This is not your fault. It<sq>s such a difficult situation. People that you<sq>ve built relationships with *will* love and support you through this. <br><br>**Definitely get a lawyer**. I<sq>m assuming child support isn<sq>t a factor, so instead of family law, you<sq>re probably better off with a divorce lawyer. I know it<sq>s the weekend, but do some web research so you know what you<sq>re getting into Monday morning. <br><br>Lastly, as /u/brokedown aptly mentioned, eventually your children<sq>s half-sister will be on the scene (by hook or by crook). It really isn<sq>t her fault. I remember meeting my half-sisters - it was so surreal, but they were charming, sweet girls that didn<sq>t deserve any hostility from me, despite being a product of an affair that ultimately nuked my parents<sq> marriage. I<sq>m not saying don<sq>t be angry - that<sq>s unhealthy and unrealistic. But, if you have to be angry, direct those feelings towards your husband and Danielle. <br><br>This will be hard. It will suck, incredibly. (Trust me, nothing like watching your mother have a glass of wine and burst into tears. Or take up smoking. Or come home yelling that she<sq>ll chop your father<sq>s willy off because it turned out he<sq>d given her an STD.) <br><br>Some positive facts, if you<sq>ve actually read all of this<colon> That all happened 9 years ago. My mother was 14 years older than you when that happened. Guess what? She<sq>s married to a guy that adores her. Retired, and tooling around the country in an RV, riding off into the sunset every damn day. <br><br>**Tl<colon>dr**<colon> This blows. I was <dq>the kids<dq> in this situation. It will get shittier before it gets rosier, but you will come out the other side. Get a lawyer, and tell your friends and family the truth, because you<sq>ll need support.

Here<sq>s an example of such a program in the Boston area<colon> http<colon>//www.emergedv.com/<br><br>3. Please keep your friends and family updated; check in with them often, and ask them to check in with you.

Make a safety plan in case things escalate. Look up <sq>cycle of domestic abuse<sq>, the <sq>power and control wheel**,<sq> and other information on domestic violence. It will be easier to see more warning signs if you<sq>re educated.<br><br>To OP, and to everyone commenting urging him to leave, please be aware that statistically, **the majority of domestic violence fatalities happen after the victimized partner has ended, or attempted to end, the relationship.** A person not only needs to be ready to leave, but be prepared to cut off all contact and commit to a safety plan. On average, it takes upwards of seven times for an individual experiencing abuse to leave a romantic relationship.

Maybe that there were warning signs that you ignored, or just didn<sq>t recognize. And, of course, he<sq>ll tell you that it was a one time thing and, baby, he<sq>s so sorry. He was just so drunk and he didn<sq>t know what he was doing. It won<sq>t happen again. He didn<sq>t mean to hurt you, he wouldn<sq>t ever do anything to hurt you if he were sober!<br><br><br>But, here<sq>s the thing. It doesn<sq>t get any less embarrassing. It will happen again. And then, suddenly, you<sq>re the woman who has been with her husband for 6 years or 16 years and he<sq>s been hitting her for that whole time and everyone knows it but nobody will say anything because he<sq>s made you think that you deserve it by that point. You<sq>ll start to ditch your friends, like Maxine, that will help you and you<sq>ll start to separate yourself from your family members until you<sq>ve finally had enough. And you either don<sq>t have a job or you don<sq>t have a great one because you<sq>re so depressed. See, even if he doesn<sq>t hit you all the time or beat you up <dq>badly<dq> he has to keep you emotionally drained all the time so you don<sq>t get the bright idea of leaving him on the occasions he does hit you. And you have kids, not just cats. Maybe he yells at them and hits them too, maybe he doesn<sq>t. But they<sq>re growing up in that tense environment where it<sq>s normal. And maybe your son grows up thinking like him and your daughter thinks it<sq>s ok for a man do that to women. Meanwhile, you<sq>re still with him, and everyone who knows you and loves you still knows and wonders why you didn<sq>t leave that first time. And they all say they wouldn<sq>t have thought less of you for leaving after that first time because they love you and they only want what<sq>s best for you. <br><br><br>Then, maybe someday you get out. Maybe you just find the strength to leave. But you look even older than you are and you feel even older than you look. And you have nothing but a crap job that you may have to leave, if you have to go into a woman<sq>s shelter, and kids to take care of, and permanent scars and fear. Your family and friends are ecstatic, and all they say is, <dq>It<sq>s about time!<dq> But maybe it<sq>s worse. Maybe you never get out. Or maybe one of you kills the other. It happens, more than you think but not as often as it happens that the two just live together, forever. <br><br><br>I guess, what I<sq>m saying, is just leave. You can probably get an annulment this recently after the marriage was performed. Abusive partners are masters of disguise. It<sq>s true, maybe he won<sq>t hit you again for another six months, a year, however long, but it will happen again. The reason the events don<sq>t evoke emotions is because you are in shock. Nobody goes through life thinking that they might be an abused partner, so nobody prepares for it. <br><br><br>You can look at it this way. You<sq>re faced with the decision of<colon> <br><br><br>Being the woman who decided to go back to her husband after he  hit her, cornered her, threw both a garbage can and a cat scratching post at her, burned her belongings, and harassed her and her friend all night. <br><br><br>OR <br><br><br>Being the woman who didn<sq>t know her husband well enough when she married him, but when she learned that he was someone who would hit her, corner her, throw both a garbage can and a cat scratching post at her, burn her belongings, and harass her and her friend all night, decided she didn<sq>t want to be with him anymore. </p>",

I would try and figure this out at least a week in advance, but you could perhaps start with going over your schedules the night before and figuring out what everyone needs to do to be prepared for the day. Have a big schedule written down on a whiteboard or an easel or whatever. Color-code family members or businesses or what have you. (I know families that even do this with dinner. Meals already decided a week in advance. Then they know what to buy and how to use up everything so it doesn<sq>t go bad...)<br><br>And, standard places for things will help. Ex) I keep my keys on a board by the door. Always there. Never have to look. And once you start to do this, it<sq>ll be automatic. No more looking for purse. As well, if you prepped the night before, kid<sq>s brace would be by the door with her purse. She could even lay out her clothes for the next day. Saves a surprising amount of time.<br><br>Also, if I were you, I would stop assuming I might have 20 minutes to hang with the dog and drink coffee. (At least until you get a team schedule going.) Your wife is currently not responsible for her own schedule. You are expected to pick up the slack, otherwise it<sq>s all your fault. So, if I were in that situation, I would be <dq>ready to go<dq> so that I<sq>m best equipped not to make things my fault.<br><br>This is extremely frustrating.

Relationship of multiple years, he suffered from severe agoraphobia, to the extent that he wasn<sq>t able to leave the house at one stage and this lasted for several years. Couldn<sq>t work, I was paying all the bills for the both of us. I lost the best part of my twenties to this. <br><br>I felt so, so guilty. He wasn<sq>t facing up to the realities of his illness or really doing anything to get better. But he still loved me and I desperately wanted to love him too. I wanted us to be the fairytale story of love overcoming adversity. All my friends would tell me how strong and amazing I was... When inside I felt trapped, weak and actually quite resentful. <br><br>Over the years, the love disappeared. I tried to cling onto it. I tried to ignore the power imbalance. I made excuses for him over and over. And I ignored my feelings, over and over. <br><br>It got to the point where I couldn<sq>t feel. I had become depressed myself. I read a book on codependent relationships and it was like a light bulb flicked on in my head. It was a comfort to know I wasn<sq>t the only person experiencing this type of imbalance, and it helped me to pick apart all of my complicated and confusing feelings. <br><br>The book, by the way, was called codependent no more. I recommend you find a copy. <br><br>In the end, I left him. It really sucked, and he had to move back to his parents. It really, really hurt him, and it hurt me a hell of a lot too. But things had got so bad there would have been no rescuing us. <br><br>I<sq>m now several years down the line and you know what? I wish I had done it sooner. I wish I had been brave enough to face up to the reality of our relationship, and pragmatic enough to do something about it. I am now in a far, far better place. I have got my life back. And actually, me leaving him gave him the kick up the butt he needed to own his feelings. Because like it or not, I was enabling him. <br><br>In a situation like this no two are the same. I recommend you read that book. I recommend you think deeply about your feelings, and be aware of the sunk cost fallacy - don<sq>t stay just because you<sq>ve always stayed. In any successful relationship I believe it takes the two of you essentially asking every day, as of today, is this working? Am I happy? And if not, you address that as best you can together. But don<sq>t sacrifice yourself and your wellbeing because you feel you must. If you do stay, it should be out of a conscious commitment to do so. </p>",

I mean, I admit that would be a silly thing to lie about...but your mom has been married to your dad for how long? And all the sudden she is going to divorce him and move in with your best friend and get married? That all sounds like a HUGE rush and your friend might be getting ahead of himself with all of this. <br><br>You definitely need to ask your mother what is going on with the situation. Try to take her out for coffee or dinner and let her know what your friend said to you. It might be the most painful thing you have to do this year, but confronting her calmly and quietly is the next step for you. ESPECIALLY before telling your father. It might not be a bad idea to bring your girlfriend along when you confront your mom, if you trust your GF well enough. She might be able to help break a little bit of the tension or help diffuse the situation, should you or your mother get upset.  <br><br>And by the way, you have every right to be pissed at your friend for this! Maybe he didn<sq>t just start being friends with you to get to your mother, but he sure as hell violated the codes of friendship, that<sq>s for damn sure. Also, he contributed to the potential breaking up of your family and parents relationship. Your friend probably did not intentionally become friends with you to hook up with your mom, but that<sq>s the way this situation turned out. What you need to do is confront your mom and if this is all true, ask her what the hell she is going to do about your father? Maybe, just maybe, your parents have an open relationship where they are allowed to do this sort of thing...but I imagine moving in with men half her age is not part of that. </p>",

Not the kind of picky in that thread you mention, that guy was just annoying, but harder to find a long term relationship in general. <br><br>For example, in my first relationship I was with a girl for 5+ years who I wouldn<sq>t even have given two months now. Why? Because my lack of experience made me tolerate things I simply wouldn<sq>t tolerate now. As I<sq>ve grown and met many different people and had many different experiences it has without a doubt made it harder and harder to love innocently enough to make a long term relationship work out. <br><br>In that first relationship the girl treated me poorly, ended up cheating on me, and even then I thought I wanted to work through it. It took me a year to realize what was really going on. I<sq>m not willing to put up with that kind of crap anymore. I<sq>m not just talking about being treated badly either, there<sq>s other ways that experiences change you. I have a lot of great girlfriends who I totally respect where we still realized we couldn<sq>t continue. <br><br>All that said, I don<sq>t disagree with your point at all. I am always meeting new people who I enjoy. I still hold out hope for that special person who will change everything, and I think I<sq>ll eventually find her. I think right now it<sq>s been more about me not being ready for her, not the other way around. <br><br>Some people get lucky and stay with their first love forever. My two best friends are like that. They<sq>ve dated since high school and just got married a year ago. They have many of the same problems I<sq>ve experienced in my past yet they can look past them, in a way I haven<sq>t really been able to do since. They have had to deal with each other changing and luckily they are both stable enough to have done this together. <br><br>I, on the other hand, had to figure out who *I* am. I changed too much. How could I find this special person when I didn<sq>t even really know who *I* was? For me I really needed to figure out my own life first. I<sq>m only 24, so I feel no rush for time yet, but only now am I starting to feel like I *might* be ready to meet that girl. <br><br>So I guess what I<sq>m saying is experience is a double edged sword. Some of the problems which I see couples have<colon> I can<sq>t believe they are unfortunate enough to have to put up with them forever. Problems I once had, but through changing partners was able not only to realize existed but to grow out of and fix. My relationships are much healthier now - even if one hasn<sq>t lasted forever *yet*. But I have to admit... with many things sometimes ignorance does really seem like bliss.<br></p>",

What they will say. How they will stick to their boundaries however he reacts as if he does not understand or makes out they are being cruel or making him sad by imputing motives, which he might say shows they have dirty minds not him.

I<sq>ll recommend visiting appropriate city subreddits to try to find people to spend time with. Go to local meet ups, or even just throw a thread in there asking people to hang out and talk, or do an activity to get your mind off of it. <br><br>On top of this, you must find a way to get your mind off of it. It<sq>s going to be tough, but find new hobbies, things you<sq>ve always wanted to do, and start spending time getting into them, focus your attention.

Honestly I think she may just be exhausted. <br><br>I<sq>m going to make some big generalizations here, they may or may not apply. Women do go through big physical and emotional changes after having kids, but the hardest to cope with is just trying to take care of everything. No matter how hands on a father is, there is an oppressive sense of responsibility for every little thing felt by mothers. Working mothers also feel worse because they _have_ to make compromises and this provokes an oppressive sense of guilt. <br><br>It is hard after baby 1, but baby 2 can be crazy emotionally and physically draining. On top of that, many parents don<sq>t figure out how to get babies to sleep until baby is a year+. Which means that in an emotional crucible, they are tired, making thinking your way through things that much harder. <br><br>All of this combines to make many women, tense and exhausted - a complete libido killer. Many women need to relax before they can feel like sex is even a possibility. (Many men seem to use sex in order to relax and don<sq>t understand). Plus, I guarantee that she knows how you feel and it is another layer of guilt. She is possibly seeing it as another aspect of taking care of another person and the list is full. <br><br>My advice<colon> 1) Give her some time. 2) Do more around the house than asked even if you are already doing an equal share. 3) Get her some extra sleep (read a pop science study that for every additional hour of sleep per night for women leads to an 20<percent> increase in sexual activity - I swear it<sq>s true). 4) Don<sq>t worry too much about her body image stuff. It is pretty normal at 10 mos post partum to feel a weird disconnect with one<sq>s body. Taking care of 1-3 will give her space to figure it out. </p>",

And it<sq>s not because your relationship is broken (it<sq>s not), but because he<sq>s got feelings that need to be brought out into the open and dealt with.<br><br>I suspect that he is AFRAID, and that<sq>s why there<sq>s been no PIV sex.  What his specific fears are, we can only guess - perhaps that he<sq>ll hurt you somehow, would be my first guess, particularly given that you<sq>re describing someone who loves you.  He may be afraid that you won<sq>t physically respond to his love-making.  That you won<sq>t have the sensations you <dq>should<dq>, and he has no idea what he can do about that.<br><br>My husband and I have been together nearly 15 years.  We have a fantastic marriage, and his love for me seems limitless.  We also know one another extremely well, and I can tell you that I am positive that if we were in your situation, with me in a wheelchair and paralyzed as you are, my husband would be reacting the same way yours is.<br><br>The primary reason would be that my husband would feel completely POWERLESS to <dq>make it all better.<dq>  This is a man who, to some extent (not excessive, but still there) mentally <dq>beats himself up<dq> if I<sq>ve got so much as a toothache that he can<sq>t make better right away.  <br><br>I have fibromyalgia and some serious back damage from when I was a firefighter... on my bad days, when I am in a lot of pain, he hurts as well... emotionally... because he can<sq>t make it better.  <br><br>You didn<sq>t write all that much in your OP, but there<sq>s just something niggling in the back of my mind that says your husband is similar to mine in this.  <br><br>So... he is powerless to <dq>fix<dq> you.  That, in and of itself, can be very emasculating.  You are paralyzed from the waist down - I assume that since you need to wear diapers, you probably have little (or no) feeling in your genitals?  So - how WOULD he know if he were hurting you while making love?  <br><br>Also, he may have fear that the vigorous nature of love making could further damage your spine - and neither of you would know it was happening because your nerves are cut off.<br><br>He needs to deal with these fears... and that means finding a therapist who is familiar with working with couples in this situation.  It is likely your physical therapist can refer you to someone.  This is NOT uncommon at all.  <br><br>Also, something to consider - has your husband and your doctor/surgeon spoken **specifically** about sex?  Because that might help as well - he may need to hear, for himself, that it<sq>s ok and what precautions, if any, he needs to be aware of.<br><br>I<sq>ll also mention - I have a disease called [hidradenitis suppurativa](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis_suppurativa).  Trust me, don<sq>t Google it... just stick with the Wiki which doesn<sq>t have pictures.  You don<sq>t want to see the pictures, believe me.  I mention this because, despite this disease, my husband STILL finds me sexy and attractive and we have a healthy sex life.  <br><br>So I don<sq>t think that your husband has lost his attraction OR his love for you.  I think he<sq>s afraid... and therapy will help with that.  </p>",

Further, given that your wife is a smart woman she probably won<sq>t appreciate some Neanderthal alpha-male bullshit. Most women don<sq>t. <br><br>I don<sq>t know your entire situation, but think about this...you do love your wife, right? If so, awesome. Moving forward, given that she loves you as well, think about maybe why she talks to you about things that you might not understand or have interest in. It is likely because it<sq>s something that makes her happy and she<sq>s just telling you about what<sq>s going on in her life. I doubt that she<sq>s trying to just bore you or make you feel inadequate. <br><br>Growing up as the child of parents who had a similar discrepancy in wages and career, I hope my advice helps op. My dad never made as much as my mom and didn<sq>t live the academic life, but he listened to her talk about her interests and what was going on in her life even when he didn<sq>t have a great understanding of what she was talking about. Granted, my mom was maybe a bit bossy like you describe your wife, but I think that<sq>s just part of the package. Sometimes you just have to take time and talk to them about your feelings and be explicitly clear about how they are making you feel. A lot of the time they might not even notice how their bossiness is affecting you. It can be hard, but my parents have been married now for 47 years and they have continued to talk to each other about these issues to this day so that they can both be happy. Hope this helps. </p>",

In comes this monster of a mother/mother-in-law who is refusing to let her own daughter and son-in-law just relax and enjoy their beautiful new home, and make it their own.<br><br>Secondly, you should NOT, under any circumstances, let her use your home as her own. This is setting a bad precedent. She will continue to do so because she got away with it once before. Eventually, she will find a way to try to move in with you both, thus making it officially her home. She will say it<sq>s so big, it<sq>s a mansion, of course you have room for her. Are you going to just let her to avoid her holding a grudge against you? To avoid an adult having a temper tantrum like a toddler? That<sq>s what she is doing.<br><br>Lastly, this is you and your husbands home. Not hers. Your hubby is pissed, and rightly so, because you are letting her steamroll you without thinking of how this is affecting him. How do you think he feels about being kicked out of his home, the home he is trying to build with you, so this crazy woman can pretend she worked hard enough to deserve living there? Shut it all down now. Do not let her decorate, don<sq>t accept her things she buys, do not let her come over unless she is invited, and DO NOT let her have her meeting there. Just say no. If she doesn<sq>t like it, too fucking bad. She is a grown ass woman and should be able to handle not getting her way.<br><br>Did you agree to let her using your home without consulting your hubby first? If you did, you owe him the biggest of apologies. You do not make decisions like that without talking to him and taking his feelings into consideration. He clearly does not want this to happen, therefor it should not happen. Do not justify why you are telling her no, do not blame it on your husband, just tell her <dq>No mom. You cannot pretend my home is yours. You cannot bring people over uninvited. You will not be decorating. If you bring over anything else for My house, I will not be accepting it so make sure you keep the receipt. I am done with this. This is my and husbands home. Not yours. Your input is not needed or wanted. Your presence in my home is based on whether you respect us enough to back off. If you do not, you will not be welcome anymore. If and when I want you here, I will invite you.<dq></p>",

Girls know your game it makes you less attractive because it reeks of low self-confidence. <br><br>While maybe not for all girls, for me the attention doesn<sq>t make me feel special (if you have 6 of these, they wont either) it makes me uncomfortable and guilty that I can<sq>t give them what they want. If it goes on long enough, while maybe still liking the guy as a friend, there might be a little undercurrent of resentment that he wont either man up so i can reject him and be done with it, or move on of his own accord. <br><br>If you want a girlfriend you must stop having this type of <dq>girl friend<dq>. People do end up dating friends sometimes but i doubt it ever happens because one of them was quietly doting on them for years. Treat your female friends exactly as you would your guy friends, if they dont stick around, fuck <sq>em. Don<sq>t modify your personality or humour in any way - if people don<sq>t like it then they aren<sq>t for you. Separate friendship and dating in your head entirely. You are either dating them or they are your friend and there is nothing in between.<br><br>Good luck mate <colon>)</p>",

It helps you realize some things about your food addiction and is quite good. I used his quit smoking book to quit smoking cold turkey after 12 years of a pack a day. The Lose Weight book is quite similar to it (as they are both addictions). Cant hurt to give it a peek anyways.<br><br>also. I also consider myself addicted to food. But i<sq>ve managed to find healthy options. Like instead of french fries and cheeseburgers... stuffed chicken breasts and roasted vegetables. You<sq>re not addicted to food, you<sq>re most like addicted to sugar/carbs (because if you were just addicted to food in general, you would put anything in your mouth, even healthy stuff, but you don<sq>t.

So i wanna give you this tip. As someone that is just starting, doing alot of cardio is going to seem extremely tedious to you. I<sq>m not saying don<sq>t do it, because honestly, its never bad. But my suggestion to you would be to focus primarily on weight training. Build up muscle so that you are burning calories all the time. Cardio only burns calories while you<sq>re doing it. You will lose the weight a hell of a lot faster once you build that muscle.<br><br>And i<sq>d like to give you this program (i<sq>m currently doing it too). http<colon>//www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jamie-easons-livefit-introduction.html<br>Its a 12 week program, primarily based on building muscle (and anyone can do it, size doesn<sq>t matter).

I mean personally I love the malleability of language, yknow? I mean we all have our own ways of using language and I just think it<sq>s fascinating how we either consciously or subconsciously pick and choose elements of it that suit us. So some language you use might be from standard English, some of it might be from the local dialect of where you grew up, some of it you might have come across online or even in a book or whatever... I just think wouldn<sq>t language be so boring if we all used it in exactly the same manner? <br><br>I say all that just because I think there are different ways you could look at text speak and it would be a shame if this guy is otherwise really nice to perhaps lose out on what might be a great relationship just because of him using text speak. So I wonder if it might be worthwhile examining why you have this intense dislike of text speak. Do you have associate it with negative personality traits for example? I know people have suggested elsewhere in the thread that they associate text speak with low intelligence but I don<sq>t think you can judge that from the way somebody writes in casual conversation. It just kind of reminds me of the way people will judge others as being stupid because they have a certain accent or use a certain dialect. If he<sq>s otherwise intelligent (assuming that<sq>s important to you in a partner) could you learn to look past the text speak? There could even be as simple an explanation as he doesn<sq>t like texting and is just trying to shorten it as much as possible (I totally understand that viewpoint, I don<sq>t personally use <sq>u<sq> but sometimes I<sq>m tempted cause I absolutely hate texting haha). </p>",

I know from experience how badly you<sq>re hurting right now and how pissed off you are, but making a quick and clean break from both of them will be healthier for you in the long run.  <br><br>And running away to Europe (if you can do it) isn<sq>t a horrible idea- getting yourself the hell away from her and keeping yourself distracted is probably the best thing you can do right now.  If you<sq>re staying around the area, cut off all contact with her (no emails/FB etc) as soon as you get the practicalities worked out- you<sq>ll get over her faster, and there<sq>s nothing to be gained by staying in touch. <br><br>I<sq>m sorry that it was your friend- that<sq>s so common, but it makes it hurt even more.  I had the same thing happen with a girl who moved in with my fiance and I- she had nowhere else to go so I talked him into letting her live with us for a while until she got on her feet, and they<sq>ve been married now for about 20 years.  That year was not a fun one. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Well, just as I suspected, you<sq>re called an asshole when you already realize your behavior is hurtful and are trying to change. Then you<sq>re told to go to therapy. Welcome to reddit!!<br><br>It IS frustrating when you feel like people can<sq>t understand the simplest thing, especially when you know that person is not stupid. This might get a bit long but I<sq>m going to suggest a few things here<colon> <br><br>1. Your wife is probably very nervous that she<sq>s going to annoy you at this point, and that becomes the focus of her attention, rather than whatever she is supposed to be paying attention to. It<sq>s about mindfulness. When you<sq>re watching a show she<sq>s probably thinking <dq>Shit, I better get all these details right or emptytankl is going to be so annoyed,<dq> instead of just calmly paying attention to the show. The negativity encircling the room because of the expectation of misunderstanding only creates more misunderstanding. <br><br>2. I mentioned this to someone earlier, but you<sq>re letting your reaction control your response. That means you are not being mindful and compassionate (which I think you know). You don<sq>t have to let your reaction control your response; let the reality control the response. So, she reads a magazine, and she doesn<sq>t understand the article and is vocal about that. The reaction<colon> annoyance. The response<colon> eyes rolled, shuts down, tells her she<sq>s not trying hard enough. The reality<colon> You love your wife, she is a good and kind and loving and trustworthy person. You don<sq>t give a flying fuck about the Cosmo article she just read. It<sq>s her you care about. Why not try, when you start to react (annoyed and frustrated) to categorize those thoughts into ones that will cause affliction in your marriage, and ones that won<sq>t. For example<colon> You start to think, <dq>Oh my God she<sq>s an idiot.<dq> <dq>She doesn<sq>t understand anything.<dq> Category<colon> Affliction-causing, negative thoughts. Once you can put them in a category it<sq>s easier to counteract them with positive thoughts<colon> <dq>She<sq>s my wife and cares about me even when I<sq>m shitty and negative to her. She comes to me for understanding because she values my intelligence.<dq> Category<colon> Helpful, non-affliction causing thoughts. This will immediately soften you, making a path for new and wholesome thoughts to come to the forefront, and they can be the thoughts that determine your response to her. You<sq>re not six, you can choose whether your response is drawn from the negative thought reactions, or the reality of the situation.  <br><br>3. When you<sq>ve stopped responding so negatively to your wife, and have come to a place of compassion and understanding, she will probably lose some of the nervousness that is blocking her comprehension of things. The whole atmosphere in your house will be one filled with more ease, and she will probably feel more apt to try harder if she doesn<sq>t think you<sq>re stewing on what an idiot she is. <br><br>4. Gratefulness is one of the most difficult and undervalued states of being in the world. It takes practice, but can start as soon as you wake up in the morning. Try, for one whole day, to be grateful for every little good thing that happens. For the sun shining when you wake up, for the warmth of your bed and your sleeping wife next to you. Be genuinely grateful for the taste of your coffee in the morning-- for the unbelievable journey it took for the coffee beans to get into your house. Be grateful for the job you<sq>re headed to... that you have the ability and health to make money for yourself and your wife. Remind yourself what a miracle it is you don<sq>t live in a poverty-stricken, war-torn country; you can drive freely and without worry there<sq>s a roadside bomb around the corner. I know all of this seems crunchy as shit and a bit over-zealous, but all of this stuff really is worth being grateful for. It<sq>ll make it easier when you come home to be grateful for the moments you have with your wife, because they are not guaranteed. Anything could happen at any moment that changes the situations you<sq>re in; remembering that will help you remember how fleeting life is and how worthy your loving wife is of your gratefulness and respect.<br><br>Okay I<sq>m gonna shut up now because this is getting long, but I<sq>d suggest you should read a book on mindfulness, or even take a course on it. You already have a good perspective on it, you just need some guidance about how to put it into practice. Practice being the key word here. This stuff doesn<sq>t just magically happen because you want it to.

I basically end up seeing things differently and ask questions to comprehend a concept better. Sometimes I ask questions to rule ideas out. I do this to understand whatever is going on better. Many times I ask the same question twice because it hasn<sq>t sunken in my head or I immediately forgot what was said. <br><br>Perhaps your wife is like me, a million things/ideas are running through her head and it could be hard to focus on 1 thing. I<sq>ve noticed that many times when I<sq>m discussing something with my fiance, during the discussion, another idea, question, or topic will come to mind and I am trying my hardest to hold that other thought to incorporate into the discussion or bring up the other topics later. <br><br>So yea, perhaps she<sq>s Dyslexic like me. Do not worry, this does not mean she<sq>s stupid, if anything, it just means that she has to learn/comprehend differently than most. Many people with this disability, are extremely intelligent once they learn on how to work with their learning disability. There are famous people with this disability<colon> Einstein, Pablo Picasso, Richard Branson, and Steven Spielberg. <br><br>What can you do? Research dyslexia. Approach your wife with compassion and have her check it out if she can relate to the symptoms listed for dyslexia, which she will from what you<sq>re describing. You also need to be patient, loving, and provide kindness. This is what I am most grateful for. My fiance and I have been together for almost 5 years. I love him to death and am thankful for his patience. In the beginning of our relationship, he was frustrated with me like you were. But once I explained to him about my Dyslexia and how my brain works, he went out of his way to learn about it and saw it first hand how I struggle sometimes. He is amazed on how my brain works and how intelligent I actually am because of my learning disability. I have to work/study harder for everything. <br><br>Look into it. Good luck and remember, we all have flaws. Be grateful that you have someone loving that is accepting of yours. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I think people are over-reacting here, because there<sq>s alot of information that is unknown to us.<br><br>My wife used to take Unisom.  It would cause her to fall asleep, but she also sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and did weird things, and then didn<sq>t remember.  One time she got up, put on a bathrobe, walked out into the kitchen, and started trying to fry some frozen vegetables on a frying pan without taking them out of the package.  Another time, she got up naked and walked down to the parking structure, got into her car, and fell asleep behind the wheel.  In both cases, she had absolutely zero recollection of doing any of those things.  My point is, it<sq>s entirely possible that your husband came over and started kissing you or caressing you, and you were responsive, so he started having sex with you.  You could have then fallen asleep during sex, and woken up without remembering the beginning of it.  Just because you *think* you didn<sq>t give consent doesn<sq>t mean you were raped.  And that<sq>s where this whole thing gets murky.  A super drunk girl at a party might start making out with a guy, and she might initiate sex with him, but if she<sq>s dead drunk and he<sq>s sober, what he<sq>s doing is technically rape because a dead drunk person can<sq>t legally give consent.  However, if that guy is her husband, then he might have reasonable reason to believe that her making out with him in conjunction with him being her husband, especially if he<sq>s not aware that she isn<sq>t fully sober or awake, it could easily meet the legal definition of consent.<br><br>So, before you divorce your husband, why don<sq>t you have a talk with him and see if the two of you can figure out what happened.  Also, set rules for the future, because he may not be aware that you wold feel violated and raped in that instance.</p>",

If she means that she would leave if you told her to go without it being a joint decision, then I could probably live with that.  If she means that she<sq>s unilaterally choosing her needs and desires over yours, then that<sq>s a problem.<br><br>Let<sq>s give your wife the benefit of the doubt and say that, all else being equal, she wouldn<sq>t hesitate to put her husband and marriage first.  And that the reason she<sq>s not doing that here, is because she does NOT see things being equal.  She sees that her friend is in a much harder spot than you are right now.  Her needs are greater, and emotionally she is much more alone (single mom with no family around?  that<sq>s hard man) than you are.  While it can definitely be a pisser, this type of triaging of resources based on needs is generally a great trait to have in the mother of your children.  Try not to be *too* mad about it!  If you can!<br><br>As for what to do about it, there are a few things to do, but if you<sq>ve already been threatened with divorce then I<sq>m going to assume you need to take about 12 steps back and reconnect with your spouse before you do anything even remotely <dq>fix the problem<dq>-esque.  <br><br>1.  Just start off with something super blunt and straightforward.  Get the friend to babysit for a night and invite your wife out to a date.  Get a hotel or a show or whatever, but when you<sq>re inviting her say something along the lines of <dq>I<sq>ve been wanting to take some time for just the 2 of us to reconnect.  It isn<sq>t specifically about work stress, Friend, her kid or ours or anything, I just feel like we<sq>ve had some conflict and I want to pay for a hotel room and spend the night holding you in a bed that neither one of us had to wash the sheets for.<dq>  <br><br>2.  On a different night, try to schedule some kid/interruption free time to bring up the Friend issue, and start off with something like <dq>I know we agree she could live with us until she found her feet, but it has gotten through my thick skull that you<sq>re seeing a lack of footing that I just don<sq>t see.  I think we had different understandings of what the ending parameters of this arrangement were.  I<sq>m feeling anxious and frustrated because from my point of view, we already passed the finish line.  And because this is still going, that means there is, literally, no end in sight.  Do you see us as not yet having reached the <dq>back on her feet<dq> mark?  Or did things change slowly over time and I wasn<sq>t told?<br><br>The primary goal of this conversation should be for you to better understand what is going on in your wife<sq>s head when she<sq>s making her decisions.  I<sq>m betting that she hasn<sq>t actually chosen her friend over you, that she<sq>s just trying to be altruistic, but there<sq>s always the possibility that this convo goes bad.  If that<sq>s the case, this is not the conversation to start an argument about it.  You<sq>re literally just here to listen and mirror and try to understand.  If you get an answer like <dq>actually we<sq>ve been lovers since she moved in and I<sq>m divorcing you and taking the kids, the house, and all your money<dq> feel free to blow a gasket.  If it<sq>s less-bad than that, try to stifle until she starts asking you questions.<br><br>3.  I don<sq>t know how much emotional energy night 2 will take, but the third step (might need to be on a different night) is for you to invite (even pressure if you need to) her to better understand how much you<sq>re not doing well with the current situation.  If she<sq>s thinking <dq>me and my husband are so fucking 150<percent> rock solid stable, he<sq>s my SuperMan, and there<sq>s literally nothing he can<sq>t do or endure (that<sq>s all pretty cool, right?) that I can subject my home, family, and marriage to a multi-year long source of stress and there won<sq>t be even a tiny bit of damage done.  (that would be cool if it were true, but... it<sq>s not.)  She needs to know that you are not in a place where you<sq>re 100<percent> and the friend is at 50<percent> and therefore it is fine if she takes from you and gives to Friend.  Let her know that you<sq>re not doing well right now, and it<sq>s getting slowly worse.  That you<sq>re drained.  You<sq>re frustrated.  You<sq>re anxious about the speed at which you<sq>re being drained, because when there<sq>s no end in sight, you have no way of knowing if you<sq>re going to be sucked dry and lose your self.  Let her know that because she has threatened to leave you, that you no longer feel like you have control over your own life, home, family, marriage.  And that if she is <dq>to the point where she<sq>s threatened to leave me if I tell her best friend to go<dq> that you don<sq>t think it will come to that, because it will be unlikely that she would still have a husband by then.  I don<sq>t know your wife, maybe she genuinely thinks that a marriage means that <dq>well, since we<sq>re together forever, now I don<sq>t have to worry about maintaining that bond at all and I can pull and yank and abuse it so as to help everyone that my altruistic tendencies drive me to.<dq>  </p>",

(i can appreciate some people are uncomfortable with full sex during a period and that<sq>s fine, as long as you aren<sq>t made to feel like a leper!)<br><br>I don<sq>t know how you can convince someone that they enjoy sex/ intercourse too, it may just be that oral sex is much higher up the list for him than for you, but if there is no other way to get through to him i would request oral sex (when you don<sq>t have your period) rather than having sex.   If the sex is all about pleasing you this would seem logical, then you reciprocate with oral sex for him, when he wants it.   <br><br>mainly i really think you need to take a stand on this issue and tell him he has made you feel bad about sex, and oral sex - something which should be pleasurable to you both, not a chore and explain how you expect to be treated, i.e. with love and respect at all times, as you treat him.  <br><br>No-one should ever make you feel used or make you feel like you can<sq>t say no to sex (oral or otherwise) if you are tired or unwell.  A considerate partner would get you some painkillers and a hotwater bottle if you had bad cramps, and tell you put your feet up, not guilt you into giving him a blowjob!!  <br><br>Until he understands this and starts treating you with respect i would not have any intimate contact with him.  If he throws a tantrum let him.  He is a grown adult but if he behaves like a child then treat him like one, don<sq>t give in to bad behavior as it only reinforces and makes him see all he has to do to get what he wants is make your life difficult and throw a tantrum.  Stay cool and calm and tell him when he calms down you will talk and that tantrums don<sq>t work.  Keep repeating your point and stop giving into something just to avoid a fight, if he causes a fight you don<sq>t need to take part in it, just ignore him until he calms down - giving in will just make it worse. Stay calm and keep telling him how you want and expect to be treated and keep repeating it, for weeks if necessary until he understands and stops behaving in such a selfish and horrible way.  <br><br>Apologies if i have jumped to any incorrect assumptions, but its just so sad and unpleasant that you are being treated like this, a relationship is meant to be a safe place where you feel loved and cared for, not used and gross.  Obviously you love this person so hopefully you will manage to get through to him.  I wish you good luck and hope you resolve this before it poisons your relationship.</p>",

That<sq>s not how parents take care of their kids, parents want their kids to be secure feeling and not have to worry about adult problems like this. It<sq>s damaging and stressful and I bet you could really use someone to talk to and give you some advice.

                "answer": "<p>I have done this. It was the best thing I<sq>ve ever done. But also the hardest thing -- and its had lasting repuercussions. There are parts of life I have missed out of because I did this, and relationships, outside of my parents, that have been damaged because of this. I would do it over in a heartbeat. I will tell you about my experiences and feel free to ask questions. <br><br>I grew up in an abusive home. I was called names like slut and whore from as early as I can remember (at least 3 years old). My father would watch porn and masturbate when Iw as in the room. Etc. Etc. (I don<sq>t mind talking about details, but right now, I want to focus on the letter). Growing up, I tried really hard to be a good kid, to do well in school and just be <dq>better<dq> because I thought then everything would be ok, and I would be loved. My first relationship was abusive -- I followed the pattern. I self injured. It was a very dark time in my life.<br><br>At one point, I realized I had hit as low as I wanted to go -- any further and Iw as scared of what would happen. I was in my early 20s, living on my own. I had just managed to end the abusive relationship, but I was still cuttig. I had dropped out of university, and pushed most of my friends away. A friend of mine had been murdered not long prior. I knew I needed help, but didn<sq>t know how to ask for it -- so I went to therapy. I went for a few years. I needed to, I still go sometimes now when I feel like I need to check in with myself.<br><br>The therapist recommended for a long time that I write a letter to my parents, but for a long time I refused. I just wasn<sq>t ready (and this is important, you need to be ready). I did the same things, I would screen my calls. I would never just answer in case it was my parents. When they came to town (which was rare), I would have panic attacks leading up to the visits. I choked at dinner once because my anxiety was so strong my throat felt like it was closing. My mom was embarrassed. Their last visit, after they left, I sat on the floor in the corner of my room and I disassociated so badly that I lost three hours. I have no memory of that time passing.<br><br>One day, I decided I was ready and I sat down and I wrote and I wrote. I wrote about all the things that they had done, about how it had made me feel. I wrote about how ithas affected me as an adult, how it has affected me in my ability to have a healthy relationship. I told them about how I was eating ramen noodles so I could afford therapy, because of the things I experienced. I also told htem that if they wanted to have a relationship with me in the future it would be on my terms -- it would be an HONEST relationship where we didn<sq>t hide what had happened. I was willing to move forward but not if it meant keeping secrets still. The letter sat on my side table for a week before I was ready to post it. My friends walked me to the post office box, and i cried the entire way there. I dropped that letter in and felt a huge weight -- whatever happened, was going to happen, there was no way to get it back.<br><br>I have never heard back from my parents. I knew this was a strong possibility, and I was not surprised.<br><br>One thign I did before I sent this letter, was I reached out to an aunt. My mom<sq>s sister. My father was the abusive one more often than not, and I know he<sq>s controlling of my mom. On some level I wanted her to have a support network, so I emailed the letter to my aunt before I sent it and just said something to the lines of <dq>I know this will be painful for you to hear, but I feel my mom needs support. I apologize for having to share this with you, and ask that you handle this with discretion.<dq><br><br>My aunt called me in tears and apologized -- she told me of all sorts of <dq>signs<dq> she had noticed when I was growing up (we only saw her about once a year). She told me she used to question my mom on things but always let it go. By being honest with my aunt, I learned to really trust her. And, even though I know what I experienced, having someone bring up details that they saw made me feel...reassured, if that makes sense? On some level I would start to doubt myself and tell myself I needed to suck it up. But hearing her stories made me know I made the right decision.<br><br>I have felt stronger since sending the letter. It didn<sq>t happen all at once, but by standing up for myself, for the first time in my life, I suddnely started to feel that I had control. I grew so much in the next few years -- and I learned so much about  who I was. I still struggle with being able to voice opinions and preferences. I grew up trying to figure out whateveryone else wanted as a way to keep the peace. So, I suddenly found myself as an adult who had no clue what her f avorite food was, colour, or movie. I hadn<sq>t been allowed to have one before.<br><br>I<sq>ve been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and PTSD. Sending that letter WAS the right thing for me, and it was a turning point in my growth.<br><br>BUT. I now have no relationship with my parents. None. I ahven<sq>t spoken to them in about 8 years. I<sq>ve lost my relationship with my brother -- who isn<sq>t willing to talk about the past. Sending the letter was so hard that I wasn<sq>t ready to talk to exxtended family, and as such, many of them harbour hurt feelings and see me as a <dq>black sheep<dq> who moved away and didn<sq>t bother to keep in touch. I<sq>ve hurt my grandfather immensely because I cut ties to my parents. I never told him why. I figured he<sq>s in his 80s, so it seems inappropriate to talk of what his daughter and husband did to me. Eight years later, and I<sq>m finally trying to work up the nerve to face him and the pain I<sq>ve caused him.<br><br>For many years, holidays were really, really hard. they still are, but I<sq>ve managed to build new memories. But I spent many years isolating myself around christmas or thanksgiving because it felt painfully raw. I<sq>m not good at accepting support from friends and loved ones, because I<sq>ve always had to stand on my own two feet. Being independent has been very REAL for me, because there is no back up plan. Ic an<sq>t ever go to my parents for a short term loan, or a place to stay.<br><br>Its been a very, very difficult path to take. But I would do it again without a second thought. There is no way I would have made it to where I am today without taking that step. I was a scared kid, university drop out, torn into knots of anxiety, cutting myself with self hatred and on a slow spiral downhill trip.<br><br>Now, I<sq>m 33 years old, I own my own condo, until I got laid off a few months ago, I had a good paying, career. I<sq>m engaged to a wonderful man, who was willing to hold me when I cried at being touched gently for the first time. I<sq>ve been accepted into his family with open arms and true love. I<sq>ve attained so much more than I ever thought I could have, and that letter was one of the turning points in which I said <dq>I<sq>m worth more, I<sq>m worth honesty, and I can take control.<dq><br><br>Actually, I<sq>m really glad I wrote out that last paragraph, I<sq>ve been feeling a bit depressed today, being unemployed has been getting to me, but really, I<sq>m so lucky.<br><br>I don<sq>t know if writing the letter is right for you. You will know if you<sq>re ready for it. Know it won<sq>t be easy if you do. There will be a lot of pain. think about what YOUR terms are -- what do you need to have an honest relationship, and then don<sq>t compromise, you<sq>re worth more.</p>",

For god<sq>s sake, his brain isn<sq>t even close to being done growing yet - he<sq>s got another five to seven years left. He<sq>s had no adult education (college, university, etc.). He has no history with past relationships to help guide him on handling his emotions, sex, jealousy, etc. Instead of learning with a peer, he<sq>s being molded by someone who already knows how this stuff works and has all the tools to take psychological, emotional, and physical advantage of him.

Her parents? Her coworkers? Does she truly want to integrate this kid into her life longterm? How on earth does she see that working out? <br><br>You, as this minor child<sq>s parents, need to have a very serious discussion with this woman. Your job is to protect your son, and if I were you, I would instantly mistrust someone of her age and status (teacher) entering into a romantic relationship with a 16-year-old.

It<sq>s still not safe to be <sq>outed<sq> as a gay man in today<sq>s society unless you<sq>re from very specific locations and communities. Even the LGBT communities perpetuate their own stereotypes. It makes it hard for everyone, and I can guarantee that those men who are constantly bombarding each other for sexual fulfillment are not having all their needs met either. I<sq>m sure it<sq>s a very lonely feeling, but you are not the only one like this. I hope your therapist can help you to gain some self confidence even when you<sq>re fighting the daily fight of stereotypes and hatred that surround those communities.<br><br>I think you would benefit a lot (like many others) from pursuing hobbies and communities that are in line with your own interests. If you<sq>re an artist, join classes and clubs around your city. If you<sq>re really into volunteering your time, volunteer your time with a charity or other organization. Once you find straight or gay friends who are true friends, I think it might be easier on you when dating. I<sq>m not sure what your friend situation is, but friends should be helping you with your dating life. <br><br>I also have to suggest /r/r4r on here. I have met a lot of people, and quite a few have turned into close friends. Try to be as honest as you can in your post about what you<sq>re looking for, and make sure to post some fun interesting things. Even if you find someone 1000 miles away, it may help to know there is an honest soul out there that finds you worthy of their time...and attractive.<br><br>In the future, don<sq>t engage with people who send up red flags. There is no excuse for gay men (or anyone) to treat you or others with disrespect. Even if you are going to have a one night stand, it can be done with mutual respect. Also, if one night stands or flings are hurting your self confidence and overall mental health you should probably back off.<br><br><br>> I occasionally make a grindr profile in which I utilize images of random \u201carchetypal attractive\u201d white males and am shocked at how quickly people will throw caution to the wind for a night with a pretty face and muscular body. Profiles that expressly state that they are looking for platonic relationships respond exclusively to men with whom they want to sleep. When I meet people who are willing to engage in a conversation with me once I use the veil of a \u201cpretty\u201d person, I often become so angry that I get them to meet \u201cme\u201d somewhere late at night and then stand them up. The same with making men come meet up with fake person who state that they have boyfriends or are not looking for sex. I get to make liars of them. It all makes me feel incredibly powerful, however briefly.<br><br>This is not good for you at all. Yes, there are people who want to find a gorgeous man/woman to have amazing sex with for one night. That is OKAY. There are people who will lie through their teeth to have sex with someone, and that<sq>s not okay. I<sq>m glad you have the ability to recognize when it happens. Yes, there are people in the world who don<sq>t want what you want...there are a whole barrel full. That<sq>s okay too! The one thing you<sq>ll have to accept as a grown man is that people can be fucking ridiculous to you. It<sq>s sucks, but it<sq>s also normal. There are also a lot of men who are just like you. Maybe they aren<sq>t waving giant signs over their heads, but that<sq>s why we really have to dig to find someone that<sq>s a good fit when dating. Everyone has to do it, and everyone has different levels of difficulty they have to overcome. <br><br>My advice<colon><br><br>1. Pursue things you love. A man who loves those things will come along and you<sq>ll connect, be it as friends or lovers. <br><br>2. Don<sq>t give in to hatred. It<sq>s important to recognize where shallow and selfish behavior comes from, and accept that others aren<sq>t always as strong as you are. It<sq>s also important to realize that if two people are pursuing gorgeous people for sex only, that<sq>s a valid choice. It may make them happy or it may make them miserable. It<sq>s their choice, and you don<sq>t have to do that to find happiness. Keep your ideals and goals, because that<sq>s where the interesting bits are at. <br><br>3. Continued Counseling. Definitely keep this up. The more you are equipped to deal with life<sq>s situations, the less stressful things will be and the more fun you will have. <br><br><br>Glad you got to get things off your chest. I hope you find some peace and a sweet boyfriend in the near future. =)</p>",

Lying on dating sites and luring people out under false pretenses is not less shallow and manipulative than rejecting people based on their appearance. <br><br>It sounds like you are equating gay people with the gay <sq>scene<sq>. I understand your frustrations. As a lesbian, it<sq>s frustrating that the LGTB scene usually means the gay men scene, except on occasional <dq>lesbian themes nights<dq>. In my city there are easily half a dozen gay bars, and zero lesbian bars, and every time I go to a gay bar, I<sq>m just not into the vibe. However, straight clubs are a meat market too. That<sq>s kind of the point. You can go to gay bars and be surrounded by sleazy gay guys trying to pick up other guys, or you can go to a straight bar and be surrounded by sleazy straight guys and sleazy straight women trying to pick up each other. You<sq>ll hear the same complaints from anyone who is going to bars looking for serious relationships. These aren<sq>t the places where most long-term monogamous couples go to hang out, and if they are there, they are probably their to dance with friends and mind their own business. <br><br>If you want to move past the shallow culture and experience deeper relationships, then stop being so damn shallow. What about you besides your appearance makes you interesting? What things do you enjoy doing, what are your interests? If you choose to spend your free time creating fake profiles, maybe the issue is that you aren<sq>t very attractive to people who have deeper interests, because they want a person who is more interested in pursuing their own interests and passions than obsessing over what they don<sq>t like about everyone else. People are attracted to positivity. Start by the exemplifying the qualities you look for in a relationship, and then start surrounding yourself with the types of people that embody those qualities, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. That<sq>s how you build a community to meet like-minded people.</p>",

I wasn<sq>t married, had been with my boyfriend for less than a year (we celebrated 14 years in June) and we weren<sq>t trying for a baby.   My bff at the time had been married for a couple years at that point and they had been trying to have a baby pretty much since the wedding night. They had no trouble getting pregnant,  it was the staying pregnant that was the problem.  She ended up having several miscarriages...including one just a month or so before I found out I was pregnant.  <br><br>I talked to my mom about it because she had had a miscarriage and secondary infertility before having my brother.  She said the best thing to do would be to tell her myself before anyone else could tell her. We live in a small town and she was close with my family.  And to let her lead how much she wanted to be involved. <br><br>My boyfriend and I ended up going to their house that evening after they got home from work.  I told her I had something to tell her and showed her the pregnancy test.  She smacked my shoulder and said <dq>I hate you!<dq> I could tell she was hurting, but I knew that she didn<sq>t really mean that she hated me. Her husband didn<sq>t say much of anything.  But I could see that he was watching his wife very closely to make sure that she was okay. Now she doesn<sq>t remember slapping me or telling me that she hated me. LOL But she said she was grateful that she heard the news from me and not my aunt at work. (Which happened...my aunt that worked with her husband told him as soon as she found out. )<br><br>She was there when I gave birth and was one of the first to hold my son. And she cried. She cried even more when we asked her and her husband to be godparents. My son calls them <dq>aunt<dq> and <dq>uncle<dq>. And about a month before my sons first birthday she gave birth to my first nephew.  We are his godparents, too. She went on to have a total of 3 kids. <br><br>Now not everyone is going to ne as forgiving as my friend,  but hopefully your sister will understand that you didn<sq>t do this on purpose or with any malice. Your getting pregnant was not meant to make her feel bad. I do hope that you can enjoy this pregnancy!  Becoming a momma is the best thing I ever did in my life. If you have any questions or need any help, feel free to message me. Good luck and congratulations!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m going to take both your sides here and I hope you read it and sincerely think about my points. I<sq>ve been a vegetarian (leaning vegan) for over 11 years. I grew up on a farm, have a lot of first-hand experience caring for and raising and even helping butcher and process animals, and I have done a good bit of research on our current food system and how animals are raised and treated.<br><br>I personally believe that our current factory farm system of getting meat and animal products is fucked up beyond belief, and absolutely, completely, morally wrong. If you have not researched it yourself, then I would encourage you to do so. Animals are bred to be absolute monstrosities to get more meat, they are crammed into terrible small painful cages, they are stuffed full of antibiotics to keep them alive because they are in such nasty dirty cramped conditions that otherwise they<sq>d all get diseases and die, and they are often physically mistreated and killed in awful ways. As far as we know, no animals are as smart as humans, but they do have varying levels of intelligence, and most scientists agree they can feel pain and fear and care for each other. Given that, I think what we are doing to sentient, feeling beings is really messed up. Your girlfriend probably feels similarly. She sees a very awful thing happening in the world, and it makes her very sad, and to see someone she loves being part of that system of torture and mistreatment is difficult for her.<br><br>THAT SAID, I would urge you to weigh carefully if she is the type to pull this kind of ultimatum-like behavior on other topics. Is this the ONE thing that trips her trigger to the point of practically being a deal-breaker? Or, if you capitulate on this one thing, is she going to push on other things? Is it always going to be her way or the highway? Is she incapable of respecting other people<sq>s moral choices in other ways, or is this the only thing where she absolutely sees in black and white? How does she behave toward people she disagrees with on other topics?<br><br>Could you possibly compromise with her that you will only buy meat/animal products from local farmers who actually treat their animals well (until killing them)? For example, I buy goat cheese from a local no-kill goat rescue, and I think most vegans (even if they didn<sq>t want to eat the cheese) would be okay with that.<br><br>Please consider the entire situation. Do some research on animal products. I don<sq>t think you should feel forced into going vegan. I certainly do not insist that my partners be vegan or vegetarian. And I don<sq>t love her way of going about this. For example, with my husband, I was totally fine with him eating meat anytime, as long as he didn<sq>t make me prepare it or pay for it. He gradually ate less and less meat, and ended up having some positive health benefits because of it, and then did some research on the animal industry, and now he hasn<sq>t eaten meat in almost a year. Do I demand that of him? Absolutely not. But I do really appreciate that he didn<sq>t pressure me to eat meat, that he almost never brought meat home into the house and instead ate it when we went out, and that he was open enough to examine the subject on his own.<br><br>Anyway, I hope you can find a path that makes you happy, whatever it is, with or without her, with or without eating meat. Best wishes.</p>",

Exchange local Spanish group for taking the bus to work and home together and the man falls into the same place.  The courtship, lack of sexual advances--though there was other physical connections--and lack of emotion when I tried to save it.  <br><br>I too tried to get her to go to counseling.  And, she did, for one session and clearly it was mostly for me.  She was never open with her feelings, as evidenced by her shocking me with her feelings that she hadn<sq>t expressed to me...ever...until she was already ready to leave, so counseling didn<sq>t work.  It didn<sq>t make things better or worse but it ultimately didn<sq>t help.  <br><br>The long story short is that there<sq>s not much you can do.  It sucks.  I mean it heart wrenchingly, there goes my life as I know it and what am I supposed to do now, sucks.  I hate even having to say it because my chest hurts just thinking about someone else going through the same thing(s) I<sq>ve been going through for the past year.  But, based on what you<sq>ve said, and based on my own experiences that echo a lot of what you<sq>ve said, she<sq>s already moved on.  How?  You<sq>re caught off guard, but she isn<sq>t.  She has already started to move on and the last part for her is telling you that she<sq>s doing so.  The counseling isn<sq>t for you two to work it out, it<sq>s so she doesn<sq>t feel so bad as she<sq>s leaving you.  The unfortunate part is that you now have to figure out how to move on yourself.  And, that<sq>s simply not going to happen over night.  Sleeping in the bed by myself, coming home to an empty house, having to figure out how to pay the bills all by myself (yeah she left completely--financially, emotionally and physically), and reconstruct myself with a life that I could feel good about was--and continues to be--very very hard.  But, I keep putting one foot in front of the other.  Some days are good, some days are bad.  But, you will find your strength again.  You will find that you have a heart that will be stronger than it ever was before and eventually you<sq>ll find some other love that will be greater than what you<sq>ve already known.  <br><br>With that said, be on your toes and start preparing for the divorce she was already for when she decided to finally tell you she was moving on.  Document her indiscretions, be fair and courteous and patient...be the better person.  Not because it will get you any imaginary points or awards, but because you are.  Don<sq>t be petty, don<sq>t say or do anything rash or hurtful, and take care of yourself.  <br><br>I<sq>m really sorry to read this because it hurts reading something that is so eerily familiar to what I<sq>ve been going through, but you have to start trying to move on.  And, you will.  It won<sq>t happen overnight but you will nonetheless.  </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Okay, I<sq>ve read some of the comments you<sq>ve made in this thread and a picture is starting to develop. First - it really does seem that you have already made up your mind about this, if you have - you just need to follow through and deal with whatever consequences (good or bad) that come, because no one on reddit can predict the future events of your life. It seems to me, that you<sq>re looking for someone to tell you that it will all work itself out, and to alleviate the guilt you feel over this decision. I am not saying you SHOULD feel guilty about thinking to leave her, these are thoughts everyone in a serious relationship has from time to time, but often times when we do feel guilt - there is a good reason. Guilt should not be lessened, it should be examined and inspected for validity - and than felt passionately until self-forgiveness is achieved.  You may be bored, but if you feel so guilty about leaving her that you<sq>re searching for reddit to pat you on the back and tell you it<sq>s going to be okay - maybe you love her? You don<sq>t want to hurt her. You just want the quality of your relationship to improve.<br><br>Which leads me into<colon> society of broken toys. In this day and age, if a toy breaks - we get a new one. When my grandmother was a child, if her toy broke - she fixed it. This is entirely comparable to how we treat our relationships. We start to get bored, the <dq>magic<dq> or the <dq>spark<dq> in the honeymoon phase starts to fade out and we think .... hey, I wan<sq>t that back! I should find a new partner! Which leaves us with a high divorce rate, and eternal bachelors. No - if something is broken, you attempt to fix it. Especially when a human heart is on the line. You need some space? Than ask for it. Have you communicated any of these feelings to your partner? Does she know that you are having second thoughts - maybe if she did, she would put more effort into giving you what you need. Hell, maybe you<sq>ll find that she feels the same way and you can both take some me-time. Second<colon> spending more time together is not always the answer - although it<sq>s what you<sq>ll hear most often. No - It is not the quantity of time you spend together, it is the quality of that time. People seem to equate <dq>being in the same room<dq> as <dq>spending time together<dq> - that is not true. Watching T.V on the couch may seem like couples time.... but you<sq>re not engaged in one another<sq>s company when you are staring at a screen. Do you still go out on dates? To dinner. For picnics? Hikes in the woods? Do you go out dancing? Do you engage in mutual interests - or attempt to take interest in one of her hobbies/activities (and likewise - does she do that for you?). Do you have open and honest communication about your needs/wants/desires? Have you told her about any fetishes or sexual fantasies that you may want to play out? Have you been open about who you are and what you want - and has she done ALL of this in return? If not - you haven<sq>t been fixing your toys.... you<sq>ve been bashing them against a wall until it was broken into little pieces. No wonder you<sq>re looking to get a new one.<br><br>Work on fixing it first, especially if you feel guilt towards leaving her. If you ever want that feeling of <dq>should I do this?<dq> (or - <dq>Should I have done that?<dq>) to go away - than you need to put every effort into double checking that YOU are not the problem in your relationship. You need to double check that it can<sq>t be fixed. IF - after putting effort and hard work into your relationship, you find that it<sq>s still not working - Than you will feel no guilt and have no regrets about breaking off the relationship, and it will most likely (but not always) be mutual... especially if you have open and honest communication throughout the process.<br><br>However - if you have indeed already made up your mind to leave, than nothing that can be said here will change that. All I can do is leave you with a warning<colon> When you find the <dq>perfect<dq> relationship that you seem to desire - it will not stay perfect forever. You will be happy throughout; but you will get bored, you will need space, and you will be distracted. The fairy tale of two people becoming one and living happily ever after is a thing of the past - it worked than, because couples understood that love takes patience, strength, and an ability to fix something when it breaks. Now that we no longer instinctively have that ability - we need to learn it, for our relationships to work. Even if the girl you<sq>re with is not <dq>the one<dq> - you<sq>ve proven yourself to prefer the flight tactic; when confronted with fight or flight. If you ever want a relationship to be that dazzling thing you envision - you<sq>ll need to learn to fight for it.<br><br>I wish you the best of luck in creating your happiness. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m irritated by the replies from people simplifying this into <dq>you<sq>re gay.<dq>  Sexuality is usually considered to be a [spectrum](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale) (0-6 sort of thing with 0 being exclusively straight, 6 being exclusively gay), and what you identify as is how *you* personally identify yourself.  A person that has a sexuality spectrum 2 or 3 can still identify as straight.  A person with a sexuality spectrum of 4 or 5 can still identify as gay.  It doesn<sq>t matter.  It<sq>s called sexual *preference*, not sexual *absolutes.*<br><br>Unfortunately, a lot of people (see; MANY) think in terms of absolutes.  That<sq>s why there are people who can<sq>t even wrap their minds around the idea of someone being truly bisexual.  These people usually over-simplify things with such statements as <dq>Well you had sex with a guy so you<sq>re automatically gay.  It doesn<sq>t matter that you were in a committed relationship with a woman you loved for the last 3 years, you<sq>re just gay now.<dq><br><br>You<sq>re not gay.  You had sex with a man, so you<sq>re probably not a 0 on the sexuality spectrum, but this doesn<sq>t make you OMG GAY FOR SUREZ.<br><br>It sounds like your girlfriend liked the fantasy of the MMF more than the reality.  This isn<sq>t uncommon, and it means that she was ill-prepared to deal with the emotional and mental consequences of partaking in the threesome to start with.  She probably didn<sq>t *intentionally* set you up, but it was likely one of those situations where she only realized afterwards that it wasn<sq>t something she wanted, and it being too late to take it back - she decided to place her frustration about it upon you.  Who knows what she<sq>s said to her friends, but the point is that this isn<sq>t your fault.  You didn<sq>t make a <dq>mistake<dq> - she did.  If she wasn<sq>t mentally and emotionally prepared to watch you have sex with another person, another *man* - she shouldn<sq>t have pressured you into it.  <br><br>Fuck her (not literally) - you can find an *adult* that knows the difference between fantasy and reality; someone who will have the ability to recognize when a problem is *her* fault.<br></p>",

I<sq>m sorry you didn<sq>t get to be there for your daughter. But, try not to let the anger at her mother fester. She was probably just as confused as you were when you were young and she made a decision that she maybe didn<sq>t know how to get out of. I don<sq>t think that what she did was right, by any means, but I think if you don<sq>t let that anger go, your daughter will sense it. She was her mother, and her world and because of that, you need to learn to forgive. Your daughter will sense otherwise.<br><br>With the maternal grandparents I<sq>d be open and honest with them. Are they good people? They<sq>ve lost a daughter and they may be very scared they<sq>re about to lose a grandchild. If you feel you can trust them I<sq>d put my heart on my sleeve and be honest -- you<sq>re shocked, scared shitless, not sure what to do but above all you want to make things right and you want to give your daughter the best life she can have -- let them know that. And let them know that you always see them as a part of her life and her stability.A child can not have too much love in their life.<br><br>For your family, I do<sq>nt know what I would do in this situation. Its not a win-win at all. If you wait, your family<sq>s feelings may be hurt, if you tell and they do not respect your request not to act then you could be hurt. Are you closer to one of your siblings? Why not start with talking to just one of them? Regardless, when you do talk to them, you need to step outside of what ever familial role you<sq>ev had with them. You are not speaking to them as their child, but as a man with a child to protect himself. I<sq>d be as clear as you can about what you need (their support and patience, and time) and what their role is. Make it clear that you need space to get to know your daughter and that, given    that her life has just been turned upside down, its important to not overwhelm her.<br><br>If I had to give advice on how people meet the first time? Do it on her ground. Do it at the maternal grandparents<sq> -- let her feel as safe as she can by being in a familiar place, with familiar people around (her maternal grandparents) and with no expectations. Hugs are not mandatory, nor is showing off artwork or school work or demonstrating piano skills.<br><br>Get your ass to a counsellor of some sort -- you<sq>re going to be going through a lot and you need an outlet. Even if its just a place where you feel safe to cry -- and that<sq>s ok, you<sq>re going to be mourning the loss of someone you remembered, the loss of the early years of your child, and the loss of your life as you knew it. You may even begrudge having a child for moments in this whole process (face it, there<sq>s been no chance for you to get used to the idea and prepare yourself) and I think its important to have someone there who reassures you that its normal, its ok and gives you advice on how to go through this process.<br><br>It may also be good for your daughter to see someone.<br><br>As for being a good father? No one really knows how to do this, and the only way to know you<sq>ve done a good job is kind of when they<sq>re all grown up and you see them on their own. Do your best to always put her needs and interests first. ALways let her know you love her and praise her when she does well or is discouraged -- but let her know that sometimes, she<sq>s going to fail -- and that<sq>s ok. Listen to her, be her friend and give her boundaries. The next little while is going to be scary for her -- so always keep her around people who love her.<br><br>This is getting long, but I<dq>m sure people here will give you great advice. Take it all one day at a time.<br><br>And when you tell her? I<sq>d probably go the honest route, if you<sq>re dishonest she<sq>ll find out one day and doubt you. <dq>Honey, I<sq>m so sorry Iwasn<sq>t there for you. I will regret taht every day of my life. I never knew you even existed. Your mother and I had been dating and broken up -- we were both young. She must have been pretty scared and I bet she didn<sq>t know what to do. YOur mother thought she was doing the best thing she could but sometimes when we<sq>re young and scared we make the wrong choices. I will always be here for you.<dq></p>",

This is upsetting information to get from a child.  <br><br>First of all it<sq>s very important that you do not bring this up with your daughter.  She<sq>s very young and children are very suggestible.  She will change what she says depending on what she thinks you want to hear.  This is important because it could be the difference between a social worker/court believing her statement.  I saw that someone else recommended you take her to a child therapist trained in play therapy to try and get a disclosure.  This is a good suggestion.  There are very specific techniques that professionals use to talk to children about these types of things that do not further traumatize the child while also getting a disclosure that will hold up in court.  <br><br>You don<sq>t need a lawyer right now, what would they do? You need to call CPS, RIGHT NOW.  The longer you wait while you suspect abuse is occurring, the more you are implicated in the matter, it is your duty as someone with responsibility for the safety of this child to get the child to safety as soon as possible. <br><br>You don<sq>t say how old your daughter is, but toddler aged children can and do say things that are not true or do not include the entire context.  So depending on what exactly she said (and if you had follow up questions for her, what they were), this could really be nothing.  <br><br>Lastly, my advice comes from someone who spent many years working intensively with youth under 5 who were living in at risk home environments.  I have extensive training in what to do when these types of statements are made by children and then the CPS follow up.<br><br>Good luck! I hope your daughter was just talking about something else, and that she is safe.  <br><br>If you don<sq>t listen to anything else I<sq>ve said, DO NOT BRING THIS UP WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. If she brings it up try not to ask her any leading questions or show approval/disapproval at anything she says.  A good rule of thumb is to repeat back what she says to you in the most neutral tone of voice you can.  <br></p>",

Unlike a lot of people, I wasn<sq>t content on just <dq>waiting for something to happen<dq> and <dq>hoping one day I would meet a nice girl<dq> when I had no social skills to speak of.  Honestly, I think that kind of passive mentality is bullshit and victimizing.  When I stumbled on the seduction community, I was hesitant at first but I went in with an open mind.  <br><br>I first started reading David Deangelo<sq>s <dq>Double Your Dating<dq> series.  It absolutely blew my mind how wrong I was doing everything.  You mean you<sq>re not supposed to kiss the ass of every girl you meet and buy them expensive gifts to impress them?  And the key to being attractive is confidence and the ability to make them laugh?  And I should stop being so insecure about every little thing?  I could go on.<br><br>Reading through seduction books and watching seminars really started changing my life.  Instead of spending every Friday/Saturday night in doors playing World of Warcraft, I started going out to parties and starting conversations with people I<sq>d never met before.  Sure, I may have come off as incredibly awkward for the first few months, but I got over it as I started improving.<br><br>By sophomore year, I had found an unbelievably cute, smart, and nerdy girlfriend that I ended up staying with for quite some time.  A year earlier, I wouldn<sq>t have ever dreamed I could be dating a girl so great.  And before you ask, no I didn<sq>t do any <dq>tricks<dq> to seduce her.  As a result of learning about seduction and actually forcing myself to go out and interact with others, my personality evolved in a way.  I was no longer a needy, negative, insecure, and awkard shut-in.  I was now confident, funny, charming, and fun to be around.<br><br>Seduction isn<sq>t about manipulation.  It<sq>s about giving clueless guys a framework to interact with others.  It<sq>s like if you gave your father Starcraft 2 and he asked you how he can improve and you gave him a build order for his favorite race.  You<sq>re not gonna say that a build order is cheating and that you should learn everything by yourself.  Not everyone has the positive role models in their lives to learn this kind of shit on their own.<br><br>It<sq>s quite sad seeing posts like this spouting so much ignorance and misinformation.  It seems like everyone is so quick to judge something they really know nothing about.  I owe so much of my life to the seduction community and really cringe when I see so much misinformation posted around the internet.</p>",

He was looking for a relationship, and I had just sworn them off.  It didn<sq>t work out, but we did have some great sex before we stopped seeing each other.  After a couple of years we started flirting again, but he had a girlfriend.  One day he invited me over to his house and we slept together again.  Afterwards he got up and went into the bathroom for a while and I got dressed.  He came out and told me how weird he felt.  He said he had never cheated before and he couldn<sq>t believe that he just had.  I had justified it in my head while I was driving over there, that I was single and I wasn<sq>t the one doing the cheating, and that it wasn<sq>t my job to make sure he was faithful.  When he came out of the bathroom and told me how bad he felt I felt awful.  Like the whole thing was my fault.  I left and we didn<sq>t really talk to each other at work or anything.  Then two days later I went to dinner with my friends.  I saw this guy I had just slept with walking up to the restaurant, with his girlfriend holding his hand.  We got up to leave as they were coming in, and I had to say <dq>excuse me<dq> to her so that I could pass by her to get out the door.  She smiled at me and moved.  She had no idea who I was.  She had no idea that just a few days before, her boyfriend and I were laying naked in his bed together.  Maybe I would have felt better if she had caught us, and she could have taken her anger out on me.  I think I wish I had got what I deserved.

                "answer": "<p>Honestly, you two(!) are accepting the gift of free rent from her, which is likely more expensive than all the rest. If you want a normal relationship between her and your bf, he shouldn<sq>t be accepting free rent from her. You are no longer the common denominator because you have pushed a pretty big connection between them. To me it sounds as if she is now trying to deal with the situation by making him a best friend too, where living together and living off someone isn<sq>t quite so weird. I mean you moved him in because your friend<sq>s place - a friend you were already massively imposing upon - was bigger and more convenient. Sorry, but you started this trip down social weird lane. Your boyfriend had no business moving in rent free with your best friend. You weren<sq>t in a housemate situation where partners could just be added. You now can<sq>t start acting as if this is just a housemate thing, because if it were, you guys would all be pulling equal weight. <br><br>I would sit down your best friend and find out her needs. Also cope with her potentially wanting to spend one on one time with the guy she is letting live in her house for free. Schedule in time for each <dq>pair<dq> to do stuff as well as everyone together. Try to start pulling your weight by paying for groceries/take away/cleaning products and make up for your lack of rent by doing more of the household chores. I would also include her in your house renting considerations, so it doesn<sq>t come as a shock when you guys move out. Honestly, this women has done so much for you, a little kindness and consideration won<sq>t kill you. She thinks of you as family and you have taken massive advantage of that - I really don<sq>t see how you can now complain that she is trying to see your boyfriend as family too. Again, you set up the situation in the first place and to me it sounds as if you were hoping she<sq>d just shut up and pay for your upkeep while you get to dance off into the sunset with your man. She isn<sq>t your parent. She doesn<sq>t owe you anything. She is just being lovely. </p>",

Almost a compliment, in a horrible, boundary-stomping way. She<sq>s having a bad social moment, for whatever reason whogivesadamn, and maybe in a few years after she becomes sane again you  can all go back to being friends -- one you will forever keep an eye on, but a friend. <br><br>You could tell her you<sq>re moving out this quickly because you found such a good deal, but eventually you<sq>ll field one too many emails, texts and phone calls making demands for your time. You<sq>ll find yourself repeating no, she can<sq>t call you at night, you<sq>re learning how to live on your own, and no, she can<sq>t come over every weekend, because you need space. Since she<sq>s going to push to continue her intrusion into your relationship, you<sq>ll eventually have to be honest, just so she understands that she doesn<sq>t have a choice. You have boundaries, and she can<sq>t cross them and force herself into your relationship with BF and push you out of it. <br><br>Your BH is a big part of this problem.

That he<sq>d accept you paying while he pockets that money says a LOT about his character. He threw you under the bus, financially, and I<sq>ll bet he didn<sq>t even notice that. He<sq>s not trustworthy in a lot of areas if he doesn<sq>t even know what actions would violate your trust. He doesn<sq>t know the boundaries, or he ignored the obvious boundaries, or he played dumb. <br><br>That<sq>s a red flag, and you need to pay attention to that. He should have known not to accept those gifts, and you had to explain to your adult partner that accepting bribes is wrong. While sitting in free lodgings, which makes it a little awkward, I suppose. <colon>/ This is you adulting for your partner, and that never turns out well for the woman.

Don<sq>t be all civilized and wishy-washy, accept the reality. She<sq>s fucked up this friendship royally, because she<sq>s trying to take what does not belong to her. She NEEDS her feelings hurt, so that she doesn<sq>t try this on someone else. She<sq>s already had a negative effect on you and BF<sq>s life, and when you move out that will impact her life AND IT SHOULD. Because - say it with me - she fucked up. And when you fuck up in the real world, there are consequences.<br><br>She decided she wanted your life, your BF, your relationship. She bribed you both with free this, that and the other - perhaps that wasn<sq>t the intent at first, but the situation has changed, and she is the one who changed it. SAY SO. It was probably just a thought at one time, but that thought has become reality. SPEAK UP. She<sq>s the predator, and you<sq>re sitting there thinking, <dq>I do hope she doesn<sq>t break a tooth when she bites through my backbone!<dq> <br><br>Your BF needs to do some self-education on boundaries inside relationships.

There<sq>s no excuse for her cheating-- none.<br><br>That said, let me tell you this from *her* side of the story, since I know this is what you want to know.<br>Her remorseless behavior suggests that she got over you somewhere near the end of the 7 years of your relationship, and while she wanted you not to hate her, she wants also to be done with the whole thing. She got tired of you not being there in the capacity that she wanted, and she moved on. Before that, with the cheating, those are probably around times in your life that she felt really shitty about you not giving her what exactly she wanted which was probably some sort of attention, or other self-esteem boosting behavior. Chances are, yeah, her self-esteem was pretty low to begin with, and the way it sounds, she wanted you to be really more dedicated boyfriend-- to the loyalty level she was displaying. You say yourself that she<sq>s a low self-confidence girl and you<sq>re an independent minded boy<colon> this was probably what made her cheat. She just didn<sq>t receive the type of attention she craved.<br><br>Lady<sq>s got attention issues. That<sq>s why she did it. Issues? Sure. Wrong? Definitely. But here<sq>s where you need to learn from this 7 years<colon> Some girls need more attention. If you can<sq>t give more attention, stay out of relationships with these needy ones. You aren<sq>t to blame here for the cheating, however be it a lesson that you learn; communicate effectively in your future relationships. Get to know and recognize self-esteem issues for what they are, and if you care about the person, learn to mitigate it (or suggest counseling.) The other lesson you should learn from this is to learn to give. Give more of yourself in every way possible. Women aren<sq>t here to be loyal like puppies, or to dote. Relationships are partnerships. I repeat, again<colon> there is NO excuse for her cheating on you, none, however, it sounds like from the way you write (and what she said) that you weren<sq>t a very giving person in the relationship, and she probably felt really inadequate. People cheat often because they feel inadequate and unfulfilled in relationships.<br><br> She was probably still loyal to you in her mind, while rationalizing her behavior in some sort of self-preservatory way. This is another reason for the remorselessness. Full guilt isn<sq>t hers because she rationalizes that it was due to the fact that you didn<sq>t pay attention to her the way she wanted. Also, she just wants to rid herself of the 7 years that maybe she felt inadequate, or unfulfilled. She isn<sq>t answering now because she has convinced herself that you never really cared, and you were in it just to be coddled while she effectively <dq>got neglected.<dq><br><br>Sorry if this hurts. I hope it sheds some light on why she (probably) acted the way she did, and how you can fix it next time.<br><br>TLDR<colon> She has attention issues. She felt inadequate in the relationship. While it<sq>s not your fault that she cheated and left you, there are lessons to learn and new things to implement<colon> Learn to communicate effectively, and to give more in your relationships, and that will help with future issues.</p>",

So, let me preface this by saying that you will most likely be offended by this reply because I<sq>m lacking in the art of diplomacy here. That<sq>s OK though, if it<sq>ll help you and your daughter fix this problem you<sq>re having. <br><br>I<sq>m going to take your statements and paint another picture here.<br><br>> Secondly, I am not delusional about her <dq>activities<dq> or so I thought. She is 17 and just had her first kiss last year. This is her 2nd most serious relationship and I thought they were not sexually active. He comes over often to hang out but other than forbidding bedrooms I do not stalk them and she has other siblings that are around so there isn<sq>t 100<percent> privacy at any time.<br><br>Let<sq>s start here. You **are** clearly delusional about her activities since you just caught her giving her boyfriend a blowjob in a highly visible situation. Most teenagers aren<sq>t exhibitionists by default, so ask yourself why she<sq>s taking that risk rather than talk with you about sex. Maybe there is a connection here by your non-stalking control of her activities and this situation?<br><br>>She also was supposed to come to me before things progressed this far. I<sq>m not sure if they have had intercourse now. So my first step is addressing that. I<sq>ve always told her when she is ready she should be mature enough to approach me and we can get birth control, but if she can<sq>t then she<sq>s not mature enough to be having sex. She had always claimed she wasn<sq>t even close to that yet. <br><br>She was supposed to tell you when she was ready to have sex. This is basically you telling her that she needs to seek your **approval** to have sex. Can<sq>t you see how that fosters an aura of mistrust? Imagine being in her shoes, you have a sexy boyfriend, you<sq>ve just discovered orgasms yourself, you<sq>re forming a relationship with a great guy. But no, you can<sq>t have sex until you tell your mom about it and ASK her if it<sq>s OK to have sex with him. What if you<sq>d said no? What if you<sq>d made sure they were separated? This isn<sq>t just her wanting to have sex, this is her wanting to take the next intimacy step with her beloved and you<sq>re wondering why she<sq>d rather sneak around than risk you interfering with that? <br><br>Let me ask you a question<colon> WHY do you need to know if she<sq>s having sex? Can<sq>t you respect her need for privacy and just make sure she has had the talk and that she<sq>s got access to contraceptives without needing to know the details?<br><br>> I did speak with her immediately when it happened and said that I could not believe she would be doing that with her siblings present and I immediately took him home.<br><br>So you<sq>ve basically confirmed her worst fear now. You have to realize that right now, you<sq>ve made it almost impossible for yourself to get a straight answer out of your daughter regarding sex. You<sq>ve condemned and excersized authority when you should be asking questions and trying to be understanding.<br><br>And you ask me why she<sq>s crying? I<sq>ll tell you, she probably thinks you<sq>re going to mess with her relationship with her boyfriend and she might even be scared you<sq>ll tell his parents and that they<sq>ll have to break it off. <br><br>How do you resolve this? First off, get some one one one time with her and start off by apologizing for your reaction earlier. Tell her that you realize that you<sq>ve gone about this all wrong and that you<sq>ve been blind to your daughter having become a woman. Then tell her that regardless of what she says, you ARE getting her contraceptives and wether she uses those is up to her and none of your business, but that you<sq>d rather wish she<sq>d be an adult about it and practice safe sex. Because seriously, let<sq>s be honest here, you have ZERO control of her sex life no matter how much you want to. The more authority you excersize, the more likely she<sq>s going to end up having unprotected sex somewhere and get pregnant in the process. You don<sq>t want that.<br><br>Then you tell her that she can have privacy with her boyfriend if she wishes to and that a closed door means <dq>don<sq>t disturb<dq> from now on. But also let her know that public displays of sex are not something you wish to see again and that if they are going to have sex, they better keep it down. <br><br>However, I have written this all with the assumption that it<sq>s legal for kids their age to have sex wherever you are. If it<sq>s not, then you have to have a slightly different discussion with her where you tell her that she has to wait for a few more years, because even though you understand her urges, the law does not. But, regardless, the question you should be asking yourself isn<sq>t <dq>should I punish her?<dq> but rather <dq>how did we end up with her giving her boyfriend a blowjob on the sofa?<dq><br></p>",

It is not being left to you and your fiance. It is being left to you. It is something that should stay with you if the worst were to happen and you were to break up.<br><br>Now to play devils advocate, maybe she has not thought of it this way.

That if you buy a house with the inheritance its both of yours. That your bank accounts are still joint. That every success of yours is still her success. It is only the inheritance which is yours.<br><br>4) Encourage her to get her own lawyer to look after it. After all your dad<sq>s lawyer is not her lawyer. She should be afforded the same protection of having a lawyer look over the document.<br><br>5) Finally, don<sq>t marry her if she refuses to sign a prenup saying your inheritance is yours. She has told you the type of divorce she is gonna give you if it comes to that. And that means all bets are off the table if she decides that 1.5 million dollars is worth it. You should not give into her unreasonable claim to your inheritance just because she is either A) incapable of understanding your valid reasoning or B) just wants a claim to your inheritance. <br><br>If you are incapable of telling your wife no, that she does not have claim to your inheritance, then you should ask your dad to write you out of his will.

I want to reply to everyone but I feel slightly overwhelmed so I<sq>m just going to write a few things that come to mind here<colon><br><br>When I say go to clubs, talk to people and meet women, I<sq>m not suggesting that you should do this looking for a partner or to enter into a long term relationship. Many men on reddit, and myself included, are not typical people who like clubbing. The reason I suggest people go to clubs and talk to everyone is because it is an environment where you can just talk to everyone and anyone and its not particularly weird, its just really, really scary. The first time you do it, you<sq>ll be scared and won<sq>t know what to say, the next time a little less so, then a little less... my goal is to show you that you can talk to anyone, anywhere at any time and be really really good at it. There are so few guys who are good at being able to talk to beautiful women AS a person. Its one thing to talk AT beautiful women, its another thing to connect with and talk TO beautiful women. Why would talking to randoms in a club help you with this? It trains you to let go of your fear of anything bad happening, it shows you that you can do it and you push your comfort zone.<br><br>To people who are saying that doing these things will turn you into a douchebag and make you an asshole kind of guy, and these are activities that douchebag kind of people do; since when has going to the gym and bettering yourself been a douchebag thing? I<sq>m not telling you to call everyone BROSEF and drink with your gym buddies whilst prowling for women wearing fake tan. <br><br>Going to the gym is as much mental as it is physical, if you start lifting weights and pursing gains in strength and muscle you will find that it takes willpower and effort to stick to it. Not everyone can do that, it trains you to keep going and pushing through the pain, its a place to ground yourself in life when things are getting difficult. There are so many benefits to doing it for YOURSELF. Many people lift to get big to get girls, and that isn<sq>t what I<sq>m suggesting.<br><br>When I suggested activities to do such as, <dq>boxing, mma, rock climbing, parkour, tricking, mountain biking, scuba diving, surfing. (anything in the same vein is fine)<dq>. You don<sq>t have to do MMA or any kind of violent sport if you don<sq>t want to. It does however teach you something very important about yourself, you learn to defend yourself and stand up for yourself. You will develop a sense of <dq>I can handle this and myself<dq> confidence in other situations in life. Its a feeling of being comfortable in your own skin and your surroundings, some people are already comfortable in their surroundings and they don<sq>t want/need/care for this. That is fine, you can do any other sport, the goal isn<sq>t to teach you to be able to handle yourself, its to get you doing something YOU are interested in that you can share with others.<br><br>You can do anything you want, you don<sq>t have to follow my advice, you can change it up as you wish. When I wrote this I specifically wrote it with this paraphrased Chinese proverb as a caveat <dq>If you have a full cup, I can<sq>t pour you any more tea.<dq> My advice is pointless if you have a preconceived notion of what this will lead to, and what the point is.Its simple it<sq>s just about building confidence and putting yourself in new situations. Getting out of your comfort zone and sticking to it for three months. I personally did this years ago and it changed my life in a significant way. I<sq>ve helped a few people do the same. I just find that for the average person my short list of things to do will make the biggest changes in the shortest amount of time. Once you are at a point where you can talk to anyone and you are comfortable in what you do, your social circle is larger than when you began and you are more comfortable in your own skin; you won<sq>t need my advice. You<sq>ll know exactly how to get what you want and any desire that you have that isn<sq>t being fulfilled in any aspect of your life will be easier to solve as you develop a new skill set.<br><br>I was never a communicator, its one of those things where you try it out, you think you know whats happening, then in three months you look back and think <dq>damn I didn<sq>t know what happening at all<dq>. Then you understand that it isn<sq>t about changing as a person, its just about experiencing the world and how your experience changes your perception of situations. You won<sq>t go on a date again and worry about what the girl is thinking and if she likes you or not, because you know that there are many pretty women in this world that like you. You just want to get to know the girl you<sq>re going out on a date with, and if she doesn<sq>t like you back then c<sq>est la vie; you have a new friend. What happens though, as you stop worrying about whether women like you, is you sub-communicate attractive qualities that draw them in. <br><br>My point<colon> If you are happy then I<sq>m glad, you only have one life, happy people are rare; my advice is not for you. If you aren<sq>t happy then here is something you can try, you will find yourself pushing boundaries and growing as a person. The more you experience, the better you are able to focus in on things that make you happy.<br></p>",

My concern is that you<sq>ve only acknowledged it to be a problem recently, because people who are high on opiates really, truly can<sq>t hide they<sq>re on opiates.<br><br>You absolutely cannot take your kids away from her without initiating a custody battle. Until you can prove she is unfit to care for her kids, you both have equal parental rights and cannot have any say in the other<sq>s. Even if you did prove she was unfit and got full custody, she would still be entitled to visitation. I can<sq>t speak to her personality, but the general mentality of an addict is that they will do just about anything in their power to control other people - especially the people closest to them.<br><br>You need to take steps to get yourself and your kids a safe place to go. You need to flush your prescription directly down the toilet and if you have a joint account you need to stop any and all direct deposits, bill payments you<sq>re responsible for, etc. attached to it and transfer them to a new account with only your name in it. Don<sq>t carry any cash and get a lockbox for your valuables that you can<sq>t store somewhere else.<br><br>Contact a lawyer and establish an effective plan. Identify a place to live (with friends or family or otherwise) and make any arrangements related to that. When you<sq>re ready, serve her and go. This might mean you have to leave your kids there and visit them until this can be resolved. This sucks, but your in-laws (codependent and unpleasant as they might be) are the other responsible adults in this situation. And this will prevent you and your wife from getting into some kind of altercation that will be used as leverage against you in court.<br><br>Regarding your relationship, you are in a lifelong partnership with her because of your kids. You love her, and there are valid, understandable reasons why you fell in love with her. Going through this process does not mean you can<sq>t get back together, or even just have a friendship with mutual respect raising your kids together. Right now, though, she needs a reality check about what you will and will not tolerate. Anything facilitating her ongoing drug use over the well being of her life partner and children is a hard no.

We talked about it and she was willing to give it a try and see if we last and my thought was if we can get through this phase I\u2019m going to marry her. Year apart and both of us were torn but put a lot of things into perspective for me and I asked her to marry me on my break back home.

She asked if I was going to have a stag and I said no because it\u2019s not a big deal and I probably don\u2019t\u2019 have the time for it.

She told me she met someone there and just had sex on ecstasy and she enjoyed herself and she needed to get that out of her system and now shes ready for the wedding. She just told me it was just awesome I was utterly crushed to hear that and I asked her why. She told me it was everything the distance, my absence, stupid small arguments over the years and it all had built up and she needed it.

He was hurt, obviously, but when he asked me about it and told me he was upset, I said that I was just joking around but I stopped to think about what I really felt and I found that his comment made me feel bad about myself and I said something I knew would make him feel bad too.

Fear is what keeps us from being open with partners, it keeps us from accepting ourselves and it keeps us from letting go of pain that others have caused. <br><br><br>So my advice to you is to be honest with yourself about who you are, the behavior you<sq>re capable of, what you need, what you want and what you fear.

I<sq>m not opposed to being submissive; during sex I frequently adopt a submissive role for him--so that isn<sq>t the issue. I also don<sq>t mind being treated as a sexual object; I look at it as a form of role play. I think what bothers me is the formality of it. I feel like if I have to put it on and present myself to him, it feels like a performance to me and I just feel so pressured and nervous that it makes me uncomfortable enough to not want to try. <br><br>Sometimes I feel the same way about my partner performing oral sex on me--I end up feeling so pressured to perform (aka orgasm) that it makes me anxious and turned off so I just opt out of the act all together.<br><br>I personally like sex to be organic.

The lack of a sex drive, the short fuse, even the trouble getting along with her son. Of it is untreated, when you bring up her behaviours, she gets offended because she knows that what you are saying is true and just hates herself more because it<sq>s also upsetting you. She doesn<sq>t want to talk about it because saying it out loud makes it even more real. She needs therapy and possibly medication.

Her husband isn<sq>t happy so she is a failure as a wife. This May be what she thinks about all the time.

I don<sq>t know what I can do to help but maybe a therapist will be able to give you advice on what to do. We can do couples counseling to help fix us. We both have thoughts in our heads that we aren<sq>t able to clearly say to each other without causing hurt. I love you with all my heart and all I want is for you to be happy.

It<sq>s easier when you don<sq>t live at home, and it<sq>ll get easier when you and your parents start to see each other more like equals.

It takes a certain kind of person to cheat on someone who loves them and they claim to love in return, and it isn<sq>t the kind of person that any self-respecting individual should want in their lives. She needs to go, and she needs to go NOW. There will be none of this <dq>fixing<dq> nonsense. Fixing is for <dq>Babe, i got legitimately roofied at a party and did some sketchy things, please forgive me for the love of God<dq>, not <dq>I tripped and fell on his dick<dq>. It is up to you, but if you are like 90<percent> of the people on this crazy world of ours, you deserve better than to live in a relationship where you will forever wonder if that was the last time. <br><br>After this happens, you<sq>re going to feel the pain. And trust me<colon> it<sq>s going to *suck*. People say getting a hobby or learning a new skill makes everything ok, but that<sq>s just not completely true, is it? It makes things a little easier, but at the end of day, you<sq>ll remember what is happening to you, and it<sq>s going to feel like it<sq>s happening all over again. <br><br>But here is the most amazing, most beautiful part of this entire experience, which frankly, I can virtually guarantee you won<sq>t be able to process yet<colon> you are dodging nuclear, wire-guided, silver bullet right now. And you are going to be able to walk away from this on your own goddamn terms, because you have the *choice* to stay or go. It may seem like everything is going to hell in a handbasket right now, but if you take anything away from my little rant, take that away<colon> YOU ARE IN CONTROL NOW. You have been alerted to the situation in a way that gives you time to think, somewhat process, and hopefully avoid making a decision you will regret. Don<sq>t waste it<colon> I personally didn<sq>t get that chance. I walked in on the act. I said and did things that nearly cost me a good portion of my life (money wise). <br><br>As for the now<colon> I don<sq>t know how you process, but I can tell you one thing<colon> you need to get your house in order ASAP.  Everything you hold dear needs to be in your possession, exactly where you want it to be, before she even gets a whiff of a hint that you know. Every password needs to be changed, every key and possession accounted for and secured. You MUST NOT fly off the handle. You are in control here. <br><br>Lastly, and probably most importantly of all<colon> you need to understand that this is, given the circumstances, potentially the best thing that could happen to you. Being cheated on is one thing...being cheated on and not knowing until it has a larger impact on you is another. Move on, cope, and I swear to you, you will wake up someday and realize that you don<sq>t care that this happened anymore.  It is an amazing feeling, and it is probably going to be followed immediately by an almost indescribable sensation of that last little weight leaving your shoulders. <br><br>You<sq>ll be ok in the end. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Oh I have lived this same thing - not exactly the same circumstances - but staying with someone I should have long ago <dq>fired<dq> from the job of being my GF even after they hurt me again and again.  Oh, and btw I did this _with more than one girl, too_... even married one of them and put up with a 9 month long affair, forgave that then stay married to her for another 6 years until she did it again.  And my story is more fucked up than that, but let<sq>s just say I could not imagine myself as more of a loser for the choices I made over literally 12 years.<br><br>So I know that pain, I know what it feels like to have no one to talk to, to feel utterly alone in the dark with your pain.  That<sq>s why you want to hold on to your GF, because the thought of the black emptiness of the void without her is terrifying and lonely beyond belief.  And because you emotions are telling you that her treatment of you is some evidence that there is something wrong with YOU so if you can only fix things maybe that means you<sq>re not so broken.<br><br>Well let me just tell you that your emotions are lying to you, and have been for a very long time.  That certainty that this pain gives about how bad things are - about how bad _you_ are - is false and completely wrong.<br><br>I don<sq>t know why, but when people like you and I get this kind of pain handed to us, it<sq>s like our brains are gaslighting themselves - no outside abuser necessary (though your GF sounds just awful and may be doing it too).   I can<sq>t stress enough how you have to be very skeptical of any conclusions you take from how you feel.  You need to challenge those automatic thoughts that this extremely upsetting relationship and turn of events is probably causing in your right now.<br><br>I<sq>m not sure precisely how I gained a foothold on myself to start making things better, but it happened slowly except for a for watershed moments, like when my father died.<br><br>But what I did was to try to learn as much about myself, psychology, happiness, depression and relationships as I could.  I read a lot of things, tried to push myself to do things differently and I did get therapy.  <br><br>If there<sq>s any feeling I could seed in you right now, it would be curiosity - a burning curiosity to question why you were feeling like you were, why you had made those choices you made, why anyone makes bad choices, in fact.  Curiosity about what choices people make and thoughts they think that help them to not go to this terrible, dark, lonely place that you and I know so very well.  Curiosity and seeking information and HELP (both self help and help from others) is what has stopped me from making the bad choices that I feel ruined more than decade of my life.<br><br>We aren<sq>t the same person, of course, and your way out from this may be very different than mine, but please do try to be curious and ask yourself a lot of very NON-JUDGMENTAL questions about your life, past and present (by non-judgmental I mean, no questions that assume bad things about you i.e. BAD<colon> <dq>so how did I fuck this up?<dq>  GOOD<colon> <dq>what happened to lead to me making that choice<dq> - just stick to facts and circumstances).  Please just try to take in some information, read some things, ask questions on appropriate subreddits like /r/getting_over_it or other depression subreddits (since depression is common and seems compatible with what you<sq>ve posted here).<br><br>Learn, try things, and most of all _be kind to yourself_.   Treat yourself sometimes.   There are ways of thinking, exiting ideas for things to learn and do out there in the world and even if your heart<sq>s not in it for a while due to this pain, should still try things when you can - you never know what you will find until you at least _try_.<br><br>Good luck!<br></p>",

It is the pivotal moment when a couple must learn that communication is as vitally important as it is FUCKING DIFFICULT.  It is problema n\u00famero uno in MOST of the posts I see on this sub, and you<sq>s about to get a pep talk! So sit right down and read on!!<br><br>There are TWO problems here, and they need to be addressed one at a time. Fixing the sex will have to wait. You have a bigger job than that to do first.<br><br>She won<sq>t acknowledge there<sq>s a problem. If she insists on pretending everything<sq>s normal and fine, then there is a very toxic barrier of communication. So the first thing that needs to be addressed is the breakdown of communication between you two, and why it is occurring. This is the nitty gritty shit that separates the men from the boys in relationships. People say they can talk to their SO about anything, but what they really mean is that they<sq>re good at lying in the dark and trading deep dark secrets or playing get-to-know-you games. And that<sq>s great, but it won<sq>t get you past the first few months of a relationship. Once you<sq>re in the trenches with someone, once they<sq>re a goddamn FIXTURE in your life, THAT<sq>s when the heavy shit starts happening. Quiet resentments build. Libidos shut down. Sure, you and your girlfriend can talk about anything; one time she told you about how once her dad lost his temper and slapped her, and how once she made out with her friend at camp, and omg she<sq>s never told ANYONE that and she would trust you with ANYTHING.<br><br>But can she approach you and tell you that sex with you scares her because you always hurt her but she doesn<sq>t want to make you feel guilty? Can she tell you that she hates the way you always pick what you guys watch on TV but she<sq>s let it happen for so long she doesn<sq>t know how to bring it up without starting a fight? Is she feeling trapped and smothered, but she wouldn<sq>t dream of saying anything because on paper you<sq>re just so wonderful, and she<sq>s in too deep, and you<sq>re safe, and she<sq>s being selfish.... <br><br>THIS shit. All this shit I just wrote out in a stream of consciousness. This is the kind of stuff that rattles around in peoples<sq> skulls and slowly poisons a relationship. For whatever reason, she feels like she can<sq>t air what she<sq>s feeling. That<sq>s not necessarily your fault, bud. People have weird complexes and anxieties. She may be agonizing over her reduced sex drive and is terrified to tell you why because she<sq>s afraid it<sq>ll torpedo the relationship.<br><br>But this is the first hurdle you must cross. It<sq>s the biggest, and hardest hurdle. Fix. The. Communication. It will be awkward, and scary, and difficult. It may take months. <br><br>After that, after you both are on the same page, you can set goals to address the problem and get your sex life back on track. That<sq>s the easy part.<br><br>Edit<colon> I might add, drop the <dq>angel<dq> crap. You<sq>re putting her on a pedestal and that<sq>s dehumanizing. You are blinding yourself to the reality of *her*, as a person. She may be beautiful and smart and funny and her skin may glow, but she<sq>s a human being with all sorts of the same internalized garbage, trauma, and complexes that everyone else is carrying around. Look at her as the person that she is. She is not sent from on high; she is your partner. You need to get to know, acknowledge, and *love* all of her strengths and weaknesses.</p>",

I<sq>m a pretty naturally introverted, but my homebody-ness has gotten to a point similar to what you describe although I try to still keep things clean haha. For me personally, I<sq>ve just lost a lot of motivation to do things, especially things I don<sq>t *have* to do. When I do end up doing things, like going out with close friends or to the mall with my gf, I usually end up feeling forced just cause I probably wouldn<sq>t go if I know it wouldn<sq>t make the ones closest to me upset. I<sq>m also having some confidence issues in certain areas of life, I feel apathetic, lost interest in hobbies, procrastinate, and lack the drive and ambition that I once had. This started a few years back when I started college and eventually caused me to lose a good amount of friends a couple years from there. Depression is what started it all. These days, it<sq>s not always because I<sq>m depressed. I could just be I want to be alone/recharge(introversion), or could just be having a bad day, or could be really hating on myself that day. Or it could be all of them at once. Don<sq>t want to go on too much about me, but your gf may also be experiencing a lot of these same feelings. How they affect someone depends on the person, but they are red flags in any case. I think you should just try talking to her and getting her to open up. She may have a lot bottled inside. If you don<sq>t want to be in a relationship anymore than that<sq>s something else, but if you want to be there for her and continue with your relationship, getting her to open would be a good step. Just try not to pry too much initially since she could already not be feeling well that day. When I<sq>m feeling shitty, I don<sq>t necessarily jump at the opportunity to talk about why in detail. Show her she<sq>s not alone, too. Be there for her in little ways if you can. Idk the nature of your relationship, but maybe do little things like cook her her favorite food, buy her a small, but thoughtful gift, give her a hug, cuddle, do her a small favor. If she is feeling depressed, these things will ultimately make it easier for her to open up since it<sq>ll kind of remind her that you are there for her. It<sq>s easy to forget that there are people who care about you when your head<sq>s in a dark place. I hope things start to improve. </p>",

It<sq>s a fantasy, and really does have nothing to do with you. The girls on screen have no value to him, and no place in his life other than for a quick fap. He doesn<sq>t care about their feelings, doesn<sq>t want to make them happy or listen to their hopes and dreams, he probably doesn<sq>t even want to bother looking at them after he gets off. He literally thinks about them for the time that he<sq>s fapping to the vids, and no longer. He<sq>d share the vid online to a thousand strangers in a heartbeat, and if it ever got deleted he wouldn<sq>t think about it for a second. He<sq>d just find a new one...would he do that with you? Share you, and replace you? No. The answer, is no. <br><br>YOU are the one he values, YOU are the one he spends his time with, YOU are the one he loves. Also, he thinks you are beautiful and sexy, and he loves being with you. I<sq>m kind of reaching a bit here, but you<sq>re not asking how to talk to him about this, so you don<sq>t seem to want to blame him for this...that makes me think that your relationship is pretty healthy and you two are for the most part happy. If that<sq>s true, remember what place those porn girls have in his life. Similar to a virtual flesh light. This means that no matter how good a wank he has to vids of big breasted toothpicks, it will never ever be as good as a tumble with the love of his life. <br><br>Personally I watch all kinds of porn, but usually the men are tall and muscular, and well endowed. My boyfriend is pretty tall, but other than that doesn<sq>t resemble pornstars that I<sq>ve seen ...and I -love- sex with him. I love pleasing him, I love his body. I<sq>m not thinking about porn stars when I<sq>m in the sack, and I<sq>m not wishing his body was more like some porn star. My bf taking off his shirt is sexy to me, and I love being naked with him. I<sq>m sure your man is the same way about you, but if you need to hear it from him, tell him that you need to hear that you<sq>re beautiful and he loves you. Honestly, guys often appreciate the clear request for attention. At least my guy does, he<sq>s none too good about subtle cues (which is fine, that<sq>s not really my style anyway). <br><br>Work on actively monitoring your thoughts. Everytime that nagging insecurity comes in and tries to make you feel bad about porn remind yourself that these are not REAL girls, your boyfriend loves YOU the way you are, and you are not expected or wished to be like them. He doesn<sq>t look at you like a porn star, he looks at you with love. He sees your beauty, not just your tits or ass. That<sq>s a huge distinction. <br><br>I hope this helps, but mostly I just hope you feel better. (hugs)<br><br>EDIT<colon> Thank you so much for whoever gifted me the gold. I really appreciate it, and I<sq>m glad that people have found this post useful. <br><br>EDIT #2<colon> DISCLAIMER<colon> I did not intend to devalue or dehumanize anyone with my statements. Perhaps I could have chosen a better word than <sq>real<sq> but...I couldn<sq>t think of one that described what I wanted to say better. To be fair, I wasn<sq>t talking about ONLY the girls. Yes, I said the girls aren<sq>t real girls...but the senarios aren<sq>t real either, neither are the attitudes, dialogue or the sex (yeah they<sq>re really fucking, but is she -really- cumming that hard?). Porn doesn<sq>t reflect real life, and the people in it do not reflect real life relationships. He doesn<sq>t love her less because he watches some video, and he<sq>s not sitting there thinking that she needs bigger tits or a flatter tummy because of the girls he watches in porn. That<sq>s all I was trying to say to her. My aim was to show that porn is a pretty insignificant part of most people<sq>s lives, and the actors in the videos do not occupy space in most peoples hearts or minds. Girls with big breasts, girls with small breasts, porn stars and housewives, ALL people, ALL deserving of respect. Not <sq>real<sq> as in not competition, not a standard to hold yourself to, not something that needs to be worried about. Its just porn. </p>",

But, you must have done something to be hospitalized the first time around that would lend credence to whatever your husband is telling your doctor now. People simply are not hospitalized for no reason, particularly for a month. Also, the doctor would almost certainly wouldn<sq>t make that drastic of a change to your medication without seeing you. So, it<sq>s possible your husband told you that without actually speaking to the doctor.<br><br>- You may be distorting reality due to your condition. Something definitely happened to get you hospitalized the first time around. Again, month long hospitalizations do not happen without a cause. We<sq>ve had people in full blown psychotic meltdowns who actually did injure themselves or others go into hospitalization and be released two days later. Further, there are a few points in your story that make me think this could be the likely explanation. The idea that you are being forced to take medication, and that is your only option, is false. Once you are out of hospitalization, no one is forcing you to take your meds (husband potentially, but certainly not your doctor). If you were <dq>perfectly good and healthy<dq>, you could stop taking the meds and be fine, right? So, who would know that you weren<sq>t taking them? Also, you are not <dq>locked<dq> in the house with your husband. You can walk out the door. This sounds very much like delusions of persecution, a hallmark symptom of paranoid schizophrenia.<br><br>Now, that doesn<sq>t mean that your husband didn<sq>t crush up a pill and put it in your drink. It doesn<sq>t mean that he didn<sq>t mess with your medication without speaking to the doctor. But to me, it does mean that maybe you should take your diagnosis a little more seriously. Denial of symptoms IS a symptom of schizophrenia. I do behavioral ratings every week with patients, with many telling me there is nothing wrong with them while explaining how the last four news reports they saw on TV were secret messages saying someone was coming to kill them. I also work with patients who have great insight into their symptoms and manage them well enough that you probably wouldn<sq>t know anything was wrong if you passed them on the street.<br><br>So, I guess this was a long way of saying, sure, your husband may be doing something behind your back, and if you can, try to be clever and figure out what<sq>s going on. But on the other hand, please, please do yourself a favor and actually go to your psychiatrist. Go talk to him/her and express exactly what you<sq>ve told us. The doctor knows your history, and knows your medications. If something is going on, he or she can likely help without hospitalizing you, particularly if you had been stable for as long as you claim. <br><br></p>",

When an adult is mentally ill, they are in charge of their care so that means you are in charge. Have you signed rights over to this doctor to be able to speak with your husband? If you did, you need to revoke it. Does he have power of attorney over you? If not, the doctor cannot talk to him without your permission. Make sure he isn<sq>t allowed to talk with any of your doctors. It is possible you have mental health problems but your husband is scaring you right now. Is there someone you<sq>d feel safe with? If so, try to go stay with that person and get legal and medical help for yourself.<br><br>My only concern is that you truly do have some mental health issues. When someone is in the midst of serious mental illness they often think they are the sanest person they know. My sister is like that. She has more than one serious mental illness along with a ton of medical issues. I tried to get her help in the few days I was with her recently and her state has made it virtually impossible to help her. Please go to someone you trust and take a break from your husband and go to doctors of your choice and follow their advice. Do not sign over any rights to your husband if you don<sq>t trust him right now. Some states (if you are in the US) have patient advocates. Try to see if that service is available to you. Then you have an unbiased third party to help you navigate all of this. I think you really need to get to a place where you feel safe and I wish you well and hope you heal and get through this situation safely. </p>",

Your family should have had your back the entire time and cut off your sister.  <br><br>This is what you need to do<colon><br><br>1) Form an emotional support group with your friends.<br><br>2) This is the most important part. Get a good lawyer. Your sister will want you to sign the divorce papers so your husband will not have to provide alimony, spousal support and child support. She is only interested in whats best for her and NOT YOU. You must start thinking of what is best for your baby and you! Even if you can afford to take care of the baby on your own, that money can go into a child<sq>s college fund. If you cannot afford a lawyer, there are women<sq>s help group for this and some lawyer will take on this case if your husband has a decent paying job. Please reply and we can go from there.<br><br>3) Save all evidence that your husband cheated on you and your sister took your husband away from you. If you are in the US, the court system will back you up. Evidence is key here. Save evidence such as the letter she wrote to you, her texts, your husbands text. If you have access to your husbands accounts, print any conversation where he cheated on you emotionally or physically with her. Copy all of his bank records and pay stubs. <br><br>4) Cut off all contact with Rick, your sister and any family member that does not support you. If they contact you and you feel the need to say something, then tell them this<colon> <dq>Rick was my husband and cheated on me with my sister. I was there for my sister when she needed me the most when her husband died. My sister then took my husband away from me. Knowing the above, you still feel the need to blame me. Please do not contact me anymore as I feel real family would never do this to me.<dq> This is in case your sister is twisting the story. If they show the slightest possibility of blaming you, or defending your sister, or trying to reason with you, then CUT contact immediately. <br><br>5)DO NOT LISTEN to what your sister, rick, your family(if they are neutral or blame you) want you to do. Rick will never be yours and will always switch between your sister and you. This will be very emotional toxic for you. Stay away from Rick. He will say anything for sex. <br><br>6) This is the hardest important part. Do you want to keep this baby? <br><br>      -If yes, treat your baby as if nothing happened. The baby should never know the past until maybe after they are 18. If possible, get your lawyer to give no visitation to Rick. Get your lawyer to get as much child support and alimony from the divorce with your husband. Rick is a horrible person and should not be near your baby.<br><br>      -If no, please start looking into adopting the child.<br><br>Please remember none of this is your fault. Rick and your sister are horrible people. Any family that blames you and does not support you is not family. You must start working on what is best for your baby and you. <br></p>",

Don<sq>t get me wrong, we still got a divorce, but having nothing to lose and being completely honest meant that we were able to see the relationship clearly for the first time in a long time.

For the purposes of this comment, I<sq>m going to call your girlfriend, <dq>Zero,<dq> because she is one and I need a moniker.<br><br>Zero does not need people enabling her. What she needs is people who push her towards actions which will help her achieve firm objectives. Even if her goals are just to lie in bed with a computer all day, she still needs to have a job (and possibly finish her education to have that job) to be able to afford internet access, rent, and food.<br><br>Cut Zero off. Not in a one fell swoop, but make a timeline of a disintegrating budget over the course of a month or two, and *stick to it*. Do not make it easy for her to cop out of life. Because that is EXACTLY what she is doing. In that vein, do not do ANYTHING for her she has the facilities to do herself. This should start immediately. Anything she can do, she has to do. Since you seem fairly committed to staying with her (though I can<sq>t imagine why), you are no longer allowed to be Zero<sq>s doormat, enabling Yes-Man. From a personal note, staying with her is an incredible kindness. Her actions speak to me of a mentality that would, if you dumped her, simply blame everything on you and move back in with her parents and eat everything in the house - parents, furniture, and foundation inclusive - then die. This is no reason to stay with her, but this is probably what will happen if you dump her - not because of you, but because, to reiterate, she is a Zero.<br><br>Zero, if you are in fact reading this - what you<sq>re doing is what people in retirement communities do, because they literally are not physically capable of doing anything else. You are one of the most fortunate people in the world. Beyond just being born and living in the developed world (the odds of this are statistically very, very low), you have a boyfriend and parents who LOVE YOU AND WANT TO HELP YOU. Do you have any idea how rare that is? How impossibly, unbelievably special that is? These are privileges afforded to so few and you should be earning them by making yourself into the best possible person you could be, not throwing it away on minute experiences which are literally changing your brain chemistry to reward you for doing things which are a complete waste of time. Stop going on reddit. Do not use the internet for anything except for schoolwork and looking for jobs. This might be the most important thing of them all. The internet is INCREDIBLY addictive, especially in your case it seems, and it<sq>s cutting off your ability to relate to other people (as expressed through your lack of empathy). You need to change your brain chemistry so you perceive rewards coming from socialization with other, actual people in your life. <br><br>You should also be fucking ashamed of yourself. Seriously. You need a good dose of shame, it<sq>s an excellent motivator. Take off all your clothes, stand in front of a mirror, and recite everything you<sq>ve accomplished that day. Short list, I imagine. Did you feed your cat? Did you ask your boyfriend how his day was? Did you make dinner for the both of you? Can you remember the last time you did something selfless, purely to make your boyfriend or literally anyone else happy? You know, like non-Zero people do? Did you shower? Now imagine what your boyfriend and parents have accomplished with their days - these good people who you could not possibly compare to, who work their asses off to provide for you, and ask in return only that YOU TRY. Not even for them, but for yourself. The only thing parents ever want from their children is to see them grow into something they themselves are proud of. Are you happy? Are you proud? I hope not, because, to reiterate, YOU ARE A ZERO.<br><br>Two other recommendations<colon> start therapy, immediately. Try something like cognitive behavioural therapy. All of the things you need to do in life probably feel like insurmountable obstacles right now. CBT works by establishing short-term goals that are easily achievable, and changing the reward system you have in your brain. Start seeing a therapist, and STICK TO IT. On that note<colon><br><br>> We are not sensitive people and can take criticism very well<br><br>You think that now, but it<sq>s because no one is saying the things you are afraid of them saying, the truths your brain has cleverly eluded from the forefront of your brain. Criticism you welcome, you probably have a bunch of snappy replies for that. Reality doesn<sq>t give a shit about your wit, and neither do therapists. Good therapists know how to create a line of questioning that forces you to face reality (which you are afraid of, being a giant Zero), then give you the tools to help you deal with that reality. You desperately need this. <br><br>Also - start volunteering. It is one of the most rewarding experiences someone can have and you need to be faced with hard evidence of the lives which are so much worse than your own. Until you experience this, you will never understand exactly what it is you are throwing away.<br><br>Start today. Make a list of 5 things - shower, complete one school assignment, do something nice for your boyfriend without ANY expectation of reciprocation (OP - you may say thank you. That is all), make an appointment with your doctor (and ask for a therapy referral when you<sq>re there), and to reward yourself, visit /r/1200isplenty (your only reddit allotment for the day, you<sq>re still incredibly dependent on reddit as a source of reward because you<sq>re a giant Zero of a human being) and bookmark your favourite recipes on there.

If she wants you to babysit, tell her honestly that her kid is not being nice or behaving well and it is affecting your kid and you<sq>re sorry but you can<sq>t watch her kid. I don<sq>t see why you cannot do this politely without saying <dq>stop letting your kid be a brat.<dq> I would do the best you can to stay away from trying to give her advice. Who knows, maybe she secretly doesn<sq>t know what to do with the kid and when you bring this up she will unload on you and ask for help and you<sq>ll get to critique to your hearts content. But unwanted parenting advice is the kiss of death in parenting circles. What you and I think is a spoiled brat is to another parent a <dq>free spirit.<dq><br><br>Just do your best to protect your child and keep them away from this girl who is both hurting her and influencing her in a bad direction. If you spend any serious time with that kid, your child is bound to pick up many, many bad habits and I know that<sq>s not what you want. So do your best to avoid, be honest but polite in explaining why and continue to be a friend. And when they are playing together while you and your friend talk and the 10 yo does something to your child you don<sq>t like, tell her to stop. Protecting your kid is ok. If your kid starts copying the 10 yo in bad behavior, ask your friend to go home so your child can experience the punishment. Because what else can she do but learn what you want her to learn? <br><br>Eventually, this should work itself out. The 10 yo may not want you to babysit so much, the friend will realize they can<sq>t just let their kid run roughshod over a 5 yo and everyone can stay friends. (In a perfect world of course - good luck)</p>",

You can<sq>t just tell her what to do.  <br><br>You have to first ask if she wants to change.  Get her to agree to not interrupt you, then calmly outline your concerns.  Then ask her if she wants to change.  If she says no, then you tell her you have no obligation to help someone who doesn<sq>t want to help herself and that you<sq>ll be contacting her parents to collect her and you guys will be over.  <br><br>If she says yes, then you give her a pencil and notebook and have her list what she thinks are her most problematic behaviors and what she wants to change in her life.  Then you have her write down an action plan for each problem.  If she<sq>s really struggling, then you can feed her a few suggestions, but on the whole it has to be her doing.  She<sq>s depressed, not stupid- she will know the solutions to her problems.  Whether it be regulating her sleep schedule, or visiting her student advisor to review re-enrollment options, she is capable of recognizing the steps necessary to fix her problems, even if she lacks the motivation to execute them.  First hurdle is to list them out.  <br><br>Then over the course of the next weeks, you get her to prove she<sq>s helping herself.  If she actually proves it to you, give her a big hug and a kiss and let her know you<sq>re proud of her.  If depression is about the lack of a reward system, maybe you<sq>d have to step into that role temporarily.  My guess is things have likely been really tense and unresponsive between you guys lately, and your patience is running thin and you might be irritable.  Showing some affection in a time like this could be really encouraging for her and give her something to live for. <br><br>However, if she fails to take the steps she needs to take, you need to be prepared to leave her.  Having said all this, unless I had been with her for years and really enjoyed who she was, I wouldn<sq>t waste my time trying.  I<sq>d move on with my life and let her figure it out on her parent<sq>s dime. <br><br>TL;DR, guide her to solving her own problems, but kick her out if you don<sq>t see progress.  Making that consequence as clear as possible while still communicating your love and support is the trickiest part.

Anyway, one day I get a phone call when I<sq>m on my break from my friend, asking me if I<sq>ve taken some money out of a tin in her room. I said no, I didn<sq>t even know she had a money tin in her room. She said that shed come home, the backdoor was open and the toilet seat was up and the money had gone. I didnt and never had a back door key, her boyfriend did. And I had to say something, I was being accused of stealing from her when every peice of evidence showed it was her chap. It turned into something horrible and I had to move out, she was so blinded by her love for him. Being best friends with someone can feel like an invinsable bond, but it can be broken especially if the other thinks your going to ruin a romance. <br><br>All the best to all of you.

I hang out with my friends and I can come home with some amusing drama or new ideas.

                "answer": "<p>Real advice<colon><br>The need to control someone often stems from the *allowance* of control. Often times, this is developed in the beginning of a relationship when two people are learning to first coexist with one another, learning what each other<sq>s limits are, and what boundaries need to be set before taking steps further. In the beginning of a relationship, the two lovebirds are often trying to impress one another, and in so doing, they allow certain things that they may not allow normally, and excuse certain behaviors that they might not actually approve of.<br><br>From the way it sounds, your girlfriend completely loves you (I mean, I read her thread, obviously), and she<sq>s worked hard to not only impress you, but to show you that she loves you. And it seems that it<sq>s worked, because otherwise, you wouldn<sq>t be here admitting that she really is giving you 100<percent>.<br><br>Now, being a submissive female who enjoys making her boyfriend happy myself, for me, it means giving up a lot of the things that make me *me*, and instead, bowing to his will because I want him to be happy. I<sq>ve compromised on so many things just to please him, because his happiness is *my* happiness. But ultimately, some of the things that I<sq>ve compromised on have made me unhappy as well. The unfortunate side effect of this is that he unknowingly abuses the control I<sq>ve allotted for him because I<sq>m too afraid to set the boundaries myself. And in times where I *have* tried to set boundaries by voicing my opinion, it<sq>s started massive fights (yes, my boyfriend is controlling as well).<br><br>What I<sq>m saying is, your girlfriend has been conditioned to feel that anytime she speaks her mind about her side of the situation, she will be lectured, yelled at, or worse, abandoned (which you don<sq>t seem to be threatening, thank God, because my SO does that all the time). This sort of behavior is fucking POISONOUS to a relationship.<br><br>True, one person can be more dominant than the other. But in accepting and taking dominance in the relationship, you must also CARE for the more submissive half, and respect her feelings/needs/wants. Everyone has BASIC relationship needs, and of those needs, I<sq>m sure that for ALL relationships, TRUST is absolutely key.<br><br>I<sq>d suggest trust-building exercises.<br>You can probably Google a few, but for me, doing things like reading my emails in front of my SO, or checking texts openly in front of my SO, or surfing Facebook messages with my SO there was always helpful -- showing him I had nothing to hide. Also, every time I would go to an outing, I would let my boyfriend know he is more than welcome to join me, although it would be nice if I could have some alone time with my friends as well. I *always* invite him to wherever I go just to make him feel comfortable. And if I<sq>m out and about without him and he can<sq>t make it, I be sure to check in with him, send pictures, remind him I miss him, etc.<br><br>And while all of that might sound ridiculous, sometimes that<sq>s what needs to happen for someone to develop trust. It<sq>s worked for him, to the point where he understands I truly do not want anyone else, and to the point where he knows I am 100<percent> dedicated to him. We still have our problems, yes, but at least the trust is developing.<br><br>I truly hope things go well with you and your girlfriend.<br>I know how hard this can be.<br>I, too, love my SO from the bottom of my heart, and the fights we go through just absolutely WRECK me. I<sq>m glad you both have a place like Reddit where you can get advice or outside perspective -- and I don<sq>t actually want drama to happen. Sorry for saying that earlier. -__-<dq></p>",

Even if you don<sq>t feel like this was the case, these are his feelings and they have to be addressed.  Let him know you never intended to force him into anything, but you do need intimacy.  You don<sq>t want to beg for it every time.  You want to feel desired.<br><br>Finally, you have to talk about the cheating.  It<sq>s up to your husband to determine whether you were right or wrong.  My opinion doesn<sq>t matter.  If he can<sq>t ever forgive you for this, then the marriage isn<sq>t going to work.

That is inexcusable.  It may sting for a while, but friends are long-run.  Friendships are not mutually exclusive and the fact that your former chums are  treating you as an outsider indicates lack of social skill or maturity. <br><br>People tend to change over time. What was the most important thing a year ago is kind of silly now. Who was the most important person in your life a year ago is maybe not as important as they used to be?  Friendships are dynamic and contextual.    <br><br>I think the trick for you is to recognize that you will be or are already the <dq>new<dq> person in another new friendship.  That is the way friendships work. If your new friend(s) start acting catty about the person who was insightful enough to introduce you to them, be cool and recognize that being friends is not and will never be mutually exclusive.  I be inclusive of the introducer and expand your circle of friends to be complex, interactive and include many people.<br><br>The big bonus will be that when your new circle of friends is growing because you<sq>re not being elitist a-hole like your old friends, I wouldn<sq>t be one bit surprised to have one or the both of your former mates come back to you when their little <dq>gang<dq> falls apart.

The court may order her to inpatient treatment for her addiction in order to see the kids, in which case they would wait to go forward with your divorce. You may be better off drawing up some kind of agreement and getting her to sign it, but if it<sq>s too heavy-handed or one-sided she will challenge it later and could potentially win based on her current problems. <br><br>If you<sq>re getting the 6 kids, you will get the house as well.

Emphasize the emergency situation, and see if they have any recommendations on how to proceed. Then cancel all your credit cards. Talk to your bank as well, telling them that you<sq>ve been hacked, and again, ask for their recommendations on how to proceed (asking everyone gives you more information, is a way of documenting how you proceed, and gives you the opportunity to ask *them* to do some of it). Remember, through all this ( T_ T ) you<sq>re not using your personal computer or any passworded accounts.<br><br>Then! From a public computer, change all your passwords. Start with email.

Because not all women find it pleasant and personally it makes me gag and sick to my stomach. Wanting variety and desire back in your sex life is totally understandable and I hope you find some good advice to help you with that. But if you are really so petty to think cuming in her mouth is the most important part of the oral sex experience, then quite honestly you may be pushing her away with this single argument and being more of the problem than you think. I thought marriage was about understanding and compromise on both parties parts. If she really hates the taste of cum or just doesn<sq>t want to swallow, find some middle ground. Cum on her chest or something, or suggest she spit it out and have a glass of water ready for her. As for the emotional stuff, I really do hope you are able to find a solution to that.</p>",

I was very clear with him that I did not care if the stones were diamonds or even if they were real stones of any kind (in fact, I preferred fake because of the cost), but that I have man hands and I look terrible in dainty rings. He showed his chosen ring to my closest friends and my mom and they all told him it was not a good choice for me, but he loved the style and was very attached to it. He bought it anyway. I was so happy when he proposed, but I hated the ring and I hated myself for hating it. I thought it looked bad on me. When you get engaged as a women, all attention is on your ring. If you don<sq>t initially love it, it can be hard to get past because people keep focusing on it. Now, I am not saying the your fiancee<sq>s reaction is completely analogous to mine, but you may want to ask her why she wants a larger ring. Maybe she doesn<sq>t like the style of the ring and does not understand that a 1 CT stone would not be much larger. She might not be the materialistic bitch everyone is making her out to be (or maybe she is- finding out now is crucial). Have a talk with her and tell her that her vocal criticism of the ring you worked so hard for and we<sq>re so proud to give her is really hurtful to you, but that you want to understand why she is so disappointed.</p>",

As you are now seeing, there are more victims to rape than just the person who it physically happened to. It sounds like this anger Jim is holding is a toxic entity that will continue his downward spiral, even if he doesn<sq>t realize it or won<sq>t admit it. That stubbornness is common at his age. <br><br>If you can<sq>t afford to send him to professional help, then look for cheaper or free options. Support groups, depression hotlines, trauma hotlines, mental health associations. They are out there, you just need to look. He needs to speak to someone unbiased. The pastor is a start, but unfortunately they generally aren<sq>t trained to deal with this level of emotional damage. <br><br>You should be talking to Jim about this and encouraging him to do this. You also shouldn<sq>t support any inappropriate actions on his part. Violence against them, for example, should result in you stepping away - maybe permanently. He would be showing you that he is incapable of coping and has unhealthy and toxic responses. You should not be with him until he gets that under control. <br><br>**Second**<br><br>You can continue to help him by getting your own help. Dedicate a minimum of 2-3 nights per week to being away from him. Use this time to focus on your own recovery of the situation as well as spending time with your friends. Show him what a healthy person is. Encourage him to get friends. <br><br>Allowing this dependency to grow will only escalate the problems you are already seeing. You need to put an end to that immediately for both of your sake. <br><br>Likewise, learn to control your drinking so that you aren<sq>t getting yourself to the point where you aren<sq>t capable of conscious enough to make decisions. <br><br>**Third**<br><br>You don<sq>t have to press charges, but you should. Even a police report would be the right thing to do. Be honest with the police and let them know you don<sq>t have any evidence behind this, but that you just want to make them aware in case anyone else comes out. <br><br>Anything you can do to help make this situation aware so that others don<sq>t have this happen is a good thing. It might also help your boyfriend start to wrap his head around what happened if you are taking it as seriously as he is, or thinks you should.</p>",

This is when I learned 1/3 of pregnancies fail, and family and friends came out of the woodwork to support my sister by telling her how they have had miscarriages as well. Some women get 2-3-4-5 even before they have a successful birth. So fuck your boyfriend for being a douchebag and a scumbag. It sounds like he is kind of a piece of shit boyfriend, for both not supporting you and then having the gall to actually say he<sq>s grossed out by your body now. Fuck him, the relationship sounds pretty terrible, and you should probably be happy you didn<sq>t have a baby with such an emotionally unsupportive ass hole.</p>",

The fact that your boyfriend is completely disregarding your feelings, needs, and desires.<br><br>This problem is a common one, and can arise in any number of ways.

For example, he might say <dq>here is my facebook password - login and take a peek around anytime you like<dq>.

First off, it<sq>s very normal to be wondering about this. I remember when I was a couple of months out I made a profile on a dating site to see what was out there. I found it pretty terrifying and I deleted the account. On days when the grief wasn<sq>t so bad, I would also venture into the dating section of the widower forums to read about the trials and tribulations of widows and widowers re-entering the dating scene.<br><br>I think everyone here just wants to make sure you deal with the grief right now as the priority.<br><br>*how do i move forward?* Slowly. Sigmund Freud wrote a long treatise on grief. He says it can manifest itself like it was a mental illness but it should not be treated. One just has to go through it. In the words of Robert Frost <sq>the best way out is through<sq>.<br><br>The first six months can be like a form of shock, and then it gets really bad again after that (not like the first weeks of hell though). For many people the grief and mood-swings are really bad for the first year.<br><br>*is every woman i meet from here on out going to be measured against her?* Not if you don<sq>t want them to be. I<sq>ve seen many people who have lost someone who end up with a partner who also has personal experience with grief (I did too). It helps if the other person understands. I have also heard a story of a couple where the deceased SO was like a third presence in the relationship and it created problems. But many people are able to move on. From reading other stories from grieving SOs, I think the suicide part is going to be the difficult part for you to get past. I don<sq>t know your circumstances though. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Ok so I was in your position... my boyfriend picked up League about a year and a half ago.  He started playing with our roomates/friends (guys) and it slowly took more and more time.  It got to the point where one night I broke down and crying, told him I wanted him to play less because I wasn<sq>t having any fun sitting there watching him play, and like you said in your post, he wasn<sq>t much of a conversationalist while he was playing.  But I also said I felt bad because asking him to play less was like asking him to hang out with his friends less.  <br><br>The place where this differs (but I still have advice to offer you) is that he took that to heart and started playing less, but it was still a little much for me.  This is when I asked him to teach me how to play... he was so excited about this that he bought me a computer to play on because mine wasn<sq>t handling the game well.  <br><br>So I<sq>ve been playing with him for about a year now.  I say this is something you should consider for two reasons<colon><br><br>1.  I was able to participate with him and it<sq>s been a lot of fun!  And it made him happy to see me involved in something he enjoys.  So the times he plays I can get involved.<br><br>2.  By playing with him, when I<sq>ve had enough I can say <dq>Ok, I<sq>m done.  Let<sq>s go do something else!<dq>  And he<sq>s a lot more eager than he was before I started playing with him.  <br><br>So perhaps try asking him to teach you?  It can become a fun activity for you to do together, and then perhaps he will be more inclined to do activities *YOU* want since you<sq>ve been playing with him.   If that doesn<sq>t work... then I<sq>m not sure what other advice to give.  <br><br>Since pretty much all my male friends play LoL, I can tell you from experience that I<sq>ve seen many of their relationships end because of the game.  Even if they don<sq>t play too much, then they talk about it too much... I am one of two girls that haven<sq>t broken up with our SO<sq>s because of it, and we both started dating our SO<sq>s before they picked up the game.  My other friend doesn<sq>t play LoL at all and that is something she and her bf still fight about a lot.  My boyfriend and I have not had any issues about the game since I started playing with him.  <br><br>I hope things work out for you, I<sq>m sure his addiction is hurting all his loved ones.  </p>",

Manipulative, immature, selfish, and entitled also come to mind. <br><br>Here<sq>s what I suggest<colon><br><br>Stand with your feet apart about twice the width of your shoulders. Turn your feet out 45 degrees. Bend your knees 45 degrees. Now shake your hips side to side pretty quickly. <br><br>When you do that, do you feel anything moving between your legs. If so, then that means you have balls. In that case, use them. Here<sq>s a couple of options as to how<colon><br><br>1. Break up with her because you now realize she is treating you like shit and your relationship is heavily one sided. She is not only condoning disrespect towards you from her friend, but she is encouraging it. This doesn<sq>t improve, and breaking up and finding someone with more respect is how you deal with people like her. <br><br>2. Tell your girlfriend the following changes need to happen if you are going to remain in a relationship<colon><br><br>* If you see each other 5 times per week, she needs to come to you 2 times one week and 3 times the next. It needs to be equal. If that means she hops on a bus or gets a better job to afford a taxi, that<sq>s on her. <br><br>* She needs to stop trashing you to her friends that she expects you to spend time with. <br><br>* She needs to (transparently to you) defend the relationship when one of her friends disrespects it in the extreme way that friend did. <br><br>* She needs to woo you equally as much as you woo her. If that means she plans a date every second time, so be it. Whatever you two decide is <dq>woo<sq>ing<dq> each other, you split that responsibility down the middle. It should not be solely you, or even mostly you doing that. <br><br>* Not sure if this is the case, but considering your other points I wouldn<sq>t doubt it. She needs to pay her fair share towards dates and expenses you two pick up. It sounds like she is taking advantage of you, and that needs to stop.<br><br>* Last but not least, if she doesn<sq>t want to have sex or cuddle because she is using it as a tool to get what she wants from you, the relationship needs to end immediately. <br><br>I would personally go with option 1. </p>",

Don<sq>t. <br><br>Take this time and space and figure out what it is you want for yourself, from her and from the relationship. Write it all out. If you want 2-3 nights per week of alone time, or want to be treated with respect and not verbally abused. <br><br>Once you<sq>ve figured out what you want, write down possible solutions. Taking a few nights alone per week is simple. Not being abused the way she has been doing is a little more involved and could even involve her going to anger management or some other type of therapy to help her overcome whatever issues or missing skills that are causing her to act that way. <br><br>Once you have all of that figured out, sit her down and talk to her. Get a sitter for your daughter for the evening and remove any other distractions (i.e. TV off, etc...). Then make sure you both remain calm during this. If you get upset, take a short break before continuing where you left off. <br><br>In this talk, explain to her what it is you want from her and the relationship. Tell her how you plan on achieving those things. Be open to compromise if she offers that. Just make sure it is something you are happy with. <br><br>Then, most importantly, tell her that you will not tolerate her speaking to you the way she has. Then stick to it. If she insults or condescends you, remove yourself from the situation. Keep doing that. Make it very clear that when she acts in a negative way, your response will be to remove yourself. Make her know that she needs to apologize for acting that way, not you. Do that by telling her during this conversation and then not apologizing when it is her who is being unrealistic. <br><br>The lack of communication also seems to be an issue, and you two need to learn how to talk to each other like adults and work through problems the way adults would. Both of you should research and make efforts to do this. A counselor would help, but it is possible on your own. Just make sure it isn<sq>t just you putting in the effort here.

You were implying that sex was expected of him by serving the meal in lingerie. Then you forced the situation by starting oral sex. He then was forced to say no. He probably already feels guilty about his reduction in sexual desire. So having to say no would amplify that feeling.

Probably not, unless you continued to force him to comply with the oral sex after he said no. <br><br>Was it pressure? Yes.

My girlfriend is like you a lot, and I have a lot of trouble with just listening and comforting and not trying to solve her problems.  So I<sq>ll tell you exactly what<sq>s going through your girlfriend<sq>s mind when this happens.<br><br>You probably have problems that have been ongoing - i.e. your financial issues and unemployment.  And these have probably been consistent stressors in your life for some time.  And you<sq>ve probably come to her about how you feel about these problems on multiple occasions.<br><br>First, she wants to help you because it makes her feel bad that *you<sq>re* feeling bad, so she wants to help you solve your problems so you don<sq>t feel bad.  This is why she tries to offer solutions and advice, which may or may not come out as snarky responses and/or nagging.<br><br>Second, and don<sq>t take offense to this, but she<sq>s probably sick of hearing about your problems and feels like you aren<sq>t doing much (or enough) to solve them.  So after a while she just doesn<sq>t even want to hear about your problems, and doesn<sq>t think that you deserve empathy because in her mind you<sq>re just sitting there wringing your hands going <dq>woe is me<dq> and not trying to solve them.<br><br>So she wants to help you solve your problems, because it hurts her to see you like this, but doesn<sq>t think you ever listen to her when she offers help or advice to try to improve your situation, which is absolutely infuriating to her and why she resorts to nagging and making snarky comments.  Because of this, she feels like you aren<sq>t really genuinely interested in solving your own problems, and so instead of comforting you when you feel bad, she basically gets annoyed with you because she<sq>s thinking <dq>great, here we go again, another whine fest about problems he doesn<sq>t even want to try to solve<dq>.

Because to her, if you can<sq>t even be bothered to work towards solving these problems in your life, why would you work towards anything else?  Further, even if she wanted to support you in these goals, she<sq>d have no way to, because you<sq>ve made it clear to her (in her mind) that you don<sq>t value her contribution.  Which all leads into this<colon><br><br>>Well when I tell her what I need as you suggest, she gets upset and tells me I should just write her a script. So, what do I do in that situation?<br><br>She responds this way because you don<sq>t listen to her anyways, so she<sq>ll say whatever you want because to her it doesn<sq>t really matter anymore as she doesn<sq>t think you listen to her anyways, and also because in these situations she<sq>s so annoyed with you that she can<sq>t possibly offer genuine empathy.<br><br>Anyways, this is all written from her perspective so I<sq>m not trying to lambaste you personally.  I know how difficult it is to be in her situation, though.  Her biggest problem with the dynamic you two have going on here is that you<sq>re not listening to her when she feels like she<sq>s genuinely trying to help you; you ignore what she<sq>s saying because, as you say, that<sq>s not what you need at the moment.  But you have to realize that that<sq>s what she<sq>s offering.  And while it might not be what you need at the moment, you need to start communicating to her that you<sq>ll start listening to her and take her contributions into consideration.  You need to establish the respect of listening to one another before she can genuinely show you empathy.  Get her more involved in helping you solve your problems when you<sq>re *not* in a situation that just requires being comforted.  She<sq>ll feel much more valued then, and will feel like a teammate in these struggles, and will be more open to comforting you because she<sq>ll feel that you<sq>re genuinely invested in solving these problems.<br><br>Sit her down, when you<sq>re not having a breakdown, and say to her <dq>Here are my problems.  These are really stressing me out, and I<sq>m trying to solve them but I<sq>d like your help on how to go about doing that.  What do you think I should do?<dq><br><br>It<sq>s going to be tough, though, because she already has a hard time respecting the effort you<sq>re putting into solving them.  Involving her will help, but it might lead to some discussions down the line about her thinking you should do more than you already are.  And who knows, maybe she<sq>s right, but maybe she<sq>s not.  She has to respect your decisions, too.  But first you have to learn to listen to one another.</p>",

The fact that you<sq>re telling her openly what her actions do to you and make you feel, and she<sq>s blowing you off, should speak volumes to you.  Abusers feed on this.  She<sq>s making you feel like shit for being a victim, which in turn further victimizes you.  She<sq>s physically abusing you, then belittling you emotionally.  IT<sq>S NOT RIGHT.<br><br>I spent 4 or 5 years with my ex-wife.  The abuse escalated slowly over time.  I<sq>ve always been the kind of guy who would never, ever strike a woman.  I don<sq>t even resort to name-calling.  I actually did the same things you<sq>re describing - pushing her away, restraining her arms.  Those are defense mechanisms.  You<sq>re not being the aggressor.  You<sq>re not attacking her.  You<sq>re defending yourself from an incoming attack.  YOU ARE NOT ABUSING HER.  <br><br>I finally had what I call a <dq>wakeup moment<dq>.  My ex was having one of her rages, throwing punches at me left and right and I snapped.  I<sq>m a big guy (like 6<sq>4<dq>, 225lbs) and in the middle of it, I just put my guard down.  She landed a surprisingly strong punch to my face, and I turned into somebody I never knew I was even capable of being.  I wrapped my hand around her throat and pushed her 10 feet back into a wall.  I said, <dq>If you hit me again, I<sq>m going to hit you back.  And you won<sq>t get up.<dq>  It pains me to even share this story because I<sq>m so embarrassed and ashamed that I ever did something like that.  Through years of therapy, I<sq>ve realized that it wasn<sq>t my fault and that I was pushed into that position, but still.  I never thought I could do that.  My point is - you<sq>re capable of a lot more than you realize when somebody you love is destroying the fiber of your being.  And that is what your wife is doing to you.<br><br>She needs help, and so do you.  It<sq>s really wrong that she<sq>s doing this to you.  Without some serious help, this will only get worse with time.  She<sq>s emotionally manipulating you.  I beg you to listen to me when I say this stuff to you... I can<sq>t tell you how much you sound like me.  And you know what?  I never found the strength to leave my marriage.  SHE left ME.  The only truly good thing she ever did for me, honestly.  And would you believe it, I was devastated when she did.  This woman who constantly hit me, told me she hated me, made me feel like shit about myself... I was the one who was hurt when *she* left.  <br><br>I apologize for the long-winded comment.  I don<sq>t have a TL;DR for you because I think it<sq>s all relevant.<br></p>",

She told me way too much (as in; details you don<sq>t want to know), while my father didn<sq>t know and was oblivious. I was really caught in the middle and when I told my father eventually, he did nothing. We never talked about it. It was simple; <br><br>- Me<colon> <dq>You know mom<sq>s cheating on you, right?<dq> <br>- Dad<colon> <dq>With [excolleague my mom was friends with]?<dq> <br>- Me<colon> <dq>No, with [married colleague].<dq> <br>- Dad<colon> <dq>Hm, not the one I expected.<dq><br>- Me<colon> <dq>Yeah, I know.<dq><br><br>That was it. It was never brought up again and it was that particular thing that still bothers me years later. Yeah, my mom cheated and we sure had our differences, but hey, it<sq>s not my relationship and my mom and I talked very honest and open about what happened years later, but at that point, while I was caught in the middle, suddenly I was shut out entirely. <br><br>Please, if your son knows what<sq>s going on, the best way to deal with this, for him, is to be honest and communicate with him. It probably took all his strenght to tell you and you can<sq>t shut him out like suddenly he<sq>s the bad guy. Communicate on what this means for you and even explain marriage and marriage problems where needed. <br><br>If you and your wife are fighting, or going to counseling, or end up getting a divorce, it<sq>s important for him and his understanding (either now or later on) what<sq>s happening right now. <br><br>My mom and I sure have had our differences, but I absolutely admire and love that despite everything, we were and still are able to talk about the how and what and what consequenses it had for us personally. While my father shut me out and gave me the feeling I was the bad kid for ruining his oblivious happiness, my mom<sq>s approach helped me understand (in the long run as well) that their relationship was just that; theirs. Between a husband and wife. And that it<sq>s normal to have problems (well, maybe not those problems, but in general - you get me). That marriage is one hell of a commitment and that people make mistakes, but that whatever happened between them as husband and wife, wouldn<sq>t affect my position as their daughter. <br><br>So, if you<sq>re going to confront your wife, please DO include your son. Not in a way that he gets <dq>blamed<dq>, but in a way that makes her realise there<sq>s another person that is now unwillingly involved in her escapades - that there<sq>s another person affected by this and by her carelessness. </p>",

Almost all of the companies that do this type of sales neglect to show just how hard it is for a lower person to make any real money. I remember researching Mary Kay and even with such a popular one I was shocked at the difficulty required to make any money. Even at their highest prize, that pink caddy, you need to MAINTAIN a certain income for them monthly.

So to me it all depends on what you and your GF want.<br><br>My wife and I take the opposite view.  I<sq>m older, in my early 40<sq>s, and she is in her late 20<sq>s.  I pay her way and she enjoys it, and that<sq>s just the way it is.  I always pay her way, and always have, even when we were dating.  On occasion, if **we invite** a friend or two out to a dinner/drinks/dancing, I will also pay for them.  In return, they often invite us out and then they pay when we go out next time.  In some ways it is kind of nice to know that they will invite us out for something different and it<sq>s on them.  It<sq>s also balanced, if we take them some place nice, they do too.  None of this $0.99 McDonalds BS as payback.  LOL<br><br>The difference is that I no longer want a wife who works 8 hours a day as well as my working 8 hours.  My first wife worked, and it was not worth it to me.  We<sq>d both work 8+ hours a day, then come home to a messy house, and we were both too tired to cook or clean, etc.  With my current wife, I work 8 hours and she makes breakfast, lunch (sometimes if I don<sq>t go out), and dinner.  She cleans she house, takes care of the dogs, does the laundry, and all that stuff.  When I am done with work we are free to spend our time together.  While I may be a little tired, that quickly goes away and we enjoy our social life.  When we have kids, the expectation is that she will also stay home and care for them instead of needing to pay for child care and all that entails.<br><br>Does that mean you have be like that, or can<sq>t do all you want to?  No, of course not.  For me, personally, I hated doing housework, so this seems to be a natural extension of what I want, my working and paying for everything, and she pays me back in other equitable ways.<br><br>And frankly, my wife enjoys being a housewife, so it works out great because we are on the same page.</p>",

Most adults know how to adult and the standard advice regarding chore dividing/charts, honest discussion, and so on works for those people.  <br><br>I<sq>ve come to learn over the course of my marriage that there are some grown-ass men & women who simply will not keep up a house, even to basic hygienic standards like washing dishes and taking out trash.  They just don<sq>t care.  You won<sq>t be able to shame her into changing.  All the arguing in the world won<sq>t make a fundamental part of her personality suddenly different.  <br><br>My advice<colon>  decide if you can accept this for the rest of your life.  **Decide if everything else about her is good enough that you can let the cleaning/laziness issues go.**   <br>Not everyone is willing or able to keep dishes from molding in the sink or to scrub out a bathtub and nothing will change that about them.  <br><br>If it<sq>s in your budget, get a maid service.  If that<sq>s not in your budget then you<sq>ll be doing the housework yourself.  All of it.  No reprieves.  I was in bed on oxycodone after a traumatic c-section caring for a 2 year old and a newborn  - this after 3 weeks of pre-eclampsia including a hospitalization, bloodwork every other day, and being 9 fucking months pregnant - and my husband did nothing to keep up the house during it because he wasn<sq>t willing or able to handle it.  <br><br>I accepted this part of my husband before we had kids.

Assurance that what you<sq>re doing is right and that the world isn<sq>t crazy. So yes, you<sq>ve figured out what you want to do. You know how you feel; shocked, hurt, betrayed, whatever. It<sq>s awful, it<sq>s life changing and unfortunately things are gonna be really awful for a time, but at least you know that this is over for you.  So confront her about it. It doesn<sq>t have to be angry, it doesn<sq>t have to be desperate. You have the facts and you have the power now. Just tell h you know and you<sq>re done. This is where it will get hard. She<sq>s gonna cry, she<sq>s gonna beg and plead. You<sq>re gonna want to comfort her. If you don<sq>t want her in your life anymore then don<sq>t comfort, don<sq>t support. Just lay it out there and leave. <br><br>As for the practical side of things, do you have a friend/realtive/coworker/etc you could crash with for a bit? Though you<sq>re the victim here I think it<sq>d be better for you to leave. It<sq>s easier that way. You can be away from that world entirely. You may have to couch surf for a short period of time but that can be extremely refreshing at a time like this (trust me, I<sq>ve had to do it before).<br><br>Lastly let me just say, don<sq>t feel bad about suffering and don<sq>t deny your grief. Be sad, confront your pain and then live life. You<sq>ve got a lot of years ahead of you and time will inevitably pass, so don<sq>t worry about moving on tomorrow, focus on yourself for now and move on when the time is right. Grieve, it<sq>s healthy. Then when you are done with grief, life will continue. <br><br>I don<sq>t know you at all but I<sq>m sending my best wishes to you. Life is shit sometimes but it<sq>s worth the effort. I hope I have helped even in the slightest. Take care</p>",
