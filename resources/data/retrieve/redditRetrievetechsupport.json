                "answer": "<p>I want to clarify the story.  I was on the way home from the Super Bowl at a bar in Houston.  I was not drinking as my first day of my new job was today.  I was driving through a residential area when I got clipped by someone.  I spun out, hit a curb and lost my right back tire.  No airbags, but I bounced my head around pretty good.  The police showed up along with a lot of very nice people.  The cop there checked me out and recommended that I go on the ambulance.  He asked if I had been drinking, I said no, and asked if he wanted to test me out.  He did not.  I got to the hospital laying there for 2 hours when I decided that I wanted to go.  I have Uber and I was refusing all treatment asking to leave.  The doc wanted to give me a CT Scan, but I did not want to spend the money on it as I was currently uninsured (new job and new insurance today).  I said I was refusing all treatment and I wanted to leave.  The video is of me standing at my door asking the staff to let me leave as I was coherent and able to answer all of their questions, and had a ride home.  They had 2 sheriffs there for whatever reason and when they saw I was recording my request they all attacked, one dude put his knee into my eye socket and had me strapped to the bed while they force drew blood from me.  The thing is, in Texas, you need to be legally arrested and be served a search warrant to have your blood drawn.  They did not.  The police refused to act on the assault and after the analyzed the blood they let me walk out.  One of the nurses grabbed my phone and deleted my video.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Good post. I<sq>d like to add a few things, if I may. I owned computer stores for about 6 years and have fixed thousands of computers. In addition, we did onsite tech support and the things I<sq>ve learned over the years made my life much easier, so without further ado<colon><br><br>1. Build confidence 1st<colon> When you show up, make sure you look like someone they<sq>d be happy to let in their house. If you have long hair, make sure it<sq>s neat. If you have facial piercings, take them out. Wear khakis and a polo shirt. This may all seem like bullshit, but let<sq>s be honest, much of your customer base will be older and frankly, they will be instantly prejudiced against someone who looks like what they consider to be a thug. Be confident and comforting. *LISTEN* to them. The more time you spend letting them tell you about what happened with the computer, the better prepared you<sq>ll be to deal with it. With that said, keep the conversation focused on the computer. You<sq>re there to help them out, not hear about their cat. Don<sq>t accept coffee, tea, cookies, or anything like that. You want to appear professional. Your tools should be organized and clean. <br><br>2. Work quickly and tell them what you<sq>re doing, while you<sq>re doing it. Explain every facet of your work. If it<sq>s a hardware issue, explain what you<sq>re doing and why.<br><br>3. Bring paperwork. Before you TOUCH their computer, have them sign a form that indemnifies you from any damage. You<sq>re working on a system that<sq>s broken, so write on the form specifically what<sq>s wrong, note what actions you<sq>re taking to fix them, and have them sign both before and after you<sq>re done. The first signature is to show they<sq>re authorizing you to work on it, the second to document that they<sq>re satisfied. This will help you on rework claims.<br><br>4. Before you do a data transfer or a virus removal, make sure you explain the risks. People don<sq>t like to do this, but it<sq>s critical. About 1 in 1000 times, a hard drive will fail during a virus removal. The reason is that most hard drives aren<sq>t stressed that hard during normal use and you<sq>ll be working on systems that are 10+ years old sometimes. If you<sq>re doing a wipe/reload, make sure everything they want is transferred. <br><br>5. Test, test, test. Before you tell a customer they need a new computer, test the hell out of it. It<sq>s easy to show the customer a screen with a bunch of red indicating their drive is hosed. It<sq>s hard to simply tell them they lost gram-grams only photos.<br><br>6. Learn to troubleshoot quickly and accurately. This comes from practice but you can help yourself by bringing along the right tools. Also, check out this flowchart. It<sq>s pretty good. http<colon>//www.fonerbooks.com/poster.pdf<br><br>7. Bring good tools. They are, in no particular order -- Power Supply Tester, electric screwdriver with torque control, extra screws, Hirens disk, extra SATA cable, extra IDE cable, Flash drive, air compressor (canned air can suffice in a pinch, but you<sq>ll run into some ungodly filthy computers that require more power), windex, paper towels, a notebook computer, and an external hard drive enclosure.<br><br>8. Understand that you aren<sq>t there to fix their computer -- you<sq>re there to solve a problem. Figure out what that problem is 1st, fix their computer second. Ex. Let<sq>s say they can<sq>t get internet access and they<sq>re frantic. Find out *why* they<sq>re frantic. Sometimes the issue is they have to send out a critical email, maybe they need a special document for school, or whatever. You need to be able to offer creative solutions if their system is hosed.<br><br>9. After you<sq>ve fixed their computer, MAKE SURE THEY USE IT AND CAN VALIDATE THAT THE PROBLEM THEY HAD IS GONE. I can<sq>t stress this highly enough. Let them sit down and play with the system for a few minutes. This will give them more confidence in you, your work, and their newly fixed system.<br><br>10. Give bad news gently. If their mobo is bad, show them the swollen or leaking caps (if they are there). If their hard drive is clicking, let them hear it, tell them their options (send off for recovery, etc.). Make sure they know that it wasn<sq>t their fault. If their system is riddled with spyware, leave them a sheet with common ways to avoid getting it in the future. Be kind but firm. Remember, you<sq>ve already shown them the tests that indicate *why* something failed, so it shouldn<sq>t come as a shock.<br><br>11. Prepare them before you start. When they say, <dq>My hard drive won<sq>t turn on,<dq> you tell them that when a system won<sq>t start up, there are many reasons -- some are simple to fix, some are complex, but you will walk them through the process, every step of the way. If you suspect their hard drive is bad, tell them that you<sq>re concerned about it, but you<sq>re going to check it out to make sure. Don<sq>t work in quiet, then tell them, <dq>Yeah, it<sq>s dead. Everything is gone.<dq><br><br>12. When you<sq>re done and they<sq>re satisfied, tape your business card to their computer and tell them that you<sq>re available if they have any more questions. <br><br>13. Bring extra parts. There<sq>s no reason not to have an extra 450+ watt power supply, molex splitters, cables, and RAM with you at all times. It<sq>s an easy sale.<br><br>14. Sell upgrades. If you get to someone<sq>s house and they only have 512mb of RAM, bump it up by a GB, then let them see the difference.<br><br>15. Don<sq>t forget to tune it up. MSCONFIG is your friend, but remember to make sure every function they did before still works. Too many people disable all sorts of services but forget to re-enable the printer ones. You don<sq>t want angry calls that require you to go back.<br><br>16. Clean their computer screen and keyboard for them. This may seem stupid, but it<sq>s critical. Most of the work you<sq>re doing can<sq>t be seen -- it<sq>s just a bunch of keystrokes. If you clean up their computer, it looks better and they<sq>ll feel better about it. When I take my car in, the dealer washes it before they give it back, and even if it<sq>s a simple brake job, I feel better about the whole thing. The idea is, you<sq>re providing VALUE, not just emergency service. Which brings me to the last piece...<br><br>17. Don<sq>t apologize for charging them. You have a skill set they don<sq>t. You came to their house, you solved their problem, and you are worth what you charge, so don<sq>t be embarrassed. On the other hand, don<sq>t nickel and dime them. When you suspect what the problem is, give them a high range and a low range of how much it might cost. EX<colon> <dq>Ma<sq>am, your system won<sq>t turn on (don<sq>t say boot up) so there are a few things that might be wrong with it. If it<sq>s the power supply, it<sq>s just going to be $59 to fix and I have a replacement one in the car. If the motherboard is bad, that can run hundreds of dollars and it might be worthwhile to replace the system, but let<sq>s test it out and I<sq>ll be able to recommend the most cost effective solution.<dq> By setting their expectations, you prepare them for the worst. When it<sq>s just a power supply and their computer is up and running again, you have a happy customer.<br><br>18. Ok, I lied. One mroe thing -- give value. Let<sq>s say you fixed their power supply. Tune up their system too. Check their antivirus subscriptions. Check their RAM usage. Check their disk fragmentation (I like Iobit<sq>s tool as well as Acronix<sq>s, but to each his own). You want them to feel like they got a bargain because they called you and you want them to tell all their friends about you. It<sq>s not enough that you repaired their computer. You need to *fix their problem* and do it quickly, professionally, and inexpensively. <br><br>If you do this, your business will grow quickly and you<sq>ll have awesome customers.<br><br>Oh, one last thing -- you can<sq>t please everyone. Some people will be horrible to you no matter what, so don<sq>t fret. Cut them loose, leave, and don<sq>t bother with them again. You<sq>re doing everything you can to protect yourself by having them sign papers, by being friendly, and by knowing your shit, but there are people out there who will try to fuck you over, just because they suck.<br><br>Anyway, hope this helps. I could write a book about this (actually, I did, but it<sq>s under my real name) but this should help you get started.</p>",

Had the displeasure of trying to go through them for personal support on products like Office and Windows phones.<br><br>I typically get a feel for how a company is structured as this happens.  Some companies are engineered in a way that customer support is connected<colon> I<sq>ve dealt with Apple before and their rep can take a ticket to the actual IOS engineers and get an answer.<br><br>Being an employee with Microsoft means coming in every day, sitting in your cubicle and not knowing what your job is, what anyone else is doing and hoping nobody notices _you don<sq>t know how to do anything_.  They<sq>re compartmentalized from other divisions and can<sq>t get info or pass issues to anyone who matters.  These guys are literally the dumbest of the dumb, but that<sq>s what happens when you outsource to India and probably pay shit wages.<br><br>It actually terrifies me from a security standpoint how their first response to everything is trying to remote into people<sq>s systems.  Last time I had to deal with them was over a Hotmail account, and got the usual speech about how she needed to remote in.  I don<sq>t allow them access, ever, and they act like it<sq>s insane that I went off script and said <dq>no<dq>.<br><br>She tried to direct me to run msconfig, at which point I stop her and say <dq>That has nothing to do with anything.  _I know_ what msconfig does; I don<sq>t think _you_ know what it does.<dq>  If I had allowed her remote, she was going to play with my boot settings over an account issue?  Seriously?<br><br>I got one of those calls the other day from the scam that cold calls people purporting to be from Microsoft.  It<sq>s no wonder this has been so successful because they<sq>re doing the same thing Microsoft does.  Same way MS needed to push Win10 to everyone and took up crapware tactics to do it.  We try to educate people to beware these flags and MS comes along and emulates them.<br><br>Half my job is security in computers and internet.  I tell everyone<colon> when they ask to remote in, DO NOT ALLOW IT.  Require their tech instruct you on how to enter the commands so you can be the firewall against something that might harm you.  This stranger<sq>s only authority is they receive a paycheck from a mega corporation and I strongly advise against trusting them because of it.  Do you think Microsoft would ever accept accountability if their low level employee causes a larger issue either maliciously or through incompetence?<br><br>But again, that<sq>s how they<sq>ve structured it.  Nobody in the company has to take responsibility for anything.  You<sq>ll never talk to anyone who matters.  There<sq>s nobody to report to and no accountability for employees.  They<sq>re the perfect example of a company that only relates to the rest of the world through metrics.  I<sq>ve banged my head against that wall trying to get product and software support.

Basically you need to check your service order claim sheet and check the appearance section. This is what you signed off your laptop looked like prior to sending it to the service center. If there is any variation the service center absolutely has to note it in the system or they could be held liable for damage during shipping. Your best bet is calling the physical corporate building and discussing these discrepancies. The decision on the hinge repair is up to your manufacturer. Best buy does not warranty these products and follows manufacturer guidelines for repairs. If you had purchased a protection plan from best buy the company itself would have covered it. However corporate may help you out due to what seems to be shipping damage. </p>",

You<sq>ve been in there at least twice and this is your third time.<br><br>If the drive needs an operating system because it<sq>s the only drive in the laptop, they will need to install the OS on the new drive. If you are able to do it yourself and you have the proper installation media, it will likely be faster for you to do it yourself.<br><br>Geek Squad is no longer allowed to keep disk images of operating systems in the store or in file format anymore. This means if they install any OS in the store, it<sq>s a new OS purchased or given to you from off the shelf. Since Windows 10 is likely the only OS they sell in any of the stores, you<sq>d be getting Windows 10.<br><br>It<sq>s unlikely they will give you the OS, but there are circumstances they may eat the cost. If your laptop does not officially support Windows 10, you may have trouble with drivers, especially Wifi and they may tell you Windows 10 will not work right. They would be partially correct in this.<br><br>If they try telling you they will need to ship the laptop off to have the hard drive replaced and OS installed, this could take more than a few days. If they are able to order a hard drive with OS pre-installed, this will also take time.<br><br>If you have already waited long enough, you can tell them you cannot wait any more and that you need the issue resolved as soon as possible.<br><br>It is definitely in their power to make an exception for you, eat the cost of a new hard drive off the shelf, eat the cost of the OS and eat the cost of time it takes for a technician to put in your hard drive + install Windows 10 in the same day if you go in early enough.<br><br>If they are extremely busy and/or understaffed, you might be waiting until the next day.<br><br>The question is<colon> will they?

The point where the agents that you spoke to are getting confused at is that they believe you are referring to wanting your original (failed) hard drive back instead of your secondary (personal property) drive.  On that note they are correct in the fact that once a hard drive gets replaced under GSP it becomes the property of the company.<br><br>In fact you<sq>re pretty lucky that the service center called you at all since we used to tell customers <sq>I can send it out but I CANNOT assure you that your data is coming back, please backup on your own or through us<sq> and still get hell when they didn<sq>t back up and low and behold their computer comes back with a brand new HDD and all of their stuff is gone.  TBH I asked every client if they had any extra RAM/hardware or accessories on their comp before we shipped it just because we had a few of these issues (fucksake how many logtiech wireless dongles didn;t come back).<br><br>I can<sq>t really speak to how they reinstalled your W7 because it can vary if the service center did it or the precinct may have done it, but either way that<sq>s a pretty retarded way to reinstall the OS.  And about the stealing hardware etc, the person stealing from a customer computer is kind of unheard of on a store level since a lot of internal theft would rather opt to steal brand new stuff that<sq>s on the shelves since the penalty is the same anyway.  From what I understand the service center guys are pretty heavily monitored but that wasn<sq>t my area so I can<sq>t really speak for it. RAM? lol we had a shitload of <sq>tester<sq> ram that got stripped from any <sq>store used<sq> computer (not the IBMs, just computers <sq>used<sq> by the store for live demos etc) that was being junked (like enough to fill a mobo sized static bag easy).<br><br>TL<colon>DR Service center shenanigans + probably inexperienced agents = don<sq>t send out personal equipment with your shit with bestbuy.<br><br><br><br>P.S.

The only thing that might be corrupted is whatever file the drive was handling at the moment it was disconnected.  If it was idle then everything on the drive should be shiney.  <br>  <br>The first thing I would do is find a partition recovery tool for Mac.  It shouldn<sq>t be hard to find a few free demo or trial versions.  The sudden disconnect may have borked the partition which is why the drive isn<sq>t detected anymore.  Imagine all your backed up data is in a single book and your brother took that book and scribbled on the front so that you can<sq>t read it anymore.  Now imagine that you<sq>re a computer and when you see this newly-mangled book you think, <dq>Well, I can<sq>t read the cover so I<sq>m going to assume there<sq>s nothing inside there.<dq>  That<sq><sq>s a little like what I think has happened to your drive.  A partition tool can repair this kind of damage.  <br><br>I just did some Googling and apparently Mac comes with a disk utility.

If it detects the drive use the First Aid option and see if it is able to repair the partition.  Be very careful before you start any other operations with this utility.  <br>  <br>If the utility doesn<sq>t detect the drive then it<sq>s time to look for a different solution.  <br>  <br>**[edit]**  <br>I see some replies urging OP to use RAID or cloud storage to avoid this.  Imho I wouldn<sq>t use either.  With cloud storage you<sq>re giving up control of your data to gain the *expectation* that it will always be available.  I don<sq>t mean <sq>big brother<sq> control, I mean that your data could become unavailable at any moment for reasons beyond your control and it may become unavailable at a crucial moment or it may vanish forever.  The hosting company could go under and take down their servers without notice.  The cloud drive(s) holding your data could fail for a variety of reasons or be ruined by a natural disaster or poor maintenance or whatever other natural or human-caused mess could happen and you won<sq>t know that anything is wrong until you try to get into your account and your browser starts laughing at you.  And finally you could lose your internet connection for an extended period.  I<sq>m not arguing to not use cloud storage at all.  I<sq>m saying to not use it exclusively.<br>  <br>RAID is more defensible but as a casual user I<sq>m still not a fan.  It<sq>s complex to set up, the drives are always on and it<sq>s relatively expensive.  One of my build goals that I finally accomplished last year was to rid my case of HDDs.  But I didn<sq>t toss my old drives.  I turned them into offline storage/backup.  <br>  <br>http<colon>//imgur.com/a/sINvj  <br>  <br>That<sq>s an external dock and two 4TB HDDs.  Both drives are storage; I use another one for music and software and then another for Steam backup so if something happens to my games drives I won<sq>t have to spend an eternity re-downloading everything.  When I want to use a drive, whether to add to it or watch/use something on it, I connect the dock, plug the drive into the dock and then switch on the power.  When I<sq>m done I unmount the drive, switch off the dock power and then put both the dock and the drive in the bags they came in and put them on a shelf.  My data is always literally within reach and nothing short of a power failure can cut me off from it.  <br>The dock<sq>s bag keeps dust out, the HDDs<sq> bags keep dust out and offer anti-static protection.  The drives themselves don<sq>t go more than a few months at most between uses.  They are no longer being repeatedly spun up and then parked when I turn my computer on or when some Windows<sq> service like search indexer or whatever else kicks in.  The drives aren<sq>t inactive for so long that I have to worry much about atrophy but I certainly have reduced their wear and tear to a fraction of what it was.  I<sq>m hoping to see some spectacular shelf life from them.  <br>The dock cost about $35CDN after tax.  HDD prices have finally started dropping after a 6 year spike.  If you<sq>re a casual user who wants a simple and affordable solution that you can be confident about, this is the best setup I know of.  <br>  <br>I don<sq>t use external drives because every time you buy a drive you<sq>re buying a dock as well.  I only need one dock so some chunk of every external drive purchase would be throwing money away.  I also see power users in tech forums warning people about reliability problems, although that may just be elitist snobbery.  I<sq>m happy with what I<sq>ve got and I<sq>ll keep doing it until I have a good reason to stop.  <br>  <br>**[edit2] Ignore this paragraph.  Turns out it<sq>s a myth.**  <br>Also, if you decide to try this make sure to store your HDDs on an edge (just like you should be doing with CDs, DVDs and blu-rays).  Disks that are sitting on a spindle for long periods will slowly droop around that spindle.  A disk that isn<sq>t flat is a disk that can<sq>t be read properly.  Also known as junk.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Everybody has their favorites and that<sq>s great if they work.<br><br>-  Malwarebytes is almost universally recommended, and with good reason.  It<sq>s definitely on my list.<br><br>-  I still recommend and use AVG Free.  If you choose the correct custom install options and are willing to configure it post installation, it<sq>s not invasive, is fairly light on resources (not as good as it used to be though), and just as effective as any other definitions-based AV.  The rootkit scanning tool is actually quite good in my experience.  In addition, even if you don<sq>t like AVG, they do provide the AVG Rescue CD for free, which can help you out of a bind if the system is non-bootable.  It<sq>s got decent tools to make registry edits, test RAM, and control services.<br><br>-  Spybot Search and Destroy has tried to make itself into a full-fledged piece of security software, which it fails at.  It<sq>s very intrusive and not geared toward the average user.  What is still great about Spybot is the Immunization feature, and the ability to scan non-active registry hives, even those present on external disks (or any other non-active partition).  To this day I get several calls a year from users saying <sq>Such and such message just appeared telling me that X website is unsafe.<sq>  They are almost always going to online poker (or some other gambling), warez/pirated software link aggregation sites, or *occasionally* some porn sites run by scammers.  Immunization really does make a difference (especially the hosts file blacklisting), and it<sq>s easy enough to turn off all the other features of Spybot that want to run in the background.<br><br>-  I see this recommended so rarely I wonder if it is the dark horse of anti-malware/spyware software<colon>  SuperAntiSpyware.  Yes the name is cheesy and the website is a little dated, but this program just plain works.  Not only is it a very good tool to clean systems up, it can readily help you neutralize both PUC<sq>s (potentially unwanted changes) and PUP<sq>s (potentially unwanted programs).  In addition, it offers some powerful repair tools for things like the TCP/IP stack and explorer shell, both of which can save you time in getting the machine working properly after a particularly nasty infection.<br><br>-  Hijack This is still useful, although I use it rarely.  I see someone else recommending a similar tool from M$, I<sq>ll be sure to check it out.<br><br>-  MSE/Windows Defender are used in situations where there was particularly bad malware.  No AV or anti-malware/spyware software cleans a machine 100<percent> by itself, and those few times when the combo of AVG, MBAM and SAS somehow continue to return positives after the first round of scans, Microsoft<sq>s solutions are an easy way to get another angle on the issue.<br><br>Once I know the machine is clean, of course there are the rounds of driver updates and Windows Updates, also you<sq>ll want to make sure that things like Flash and Java, and web browsers, MS Office/Open Office/Libre Office, and any critical user software (Quickbooks, Peachtree, Adobe CS, etc.) are all up to date.<br><br>What then?<br><br>It<sq>s optimization time, that<sq>s what!<br><br>-  Ccleaner is a time saver, and a good one at that.  You can do everything it does manually, but why bother?  Pair it up with ccenhancer and it becomes quite a bit more powerful as well.  The ability toremove buggy software from the Programs and Features (or Add/Remove for you XP diehards) list is nice, the registry cleanup is 99<percent> (not 100<percent>) reliable, and you can jettison unwanted startup items and browser extensions from one interface.<br><br>-  I don<sq>t like Auslogics BoostSpeed, it<sq>s a gimmick.  I do very much like two other pieces of software they make, however.  Those are Auslogics Disk Defrag and Auslogics Registry Defrag.  If you<sq>re fortunate enough to have an SSD, Disk Defrag will be of limited to no use to you.  If you<sq>re on a hard disk as your system disk or you have a lot of data stored on a hard disk as a non-active partition, it does it<sq>s job very well.  VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) compatible, and the ability to move system files to the inside tracks of your hard disk both make this utility a cut above other defrag software I<sq>ve used as far as the noticeable performance benefits you get out of that defrag.  For Registry Defrag, results are mixed.  Sometimes there are quite a few optimizations it can make (usually in older systems or systems with gobs of applications installed), which can reduce boot times and improve overall system responsiveness.  In other cases there<sq>s nothing for it to do because a particular user has a spartan view of PC use software-wise.  It<sq>s usefulness warrants the meager 6mb it inhabits on my flash drive by all accounts.<br><br>-  Disable Hibernation.  Just do it.  If you<sq>re on an SSD, set Sleep Mode to your liking.  If you<sq>re running from a hard disk, disable both.  Clearly notebooks and tablets will want to keep sleep enabled.<br><br>-  If you<sq>re on a desktop, disable any kind of link state or interval based power saving options for SATA, USB, and PCIe.  They aren<sq>t going to save you much power, and at worst you find your device doesn<sq>t like having the power cut and refuses to work until you reboot.<br><br>-  Disable Executive Paging.  At one time this was the single most noticeable <sq>tweak<sq> you could make to Windows to improve responsiveness.  In a fast system with an SSD, it<sq>s effects aren<sq>t very noticeable.  I still do it out of habit.<br><br>-  Disable QOS for your network adapters.  QOS is meant to juggle available bandwidth on your network, prioritizing certain kinds of traffic and slow others as needed.  Unless you have a lot of devices (more than 4) sharing wifi and trying to do bandwidth intensive tasks all the time, QOS won<sq>t help you.<br><br>-  Disable System Restore.  Delete all previous restore points.  Just turn that f*c<percent>e& off.  It harbors viruses and malware (or portions of them), it rarely provides a solution to any meaningful problem, and it lulls end users into a false sense of security in believing they have a magic reset button or a backup.  System Restore is neither.  Not only this, but it eats up (sometimes very limited and valuable) disk space, as well as what is very precious disk I/O if you<sq>re on a standard hard disk.  Driver rollbacks have their place, but that<sq>s nothing you can<sq>t do manually almost as quickly.  Registry backups aren<sq>t a bad idea by any means, but they don<sq>t do much on their own.  Real men make backups.  Be a real man, turn this junk off and make a backup.<br><br>-  I<sq>m sure everyone knows this, but disable unnecessary startup items.  In addition, it is quite safe to trim unnecessary third-party services as well.  Did you just install an HP Laserjet for someone<sq>s home office for a single machine?  HP doesn<sq>t need to phone home, offer printer ink purchases, or any kind of updates to the user.  Leave the printer driver running, turn the rest of the junk off.  Adobe Update Manager and Java Quickstarter are very safely disabled as well.<br><br>-  Turn off Windows Write-Buffer Flushing.  If you don<sq>t know what that is, check your hard disk in Device Manager.<br><br>-  Make sure you have the latest BIOS!  Especially in notebooks, an updated BIOS can mean more battery life, a cooling/quieter running system, and sometimes enhanced compatibility and stability.  There are almost never downsides to updating the BIOS, as long as the power doesn<sq>t go out...<br><br>-  If it<sq>s an older system, configure the BIOS to make sure that the Parallel port is set to ECP mode w/DMA.  Make sure USB 2.0 is configured correctly.  Make sure AHCI is enabled for SATA disks and that IDE disks are using the highest UDMA mode available.  There are other things that can enhance performance to small degrees as well, but these are the three that make the biggest difference if you<sq>re dealing with some ancient P4 or similar.<br><br>-  Disable indexing of your hard disks.  Windows search is good, and it<sq>s not slow w/o indexing.  Indexing just adds overhead to the pathetic seeks times of a hard disk.  Turn it off, the small but constant junk of performance that you get back is worth it.  On a fast SSD system, you won<sq>t see a difference.<br><br>-  Finally, clean that machine!  CPU<sq>s throttle with heat, GPU<sq>s throttle with heat, PSU<sq>s die with heat, etc.  Dust and lint buildup helps trap heat in the system.  A cool system is a happy system.<br><br>I keep a rather large flash drive loaded with these tools and gobs and gobs more stuff like service packs, codecs, some commonly used third party apps, hardware probing/testing, etc.  PM if you<sq>d like a complete list of the **Tools of the Computer Gods v3.11 Second Edition Service Pack6a**.<br><br>*Edit - Content<colon>  <br>Disable any and all network adapters when doing your virus/malware scans.

Removing the Virus is very simple and Malwarebytes can do this as can many of other AV<sq>s out there. Removing the encryption though isn<sq>t possible and the files are unrecoverable as it creates a Public and Private Key, the latter is created and stored on the C&C Server.<br><br>You can opt to pay via BitCoin to decrypt the data, after which the CryptoLocker writer/s will send you a decryption key (Private Key) to decrypt your data. The Private Key is created on the C&C server, whilst the public key resides in your registry. Without the Private Key, there is no way to recover the files. There have been people that have stumped up and paid to get their files back, but you really have to weigh the cost of the data against the price that the decryption key now costs. I believe that some of the people that actually paid, had data that far outweighed the cost of getting the Private Key, and did so as a last resort. I would definitely recommend NOT paying the ransom. Last time I looked at the price that the virus writers were charging for the Private Key (Decryption Key) it was 10BTC, which equates to $8,373.00 (USD) at the current exchange price.<br><br>That said, you mentioned in the comments below that he already has the data backed up, so I would do a complete Clean Install.<br><br>When you have re-installed for him, one of the first things I would install is a decent AV and Malwarebytes (preferably Pro)<br><br>Also, I would download and install the [CryptoPrevent Tool](http<colon>//www.foolishit.com/vb6-projects/cryptoprevent/) that was written by Nick Shaw of FoolishIT.com.

It is responsible for taking the high voltage mains power from your wall outlet and transforming it into the low voltage DC that your computer requires.  Without electricity, your computer would be useless, but the importance of quality power supplies are often overlooked by the end user.<br><br>The reason for this is simple<colon><br><br>*When a power supply is doing its job then the user should never have to know it is there.*<br><br>Unlike RAM, storage space, CPU cycles, etc, a power supply should operate transparently from the time it is installed until the time the computer becomes obsolete.  Unfortunately because of this transparent nature many users do not put much thought into their PSU, and thus problems ranging from intermittent errors to catastrophic cascading hardware failures resulting from inadequate or mediocre PSUs occur, and are often misdiagnosed.<br><br>Remember - if your PSU is causing your problems, then swapping out other components during troubleshooting will not only be a waste of time, but you may end up with an even larger stack of dead parts as they get damaged by the faulty power unit.<br><br>**Section 2<colon> Common Misunderstandings Regarding Computer Power Supplies**<br><br>1. Advertised wattage ratings are a good indicator of PSU capability and/or quality<br>2. If a power supply is faulty or underpowered then the system will simply not power on and/or the problem will be obvious<br>3. Power supplies with identical advertised specifications are equally good<br><br>*Regarding misunderstanding #1<colon>* <br><br>In order to understand why wattage is a poor indicator of actual PSU capability one must first learn a very important electrical rule called <dq>Joule<sq>s Law<dq>.  Don<sq>t worry, it is easy.<br><br>Power (watts) = Voltage * Amps<br><br>This means that wattage, which is the overall power, is directly proportional to voltage and current (amps).<br><br>Since there are many interdependent components inside of computers which rely on different voltages to run, and require different amounts of power, then the power supply must be able to not only convert power from the wall outlet but also split this power into different voltage <sq>rails<sq> of different power capability.   <br><br>Let us create a make-believe and simplistic (ideal) power supply.  This supply has a 12V rail capable of 10A, a 5V rail capable of 5A, and a 3.3V rail capable of 1A.  We will ignore negative rails for simplicity. This gives us a total power capability of<colon><br><br>P(watts) = (12V * 10A) + (5V * 5A) + (3.3V * 1A) <br>P = 148.3watts <br><br>However, this does not mean that all 148.3W are available to all components.  For instance, only 120W total is available on the 12V rail, and even if the other rails are barely utilized all of the 12V devices are limited to 120Watts total regardless of the total power capability of the unit.<br><br>Another key factor making wattage ratings misleading is that power output can be highly variable outside of ideal conditions.  Due to poor component choices, poor quality, and poor design, many power supplies become increasingly unable to output their <sq>rated<sq> power once temperatures and/or loads start to rise.  Since increasing temperature results in lower ability to supply stable power to components, as well as increasing power requirements of the components themselves, it is easy to see how a <sq>high wattage<sq> but poor quality PSU would result in instability and possibly hardware failures when a user attempts to run the supply at its rated power.<br><br>*Regarding misunderstanding #2<colon>* <br><br>Power supply problems often lead to misdiagnosis during troubleshooting because they manifest themselves as errors in other components.<br><br>*Regarding misunderstanding #3<colon>*<br><br>Build quality, internal component quality, and design are the most important aspects of a good power supply.  It is much more important to get a reliable power supply than to get a bigger power supply.  <br><br>Most power supply brands are simply repackaged units that have been sourced from a large manufacturer and cosmetically altered.  Thus, a different model PSU from the same brand may be made by a completely different manufacturer and be of entirely different quality than others by the same brand.  A google search for your make and model PSU and the letters <sq>OEM<sq> will often reveal which manufacturer made the unit if it is a rebranded unit.<br><br>**Section 3<colon> I have a dodgy/suspicious PSU in my system.

                "answer": "<p>#**How to know if you need more RAM**<br><br>*(I originally posted this here<colon> https<colon>//slickdeals.net/f/4922990-how-to-know-if-you-need-more-ram?v=1).  I made a few edits below<colon>*<br><br>There is a very simple & quick way of seeing if you actually are running low on RAM before over-buying or not seeing the results you were hoping to.  There<sq>s a misconception that adding RAM makes a machine faster - this is not true UNLESS the machine needs more RAM than is already installed.  Adding RAM to a machine that isn<sq>t already using it all does nothing whatsoever.<br><br>So first, use your computer! Fire it up and launch all of the apps that you generally have going. Open a few browser tabs, get your email going, etc. Try to do an average session - don<sq>t open every app on your machine. In the example below, this is my laptop that<sq>s running Outlook, IE with several tabs, Chrome with several tabs, Notepad, Windows Explorer, a couple of chat apps, Dropbox and Snag-It.  Then<colon><br><br> - Launch Task Manager (ctrl-alt-del & then <sq>start task manager<sq>; OR right click task bar at the bottom of your screen and <sq>start task manager<sq>)<br><br> - Switch to the <sq>Performance<sq> tab<br>Click the <sq>Resource Monitor...<sq> button at the bottom of the window, and [it will pop up a window that looks like this](https<colon>//i.imgur.com/BcNuu.jpg).<br><br>There are 5 different sections of memory usage on the bar graph, but only 3 of them are really important to you.<br><br>The first one (in grey) is hardware reserved - this is RAM that hardware uses & there<sq>s nothing you can do about this, so not important. This amount will generally be pretty low.  (A high amount of RAM here usually indicates that you<sq>ve got more than 4GB in a 32-bit machine)<br><br>The third one (in orange) is <sq>Modified<sq>. Also not very important because this amount is generally low, but this is RAM that<sq>s in use by low priority tasks that can be quickly released for other use.  <br><br>**The second section** (in green) is important - this is the total amount of physical RAM that your machine is currently using (ignoring the swap file). In the graphic linked above, the machine is using 3GB of RAM.<br><br>**The forth section** (in dark blue, labeled <sq>Standby<sq>) is also important.  This section is actually not labeled well, as this is your free or available RAM. This is memory that<sq>s available for use by whatever application needs it next. In this example, there<sq>s 3GB of RAM just waiting to be used.<br><br>Finally, **the fifth section** (in light blue, labeled <sq>Free<sq>) - this one is also kind of misleading, as this is more like wasted RAM, not free RAM. The memory in this section is the amount that Windows is just ignoring because it has no use for it. It<sq>s not being used & it<sq>s not ready to be used by anything - it<sq>s just sitting there doing nothing.<br><br>So, if someone were to show me this display & ask if they need more RAM I<sq>d say no, as a matter of fact you have more installed than the machine is using. In this example the machine is only actually using 3GB with another 3GB on standby, and 2GB doing nothing at all. As it<sq>s running now, having 4GB in the machine would be fine, and having 6GB would give it a safety buffer. It<sq>s got 8GB installed (see the line highlighted in yellow), so 2GB is <sq>wasted<sq> because Windows simply has no use for it.  Adding more RAM to a machine like this would be nothing but a waste of money.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>This is confusing.  Let me make you more confused.<br><br>There are many Intel CPUs.  <br><br>The original IBM PC 5150 in 1981 had an Intel 8088.  This was a 16-bit CPU.  It ran DOS.<br><br>A later model was the 80286.  This was also 16-bit CPU, with a few extra features and the ability to work with more RAM.  It was a separate type of CPU than the 8088, but booted up in a mode compatible with the 8088.  It still ran DOS.<br><br>Then, the 80386.  Intel<sq>s first 32-bit CPU.  The 80386 had all the full mechanisms necessary to properly run a modern, secure multitasking operating system with two <dq>levels<dq> - a <dq>kernel<dq> or system mode and a <dq>user<dq> or normal program mode.  Normal programs cannot mess with the system mode (blocked by hardware) unless system mode allows it.  This is everything Windows NT and derivatives (like XP, Vista, 7, etc.), or Linux, or BSD, or any modern operating system needs.<br><br>It booted up in a mode compatible with 8088 still, so it could still run DOS.<br><br>Everything since the 386 built on the 386.  So that<sq>s why `i386` has become a general name for <dq>32-bit Intel CPU<dq> - the implication is that it<sq>s compatible with the i386 or later.  The first time I heard `i386` was in connection with Debian Linux (which dates back to 1993?) but the earliest versions of Windows NT 4.0 worked on multiple architectures (like MIPS), and I386 was used there to refer to stuff that would run on Intel CPUs as well.<br><br>When 64-bit came around, Intel wanted to do things a different way, with its new Itanium chip.  This was called IA-64.  Some Intel documentation refers to 32-bit Intel stuff as IA-32 as a result (that could actually probably go back further than when the Itanium came out, though).  <br><br>The Itanium flopped, and AMD decided to extend the i386 architecture into a 64-bit version, rather than break off and make a new architecture like Intel tried.  Debian Linux called this `amd64` - not sure if that came from something previously, or if everyone started doing that when Debian did that.  Intel<sq>s name for this was EM64T.  But most Windows stuff, since Vista at least, uses `x64` to refer to that.  I don<sq>t know who at WIndows decided chose that but it stuck in a lot of Windows documentation.  Intel hasn<sq>t used the x86 nomenclature to refer to CPUs since possibly the Pentium and definitely not since the Core line.<br><br>So - i386 / IA-32 / x86 = 32bit, and EM64T / amd64 / x64 = 64bit, and IA-64 = Itanium, which you won<sq>t see in a desktop system (well, there ARE desktop systems with this CPU it turns out).<br><br>Interestingly the 64-bit CPUs still boot up in the original 8088 mode for compatibility, just in case you want to run DOS on your 8-core 3.0GHz new CPU with enough on-die cache to dwarf many systems of the early to mid 80<sq>s.<br><br>(Intel also had been making CPUs long before the 8088, like the 8086, the 8080 - an 8-bit CPU, and their first single-chip CPU, the 4004 - a 4-bit CPU)<br><br>EDIT<colon> Corrections per Syde80, hunterkll and UncleTogie<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>http<colon>//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tech_support_cheat_sheet.png<br><br>I<sq>ve been in various positions of tech support for about 15 years now, and I generally enjoy fixing other people<sq>s computer problems. If it<sq>s the sort of thing you enjoy doing, then by all means, be the go-to fixit guy.<br><br>I really think that there are some things you should be aware of, though.<br><br>First and foremost, fixing someone<sq>s computer is a really good way to end up married to that computer.  By that I mean that there are some people who, if you touch their computer once, not only will you be asked to fix any and everything that goes wrong from now until the end of time, you are also likely to be blamed for anything that goes wrong, too.  You might think that you<sq>re just replacing a bad video card, but from their point of view, you are working black magick, and wielding forbidden knowledge not meant for mortals.  So six months from now when their hard drive suddenly goes bad, or they end up with a boatload of spyware, it will somehow be your fault.  <dq>IT WAS FINE UNTIL YOU WORKED ON IT.<dq><br><br>Second, you<sq>re not always going to know right away what the problem is.  You have to do basic troubleshooting, and a lot of that involves trial-and-error.  A machine that powers on but won<sq>t POST could have one of several common problems, or any combination of problems.  Sometimes the only thing you can realistically do is swap out components with known-good replacements until the problem is gone.  If you don<sq>t have a vast supply of test parts lying around (and unless you do this for a living, you probably don<sq>t).  This means that you<sq>re either going to have to tell the person that you don<sq>t know how to fix their problem (nearly always the safest choice, but if you<sq>re like me it will make you feel guilty), or you will take a dangerous guess and tell them they need to buy a new ______.  Due to Murphy<sq>s Law, that will always, always, always be the wrong part. Then you will look stupid and feel guilty.  Rinse and repeat until the problem is solved.<br><br>Third, some people think that because you successfully fixed the expensive computer they thought was totally broken and unfixable, destined for the landfill (all it needed was the HD reformatted and the OS reinstalled) then surely you must also know how to fix every single other device that uses electricity in any conceivable way.  TVs, microwave ovens, DVD players, vacuum cleaners, cars, copiers, MRI machines, whatever.  They will call you asking for help. When you tell them you can<sq>t help, they will assume you<sq>re feigning ignorance and blowing them off, because you<sq>re an asshole. You<sq>re Superman. Why wouldn<sq>t Superman help Lois Laine when she needs help? The only reason would be because he<sq>s an asshole.<br><br>And of course, all of the above only applies to the people closest to you.</p>",

The more subtle reason though is that it makes your router busy, and this is kind of important for understanding DDoS attacks not just on an individual, but on businesses and services as well.<br><br>A Router is just a computer.  If you give a router too much shit to do, it<sq>ll slow down.  Once you actually get to commercial grade routers, the major concern a network engineer has in purchasing is, <sq>how much shit am I asking my router to do<sq>.  A major difference between this [mid-grade sonicwall](http<colon>//www.sonicwall.com/us/en/products/NSA-2600.html) and [this hundred thousand dollar monstrosity](http<colon>//www.sonicwall.com/us/en/products/SuperMassive-E10000.html) is the CPU and Memory.  When you throw traffic at a router, it has to sort through it and direct that traffic to a location, or decide to drop or do something else with it.  If you throw enough traffic at it, the router won<sq>t be able to keep up and the end result is the exact same is a brute force attack that just clogs the pipes<colon>  Traffic is put into a queue and gaming goes to shit.<br><br>Not a lot of this applies to you directly, but it<sq>s important to understand what<sq>s happening so you can assess solutions effectively.<br><br>In your case, you are kind of fucked.<br><br>Individuals don<sq>t have a lot of bandwidth and definitely don<sq>t have the power to control what<sq>s coming into their network before it<sq>s too late.  The suggestion of talking to cloudflare might be your best bet.  Other than that, you might do well to buy a static IP that is on a totally different subnet in hopes to dodge your attackers.<br><br>A final note<colon>  99<percent> of the time someone thinks they are being DDoS<sq>d, they are not.  No one dedicates the resources to just drop the connect of some rando.  You are an exception since you are a personality and this is literally the first time someone said, <sq>I<sq>m being DDoS<sq>d!<sq> and believed it.  That said, it<sq>s still probably worth it to scrutinize your traffic going in and out to remove external variables.<br><br>Also, note to absolutely everyone ever who might ever be concerned about IP address privacy<colon>  Stop using Skype.

Following this i inserted the usb back into the machine i was previously trying to install windows onto and launched into the LIVE-OS (try Ubuntu from usb) and started the application [Gparted](https<colon>//apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gparted/) and followed /u/SnappyCrunch advice below<colon><br><br>>Once you<sq>ve created the USB drive and started your computer from it, click on <dq>Activities<dq> in the upper left, then type <dq>gparted<dq> in the search box.

If it<sq>s there, then select it, create a partition on it, format it as fat32, apply that, <br><br>Once that had worked out, I redownloaded the Windows installation media onto my usb (at this point i really wished i had 2 usbs) which took its time, once ready i launched back into windows installation and finally my SSD shows up as a 250GB active disk, which had a partition on it, i found this strange because surely if it had a partition it should show up right? Well apparently i think this is what had caused the issue in the first place a [corrupted](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/eJkEeVi.jpg) partition? Anyway being ecstatic that it was finally showing up i went back into my command prompt to make sure it was real (Shift + F10, diskpart -> list disk) and when i confirmed it was infact for shizzle, i went back to this beautiful thread and began following /u/Degru and his well descirbed sequence...<br><br>>Boot installer disk, press shift-f10, type the following.

If it still doesn<sq>t show up in the installer, try rebooting the installation media. Once it shows up in the installation media, then just delete the partition you created and tell it to install in the unallocated space.<br><br>By god its finally [working](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/PbzAmh9.jpg)!<br><br>after that was completed i was able to comfortably select my SSD as an installation location et VOILA!<br><br>I would again like to thank everyone for their help!</p>",

After changing things in their firewall and attempting to test it I was having trouble getting everything to work normally.  I turned up logging on the firewall so I could see what was going on and found the IP that appeared to be trying to hack the network hitting the firewall constantly.  the IP traced to Pennsylvania, nowhere near where I am or have ever been, and there were also other IPs from other places in and out of the state I am in (Alaska).  well, if you haven<sq>t already guessed... I opened a web browser on my phone and googled <dq>what is my ip<dq> so I could find it in the logs and found that the suspicious IP was mine.  so it appears AT&T is piping their traffic data to other sites, and of course, your public IP is going to show as whatever point it releases your traffic out to the internet.  so for whatever reason, AT&T was keeping my traffic in their network and routing it to Pennsylvania before finally letting it out to the internet.  My best guess was that their cell tower connects to their satellite, which then passes the data to one of their facilities elsewhere to reach the internet.  <br><br>it<sq>s most likely that your cell provider is doing something similar.  Change your password to be safe, but also check what IP your phone is using occasionally by googling what is my IP and see if that<sq>s the case.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As others have said, this is a potentially complex issue, and a 3rd party would most definitely be the best answer. But as you have come to us for help, I have outlined some basic steps as well as information about your problem so you can learn about it. I felt that you wouldn<sq>t have posted if you weren<sq>t interested to learn (as well as fix your problem). If this is the case, read on, if not, I<sq>d start Googling local network support.<br><br>To start off, there is a device on your network that has a process running called a DHCP Server. What this does is hands out DHCP leases to any device on your network that requests one. The DHCP lease contains 4 items<colon> an IP address, Netmask, Gateway IP and DNS IP. This is called a <sq>lease<sq> because it has a set time period on how long the device is allowed to use that information in the lease. The DHCP server will also have a copy of the information in the lease, and blocks out that IP that was given so someone else doesn<sq>t use it. The lease time is usually set to a long time (a few days) but if you have lots of devices coming and going, you would reduce this so you don<sq>t run out of available IP addresses. (Side note - you can also set a Static IP on a device so that device will always use the static (never-changing) information, rather than what the DHCP server leases it)<br><br>When you are doing a <sq>Renew Lease<sq>, all you are doing is asking the DHCP server if the lease you were using is still available, if so, renew it with the same details; if someone else has received that information when they requested a lease, your device will get the next sequential IP address (with the same Netmask, Gateway and DNS as before, these typically never change). What you are doing is doing no harm, but obviously there is an issue.<br><br>What you want to do is a process of elimination when someone loses internet. You want to see what you can still access. If you make a visualisation in your head of the network, typically it will look something like this<colon> CLIENT (device) > Wireless Access Point > Router > Internet. When someone loses access to the internet, you want to see if you can still access the Wireless Access point by pinging it. You will need to know it<sq>s IP address. In Terminal, type ping IPADDRESS (i.e. **ping 192.168.0.1**) and hit enter, this will start sending packets to that device. If it shows <sq>timed out<sq> or something along those lines, it means the packet isn<sq>t getting to the device, or the device isn<sq>t returning the packet. This is usually where your issue will lie. If you can successfully ping the access point, that<sq>s when you see if you can talk to the router (again, with it<sq>s IP address). Eventually you should get to a device that is just blocking access for whatever reason, then you go from there.<br><br>It may also be that there are two DHCP servers in the network, and they are conflicting. For example if both the Wireless Access Point **and** the router are DHCP servers, and one is giving out incorrect information, then when a device queries for a new lease (because the lease period is 1 day, for example), the wrong DHCP server responds with incorrect info. Then when you are manually hitting renew, this queries the right one and voila, you<sq>re online.<br><br>Feel free to post any questions about the above, or any process you<sq>re stuck with (getting IP addresses for example).</p>",

                "answer": "<p>GIFs are not really designed for video like they<sq>re used on /r/gifs.<br><br><br>We need to lay down some ground knowledge first.  Think of any motion picture as just that.... pictures designed to illustrate motion.  Each picture is shown one after the other at a high speed (24 to 60 per second).  Each individual picture is considered a *frame*.  To make this picture slideshow look like a movie, we need a minimum of 24 *frames per second*, or 24 pictures being displayed each second.<br><br>Most videos you watch have compression.  One of the more popular video compression methods is [Group of Pictures](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_pictures).  Without getting too technical, all you need to know is that the video itself doesn<sq>t store the full content of each frame.  Group of Picture uses an I-frame (think of this as a key frame, a full frame with full data) and then subsequent frames afterwards that only contain some data (IE only showing you what<sq>s changed).  If you<sq>ve ever seen a video on YouTube or your favourite media player glitch out where some splotches are green or black and random blocks change colours before the video goes back to normal, you<sq>ve seen the effects of GoP compression.  <br><br>A GIF doesn<sq>t understand any of that.  For a GIF to work, it needs the full content of each frame in the animation.  This is fine for simple 5 frame animation GIF, but not the large GIFs you see people trying to use.  That<sq>s why so many GIFs you see used for Internet memes are only a few seconds long.  A truly uncompressed video (.avi file, although even that extension is used for DivX compression) works in a somewhat similar manner (at least at a high level), and will eat up gigabytes worth of data in mere minutes.<br><br>Another interesting topic with GIFs is colour reproduction.  Each frame can only have a maximum of 256 colours (or an 8 bit palette map).  Unfortunately this causes colour banding and weird looking images (you need a 24-bit palette map to define *true* colour), but can be solved with [dithering](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither).  Dithering is why every gif you<sq>ve ever seen looks grainy.  The cat example in the linked article is fantastic.<br><br>As far as buffering... all of your videos actually buffer.  Buffering is the idea that the video loads a certain amount of time ahead before it starts playing the video.  With YouTube, the video may download a 5 second buffer before it starts playing.  The idea is that the rest of the video is downloading while you<sq>re watching it, allowing you to stream the video.  Buffering is the reason why you can watch a YouTube video immediately, but need to wait the full hour (or however long it takes) for a full torrented video to download before you can even begin watching it.<br><br>GIFs don<sq>t understand the concept of buffering or waiting until fully downloaded to play.  A GIF just stores the images, some information on the amount of delay tmie per frame, and the number of times to replay each frame (where 0 is unlimited, or loop... not part of the GIF file standard but introduced by Netscape years ago).  It will start displaying frames immediately.  If the next frame isn<sq>t available at the end of the delay time from the previous frame, the GIF will wait until the frame data is fully loaded and display it.  This is why the GIF will get stuck and move along choppily until it hits its first repeat.  By then the GIF frames are completely loaded and the animation can play correctly.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>There are three main methodologies - one of which you<sq>ve already mentioned. Starting from scratch by reformatting is sometimes the appropriate course of action, but not always. If the machine has an *actual* virus (file infector, macro, etc) such as Virut or Sality then a reformat should always be performed. Rootkits, bootkits and backdoor Trojans warrant consideration at the very least, however, it may depend on the purpose or function of the machine, and the owner<sq>s wishes. Nowadays, the importance of performing a reformat is diminishing due to security enhancements in the Windows OS. For example, kernel-mode rootkits such as TDL3, once very prevalent several years ago, are rarely seen nowadays due to security features such as Secure Boot and the forcing of signed kernel drivers in 64-bit Windows.<br><br>---<br><br>The second methodology is a scattergun approach. Run a whole myriad of malware removal programmes hoping something works. For simple issues involving adware and Potentially Unwanted Programmes (PUPs), which are not inherently malicious, this method will most likely prove sufficient. However, when dealing with more complex and sophisticated malware, this may not be sufficient, and require a diagnostic approach as explained below.<br><br>---<br><br>The third methodology is a systematic diagnostic approach, where the affected machine is diagnosed, a plan of action prepared and then implemented. This method is very much manual in the sense scriptable programmes are instructed to remove specific items (files, folders, registry keys/values, etc) with the use of a script or set of instructions. This is not something picked up straight off the bat, and requires training and an understanding of Windows components and constructs. [UNITE](http<colon>//uniteagainstmalware.com/), for example, is an organisation that offers such training. <br><br>---<br><br>That is not to say if you wish to remove malware you must partake in such training. But if your desire is to possess a more complete and proficient understanding in the art of malware removal, there is a lot more too it than simply running a whole host of programmes in a row.</p>",

A full cycle is one charge from 0<percent> to 100<percent>. A charge from 50<percent> to 100<percent> would be 1/2 cycle, and a charge from 90<percent> to 100<percent> would be 1/10 cycle. <br><br>Usually manufacturers guarantee that the battery will be good for 300 full cycles. <dq>Good<dq> meaning it will retain at least 80<percent> of it<sq>s charge when it was brand new. HP and maybe some other manufacturers offer *Long Life* batteries, which are good for 1000 cycles, but that<sq>s a different matter.<br><br>When you have your battery plugged in and the laptop is connected to power the battery doesn<sq>t stay charged at 100<percent> all the time because that is bad for the battery (it<sq>s lifespan shortens if it<sq>s constantly at 100<percent>). So the computer does a neat trick, where it lets the battery deplete and then charges the battery by a few <percent> constantly. You might sometimes notice your battery says it<sq>s at 95<percent> or 98<percent> even when you<sq>ve had it plugged in for hours. This is why.<br><br>These minimal 3-5<percent> charges all contribute to the total 100 full cycles of the battery lifespan. <br><br>Let<sq>s say the notebook does **1** 95<percent>-100<percent> charge per hour, that<sq>s 5<percent> of a full cycle. So in 20 hours the battery will do 1 full cycle even though your notebook was constantly connected to the mains. <br><br>Basically you<sq>re not harming the battery in any way by having it in your laptop constantly, but it does use up the battery<sq>s cycles. Because of this the battery<sq>s lifespan shortens.<br><br>EDIT<colon> made a mistake with manufacturer full cycles, it<sq>s more like 300 and 1000 from 100 and 300.</p>",

But, real-world performance is more likely going to favor Comcrap<sq>s 75Mbit connection most of the time anyway. <br><br>The way the cable system is laid out, everyone on a block or neighbourhood shares the same <sq>loop<sq> of coax, just with taps going off to deliver signal to each endpoint. This makes sense for television<colon> Everyone<sq>s watching the same thing anyway, so why not just connect customers to the same trunk line? <br><br>For cable Internet, they take a couple of TV stations worth of bandwidth and set it aside for Internet. The modems  on that loop have their own protocol that allows them to share this this bandwidth through either frequency or time division. As it is, the peak network throughput they sell you is quite a bit less than the maximum throughput that bandwidth could support. There<sq>s a total of around 300-500 Mbit/sec shared in that last loop for DOCSIS 3.0 modems. That<sq>s a reasonable amount, but there will not be quite enough to deliver the advertised speeds to everyone at the same time. The thing is, residential users are not all drawing peak throughput at the same time, which lets them get away with this over-provisioning most of the time. <br><br>Is AT&T any better about this? Probably not much. While their copper and fiber lines don<sq>t have the same technical restrictions, they *also* over-provision their throughput for residential customers. The only difference is where this happens. Nearly all ISPs can and do over-provision other links within their networks and the transport that they buy on other networks. They can all have a situation where the network starts to slow down when everyone tries to get the advertised throughput at the same time. <br><br>Overall, I<sq>d say that Comcast<sq>s advertised 75 Mbit/sec works out to more real-world throughput that AT&T<sq>s 18 Mbit/sec fiber-to-the curb system.

I hope people don<sq>t believe that Charter, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, and other various ISPs are just sitting around running Deep Packet Inspection on their own customers to see who is torrenting what. That is not how it works at all.<br><br>It<sq>s actually quite simple.<br><br>Say, as an example, a user decides to download the latest episode to Game of Thrones ([the single most pirated TV show](http<colon>//www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/04/15/game-of-thrones-sets-piracy-world-record-but-does-hbo-care/) to date). They go to their favorite tracker or indexer, grab the torrent or the magnet link, pop it into their client, and hit the start button.<br><br>Now, this torrent in question may have several thousand users in it actively seeding and leeching at anytime. The wonderful thing about torrents, however, is that you get (through what is known as an [announce](https<colon>//wiki.vuze.com/w/Announce)) a nice fun list from the tracker of the IP of __every single client__ in the swarm, active or not. [DHT](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT#BitTorrent_Protocol_Extension) makes things even more fun.<br><br>Now, say I<sq>m Time Warner (not to be confused with Time Warner Cable as they are two entirely separate entities), and I<sq>m not too happy about the mass piracy of my show. To me, this translates to [users who are not paying for my service](http<colon>//theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones).<br><br>What I may then do is retain the services of a law group for the purpose of identifying and targeting the persons who are sharing the files. Now the DMCA only applies to America, so I can only target American users (though they can also contact rights groups in other countries to exercise the laws on the books there).<br><br>Enter the firms who operate in this manner. Given the ability to act on their behalf as their legal representative, these firms then begin to [scrape trackers](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_scrape) for the number of peers on a given set of torrents (in this case, more recent episodes of Game of Thrones which are likely to have more users than older episodes). With a list of torrents that contain high volumes of users, they then begin to announce to the tracker, requesting a list of connected clients. They may even act as a peer themselves, and start downloading the files (and even seeding), or they may send junk data to other clients (which will individually block them after their data continues to fail hash checks, but not before their IP is already logged) whilst remaining in the swarm.<br><br>Once they have a logged a significant number of IPs, they then seek to determine the locations of them. Most torrent clients perform rudimentary GeoIP look-ups, but for the amount of numbers they<sq>re using, they may likely be performing GeoIP lookups en masse using a service such as that provided by [MaxMind](https<colon>//www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-services-and-databases). They then filter for all the USA clients, and may do some rDNS on the IPs to find out where they are registered - or they may look up the IP<sq>s whois registration en masse to find out the abuse contact that is listed (think of it as similar to the whois registration on an individual domain, but instead for a whole network).<br><br>At that point, once again, en masse, they start sending out automated notifications to the [abuse or DMCA point-of-contact](https<colon>//www.arin.net/knowledge/database.html) containing the time stamp, the torrent url, the page it was retrieved from, the tracker in question (or it<sq>s announce url), and the IP of the user, either in-line or with a form letter warning users to cease their activity. This is called an automated response.<br><br>At this point, the Network or Service Provider can do one of a few things. The most common are to either ignore the notice in entirety and send it to [circular filing](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_13), or they can forward the notification to their user who happened to have the IP assigned to them at a given time. The latter is the significantly more common response. This used to be the end of it [until the graduated response system came into effect](https<colon>//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/graduated-response-deal-steamrollers-towards-july-1-launch) as Rights Holders don<sq>t feel that ISPs are doing enough to police their networks ([Some have gone as far as to file FCC complaints for it](https<colon>//www.techdirt.com/articles/20070618/095112.shtml) - though that didn<sq>t go so well [in the land of Oz](http<colon>//arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/02/studios-crushed-isp-cant-be-forced-to-play-copyright-cop/), and demanded that ISPs kick off repeat pirates).<br><br>[Comcast, along with other<sq>s](https<colon>//torrentfreak.com/isp-six-strikes-anti-piracy-scheme-120803/), voluntarily joined that program. As part of Comcast<sq>s take on things, they perform the effective equivalent of a [Man-in-the-Middle attack](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) on the user in question, and will pester the user with notifications or flat out deny website access [until further action is taken](https<colon>//www.techdirt.com/articles/20130227/14231422143/comcast-we-wont-terminate-your-account-under-six-strikes-well-just-block-every-single-website.shtml).<br><br>Rarely, but in other cases, [some studios have chosen](http<colon>//arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/oscar-nominated-dallas-buyers-club-sues-31-over-bittorrent-downloads/) to actually pursue pirates in court ([though the success of this tactic has been even more rare](http<colon>//www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/30/hurt-locker-piracy-lawsuit-abandoned_n_1392427.html)). [Some other attempts](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_v._Tenenbaum), however, [have been more much more successful](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records,_Inc._v._Thomas-Rasset). Others go the route of [demanding users pay up or else](http<colon>//arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/meet-rightscorp-the-internets-new-for-profit-copyright-cop/).<br><br>I hope this helps to clear things up. No, your ISP is not watching you. But there are others who are.

                "answer": "<p>Find broken stuff and see if you can fix it. Ask first before you do anything, but if it<sq>s really broken and your company/boss has no intentions of fixing it go ahead and rip it apart. I have fixed a 24<dq> monitor that was going to be thrown away by taking it apart and finding a bad capacitor (which cost about 58 cents to replace) and now it<sq>s up and running again. We had a KVM from our server room gathering dust because the screen wouldn<sq>t turn on. I found a replacement inverter board for $80 online and switched them out and it worked fine. A replacement of the same model KVM would<sq>ve cost $1100. Doing small things like this that your boss doesn<sq>t have time for can either make you more valuable if you fix them correctly, or nothing bad will happen because you were using your free time to tinker, and the thing was broken to begin with. Get comfortable working on things that are broken and you<sq>ll be better prepared for when you need to work on a critical piece of equipment. Learn the little tricks, like when companies hide screws under labels, learn how much you can bend plastic before it snaps, learn how to keep you tools and screws and components organized so you aren<sq>t left with 5 extra screws after replacing a laptop motherboard (guilty). If you aren<sq>t familiar with building or working on PCs, start with a completely empty case and add each component and get used to how they interact with each other. If you already are familiar with hardware, then like /u/sxfvhn said, spin up some desktop OSs or even better server OSs and get familiar with them. Even better than that is to start playing with virtual machines, so you can put together a decent PC from the parts you have, and can install and configure hundreds of OSs (not at the same time, install/delete etc.) on a single PC without changing a single piece of hardware.</p>",

So if he was able to associate your steam username with a profile you might have somewhere else, i.e. you use the same profile name for your twitter or something. He might have been able to find your real name. Then using (most likely) Facebook he could search your name and confirm with the ip location which person is actually you (if you have a common name).

If your computer is just running slow, that<sq>s not even reason for them to care. How many people do you know who have had computers that run slow? It would be a waste of time for them to even try to address this even if they could somehow know. If the ISP really thought your computer was an issue to them, they would probably just disconnect you from the network and then wait for you to call in and talk to them about it. (or redirect your browser to a page that tells you to call them)<br><br>* **Microsoft error reports** - To the best of my knowledge, MS doesn<sq>t share these with anyone. They<sq>re just used internally to fix bugs. But even if they do travel outside of MS, I<sq>m sure that they<sq>re not going to some company that is going to call you up about them. They would at least remove your contact info so that said company wouldn<sq>t know who to call. If MS was doing this, there would be outrage and I<sq>m sure I would have read about it on reddit. <colon>)<br><br>* **His lack of specific knowledge about what computer he was referring to** - Keep in mind that any technical reports that someone might somehow have about your computers would not refer to them as a desktop or a laptop, or oldest or newest, or of course black or gray. He would have an address, such as an IP address or a MAC address or a computer name (which is not the make or model (though it could be the same)....right click on computer and select properties and half way down the page you<sq>ll see your computer<sq>s name.) But really, he shouldn<sq>t even know these details as they shouldn<sq>t be visible outside of your home network.

You are going to have to take the university campus method or WISP method to do what you are trying to do. <br><br>Your main backbone will be the bridged isp system you set up and you will have to set up the emitters from that base station (a tower or a high place). These can broadcasts anywhere from 1- 100km based on the type you choose. The receiver will intercept the signal and then pass it through a router where you can now use it as a regular Ethernet connection. At this point you will have about 5 - 6 receivers around the radius of your town and can now distribute the wifi through access points on the roofs of buildings. You can daisy chain the AP<sq>s from each other to achieve a web like effect to cover the greatest sector. You can set up client and bandwidth restrictions with the EdgeMax routers and EdgeOS software.<br><br>Take a look at the products offered by Ubiquity to see how you would attempt setting this up. https<colon>//www.ubnt.com/products/<br><br>a pic of what you are trying to do<colon> http<colon>//i.imgur.com/Vh0Nz1M.png<br><br>Its pretty costly and will require you to run ethernet between the APs to achieve what you want to do in a cost effective manner, with limited degradation of the speeds. <br><br>Ubiquity products are great and i use them in my home for multiple APs throughout the house. </p>",

With over 100k new malware variants seen daily, no single AV solution will be the silver bullet that prevents you from getting malware.<br><br>So while AV software is good to have, I wouldn<sq>t put too much emphasis on it alone.   Microsoft<sq>s Security Essentials (or Defender in Windows 8 and above) does a decent enough job.  With AV you<sq>re usually looking at the detection and removal side of threats, with prevention only for known signatures or behaviors.   Where you want to be is more on the prevention side of the security spectrum..and you want to do it in such a way that it doesn<sq>t degrade performance (like all-in-one AV solutions tend to do).   So where do you begin on prevention?  Here are some tips to get started<colon><br><br>- Reduce your main account<sq>s admin rights.   When malware kicks off it<sq>ll often run with the same privileges as the account you<sq>re logged under.  UAC can be defeated fairly easily so the best way around this is to simply operate as a standard user. (create a local admin account with a simple password, log into it, and convert your main account to a standard user).  From here if an application needs elevation, it will need to ask for admin credentials.  Done, you<sq>ve just reduced the threat of rootkits tremendously.<br><br>- Keep your PC up to date.  Since most malware depends on exploits to run, keeping your internet facing apps up to date is paramount.  Consider Secunia PSI to take care of patching the things Windows Updates cannot<colon> http<colon>//www.secunia.com/psi<br><br>- Use a site advisor.  These can come in handy to help steer you away from compromised sites...as well as prevent them from loading if redirected.  One I like to recommend is Web of Trust, although be sure with any site advisor to read the reasons why sites are flagged...as sometimes they can be incorrectly reported<colon> http<colon>//www.mywot.com<br><br>- Be wise with your browser.  Internet Explorer, while often picked on by fans of other browsers, is actually remarkably secure when used properly.  Make good use of the security zones by turning off Java and rarely used plugins for the standard <dq>internet zone<dq> and add sites you trust to the <dq>trusted zone.<dq> Chrome is also a fairly secure browser, with higher reports of vulnerabilities (CVEs) but a good track record on patching turnaround. (edit<colon> further discussion in a sub thread below on browser comparisons).   Mozilla FireFox, with no plans to sandbox, needs a little extra care when using.  Highly recommend NoScript with FireFox.<br><br>- Block malware behaviors.  Two really good hardening solutions are Microsoft<sq>s EMET and FoolishIT<sq>s Cryptoprevent.  EMET is a great malware mitigation toolkit when used properly, as it stops common malware exploit techniques rather than malware signatures.  Quite brilliantly actually as there are millions of malware in the wild, but only a handful of exploit behaviors. Cryptoprevent works in a different sense in that it blocks common exploit locations  if they happen to get past initial defenses (using Applocker rules)<colon> https<colon>//technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/jj653751 <br>http<colon>//www.foolishit.com/vb6-projects/cryptoprevent/<br><br>- Stay on top of what changes are occurring.

You<sq>ll most likely find that there are recurring issues that will take care of the bulk of your support calls.  Items that require training can be your easiest wins.<br>* Figure out how to track your support calls.  If it<sq>s a one man show, start simple before making a purchase decision.  Something as simple as an excel spreadsheet will work!<br>* What does your management want you to do?  Regardless of how great the stores think you are doing, if you aren<sq>t meeting your management<sq>s expectations, you may find that you are failing in their eyes.  I don<sq>t mean this to sound like a doom and gloom type of thing, but this is a simple item that people tend to forget to ask their management about when forming a new department.<br>* When you understand the scope of your role, get an inventory going of the equipment that falls within that scope.  <br>* If you are responsible for the underlying infrastructure (i.e. network), create a diagram of all networks and ensure you know all the devices that are connected to the network.  Also, get all the WAN circuit information together. This includes the carrier, who to call for outages, and the circuit IDs.<br>* The same above methodology of gathering information will be relevant to all items you are responsible for.  You<sq>ll save yourself a lot of heartache having this information handy.  Especially during an outage.<br>* Running an IT Department is not just about the technical aspects.  Being organized and communicating well are key.  It sounds like you have these two items covered, but don<sq>t forget them.<br>* Regarding your development, focus on the basics.  You<sq>ll get pretty far with basic items such as understanding your existing configuration, ping, traceroute, and basic troubleshooting of whatever clients you are running (windows, Mac, unix).  If the stores are small and the overall corporate network is small, who cares if you understand how to implement Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) if you<sq>re never going to use it.  Take a look at the <dq>for dummies<dq> books.  One thing I<sq>ve loved about that entire series is that they break it down into digestible pieces and explain things in english, not geek.<br>* Be transparent and consistently follow through!  Too many IT Departments are a black hole of information to their users.  Let them know what you<sq>re working on and give them reasonable time frames on when you<sq>ll get back to them.   If you find yourself not getting back to them in time, adjust accordingly and communicate that with them.  You<sq>d be surprised how forgiving users can be when you are up front with them.  <br>* Do you have a budget?  Do you have headcount?  Do you have to justify headcount?  Be realistic if you have to justify headcount.  If the company is small, you most likely aren<sq>t going to get a windows sys admin, a network engineer and a software support specialist.  This goes back to determining the scope of what you are responsible for and hiring from there.  BTW, from my experience you<sq>ll find that Sys Admins typically can pick up the required networking skills for a Small Medium Business (SMB).  Network engineers will typically find it more difficult to pick up the Sys Admin skills. While this is not always the rule, it certainly is the norm.<br>* Tied to the headcount piece, find some hands in the stores!  Just like you started out in your store, I<sq>m sure you<sq>ll find someone who has some technical aptitude that can help out.  You can even make it an official program that you can use to vet potential members of your team.  This will also possibly eliminate the need for you to travel to the sites for every little thing.<br><br>Sorry I couldn<sq>t put more, I<sq>m just finishing my lunch up and have a meeting to get to.

It is a good place to start and will teach you some basic enterprise level IT skills. <br>**EDIT** <br>Being the first to comment I wanted to add a little to this so mods please be gentle. One thing you must realize about IT as well is that, it is alot like being a mechanic. It<sq>s not always <dq>What you know<dq> as much as <dq>What you<sq>re willing to learn<dq>. You need to still keep up on your IT education. It never hurts to continue learning. <br> I have been in the field for about 15 years. I started in a small office environment. I was lucky to be recruited by a huge tech firm for a level 2 position. That firm was Perot Systems Corporation. I was selected as I had some Active Directory experience and plus had just taken an Active Directory course with cert. During my interview I solved a problem a satellite office was having. All due to the fact I had stayed up on my education. Perot saw the office where I worked had a lot of unused floor space and decided to put in a Level 1 Helpdesk operation there. I assisted in the build out and go live operations there. I did have to take some more company given education to help stand-up the project. A few years later and after a successful launch, Perot Systems was purchased by Dell and I was now a Dell Employee. The office I was in was a Healthcare IT office. Healthcare IT is a huge playing field to be in with a ton of opportunity. I was the senior tech in that facility and left after 6 years. I only left because I was recruited by a huge global firm, offered more money and a 5 minute commute. (Like I said, I am one of the lucky ones). The place where I now work was building a new IT team and had taken over IT operations for a Hospital. After I had been here a few months we were still looking for more people. Now this is important so listen up. No matter what field of IT you<sq>re in, knowing your shit is important because you never know who is going to walk through your door! I was at Staples looking for office supplies. At that time Staples had a small IT PC repair gig going. It was kinda like the Geek squad. Being in this field you always listen to what some retail IT techs say to customers. You get nosy and wonder if they know what they<sq>re talking about. A few of the techs there were BSing and upselling customers on stuff they didn<sq>t really need. Then I heard this one short, stocky, red-haired girl with some sense talking to a customer and pointing the customer in the direction I would have taken. I stopped in over the next few days when she was working, acted like I was shopping and listened to her interact with more people. This kid knew her stuff and was really good with customers. <br> The next week I told our onsite IT manager I may have someone who would be perfect for the team, as we were still looking to fill a position. He was interested, and wanted me to bring her in. I called up to Staples and talked to her. I told her who I was and who I was with and asked if she was interested in interviewing. She came in the next day and was hired on the spot. Our manager said she knocked it out of the park. Since then she has been a valuable resource to our team. She is also willing to learn and take on new challenges. Moral of the story<colon> Do not be afraid to continue your education and learn new things. Never back down for a challenge. And please for the love of GOD and all that is Holy, the most important thing; <dq>IF YOU DO NOT KNOW DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK!<dq> I would rather someone ask me about something first and have the right answer, so they don<sq>t screw something up. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I was in your position a few years ago. College degree liberal arts, No IT experience, sick of shitty customer service jobs. Been working IT for about 4 years now. Here<sq>s my advice from the Front.<br><br><br>1) Get A+ Certified (3 parts - beginner, intermediate, advanced. each test is about 100 bucks. you can do it online.)<br>2) Get an MS basic OS cert (Vista,7,or 8. these are easy and interesting if you<sq>ve been using Win for a few years. around 100 bucks each. every test has a book. buy or rent the book. MS makes you go to a building in your area and take the test the old fashioned way). <br>3) Get an MS server cert (100-200 bucks. these are tough tests. prolly have to re-take a few times to pass. this is where you learn what IT guys really do tho).<br><br><br>That<sq>s enough to get hired doing Level 1 Help Desk shit. While it<sq>s still Customer Service it<sq>s a step up because you<sq>re helping people with urgent computer problems so they treat you w/ respect and you<sq>re working with cooler, smarter co-workers. IT people are much more chill and laid back than Sales/Customer Service/HR peeps.  Within a few years you can do Level 2 and 3 Help Desk, then if you keep getting certs (CCNA is the best although classes are between $1-2k) and workplace experience you could be a SysAdmin or Director of IT in a decade or so. Those are 100k a year jobs, sometimes more. Snowden, for instance, made 200k annual working for the NSA and he didn<sq>t even have a high school diploma.<br><br><br>Key is to keep studying after you get your first job. Get old computers and tear them down, figure out what everything does. It<sq>s like Legos. The best thing for me about working in IT is you get to have a job that you can actually enjoy and learn from. Learning about computers & networks, how to setup and troubelshoot them, is fun. Selling shit, being an Accounting cube monkey on Excel spreadsheets, or doing manual labor are not fun. People who have to do something that sucks 40 hours a week end up hating their lives. <br><br><br>IT is every intelligent person<sq>s fallback career because anyone can do it if they have the time and brains to study. In <sq>Outliers<sq> Malcom Gladwell said it takes about 10,000 hours to master something. I<sq>d say it takes about 1000 hours to just play ball. So get cracking. Minimum 2 hours studying every day, some days try to bang out 4-6 hours. Practice good study techniques, don<sq>t just read for 2 hours. Google is your best friend. Google everything that comes your way doing Help Desk; Google when you<sq>re home studying, anytime you have the smallest question. Everything you need to know is online somewhere. The best IT guys don<sq>t know everything off the top their heads, they just know how to find it. <br><br><br><dq>Snake it till you Make it<dq> is the key to surviving in this savage Economy that the American Millennial Generation has been cursed with. 75<percent> of the workforce is just doing busy work they don<sq>t really understand or like to get a paycheck. IT is a good alternative. </p>",

The best answer, is... it depends. There<sq>s a lot of in depth explanation that goes here, but basically, there<sq>s some software out there that can assist with this. Aside from keeping up to date with your patches on your server (including Magento), you should likely also consider implementing a WAF or Web Application Firewall that will block and prevent a number of rudimentary attacks.<br><br>> Is this a common issue among small businesses?<br><br>Unfortunately yes, more so than it should be, and much more than people think.<br><br>> How does the code work?<br><br>This is a web shell. Essentially, when the <dq>hacker<dq> visits this page, they are likely going to be presented with a login screen. The login screen is going to ask for the unsalted value of the md5 hash <sq>2f933d4f6830ac73c08cd7934d10db0f<sq> which has a plaintext value of <sq>pantatmu<sq>.<br><br>Upon submitting the password, they will be presented an interface which allows them to interact with files running on the server using the permissions that they were able to get upon exploiting the server, which, if configured properly, should not be <sq>SYSTEM<sq> or <sq>root<sq> level privileges.<br><br>That being said, the attacker essentially the same amount of access to the server as the web server application does. Meaning that they will be able to launch attacks against clients visiting the site, and modify content on the web server. Depending on the security configuration of your server, it may be worse if they are able to use a local privilege escalation exploit and get <sq>root<sq> or <sq>SYSTEM<sq> level privileges.<br><br>> Are we screwed? Is anyone going to have their CC info stolen? Will we ever know?<br><br>Again, the best answer is, <sq>it depends<sq>. If you<sq>re storing the CC info on the server (in the database), verify whether that information is encrypted, or stored in plaintext. Also understand that by having a shell on the server, an attacker could modify the code that collects CC info from your clients, allowing them to collect it there as well.<br><br>Depending on the sophistication of your attacker, they may leave clues to their presence such as not changing the last modified dates of files they have edited. <br><br>These answers are an oversimplification, but if you<sq>d like more detail, please let me know.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Former Geek here.  (well, still a <sq>geek<sq>, just not that kind).  I would like to clarify a few things for you, as well as others.  <br><br>When it comes to hardware repairs, most things do have to be sent to the repair center, and yes, it is virtually impossible to call the service center directly, even for employees.  It does typically take around 2 weeks, and in some cases even more, when items are sent to that service center.  Now keep in mind, you are still already losing multiple days in just travel time with ups.  At best, the item ships out the next day, and even with 2-day shipping there and back, you already lose 4-6 days, not including weekends depending on when you brought your item in.  <br><br>A lot of people seem to be under the impression that all of these issues can and should be fixed in store.  While in many cases (such as my store) the in-store folks are probably *capable* of doing the work, they are not authorized.  I know what you<sq>re thinking at this point, how stupid that is and that GS is dumb, blah blah blah.  Please understand, this has little to do with Geek Squad.  They are *required* by the manufacturers to send the unit out for repair.  Why, you ask?  Quite simple, actually.  The in-store workers do not have the manufacturer specific tools, equipment, and management to ensure that repairs are being carried out to the spec of the manufacturers.  That is to say, when you send your unit out to the GS service center, you are literally getting identical repair service as you would if you sent it to HP, Dell, Toshiba, Asus, etc. etc... because they are required to follow the strict guidelines for repair by each manufacturer for its products.  The agreement with the individual manufacturers demands that computers be sent to the service center for any hardware repair that is beyond the basic scope of repair at the store level (i.e. things like hard drive and ram).<br><br>To be perfectly honest though, the caliber of employees you will find at GS does vary greatly from store to store.  I happened to have been lucky and worked at one of the absolute best stores in the nation.  But the stupidity of the crap we would have sent to our store by other stores in the area was utterly impressive.  Simple shit that they should have been able to fix, but couldn<sq>t, so they sent the customer to us.  Bottom line here is, not all GSs are created equal.  If you are lucky enough to have multiple stores in your area... try another one.  You might be surprised in the world of difference in service from one store to another.  Just a little tip.<br><br>I also don<sq>t understand why are you upset about your calls after just 5 days.  They told you it would be a few weeks minimum... why would you call to ask for an update before at least the minimum time they quoted you had elapsed?  I get it, you want the thing back asap... but calling for an update doesn<sq>t make it get back any faster.  This is a purely external observation.<br><br>Bottom line though, I am curious what you mean by your windows key is missing.  If you wouldn<sq>t mind giving more detail about this, that would be great.  I<sq>m assuming you bought a computer running windows 8.

A rule of thumb, 5ghz has the best speed, but worst penetration (walls etc) and 2.4ghz has less speed, better penetration, but can be more subject to interference as other devices operate on the same frequency (microwaves, cordless telephones). So use 5Ghz when within a room or two from the router, and 2.4 when outside or across a large house. <br>[](/yayflutter)</p>",

For whatever its worth, personally, I consider <dq>cloud<dq> to be a different medium, even though in reality its going to be on hard drives just like your own copy locally likely is.<br><br>So doing 3-2-1 might get a little rich for your needs.  However, you need to at the very least plan for 2-2-1.<br><br>How can you achieve this?<br><br>Well you need something that can store significant amounts of data locally.  You also need something that can store significant amounts offsite.<br><br>If i were in your shoes... for your local/main copy i<sq>d look to purchase some kind of desktop-style NAS that has removable harddrives (so you can upgrade them in the future).  With the size of drives you are going to need, you want to be looking at RAID6.  That means you are going to lose 2 drives worth of space.  At a bare minimum it needs to be 4 bays, but you lose 50<percent> of your space with only 4 bays.  This is important however because harddrives do die and if you lose your local RAID you really really don<sq>t want to have to download your entire offsite backup.   Your offsite backup is reserved for 2 purposes.  <br><br>1. Total local catastroph, ie your house burns down.  Or yes, your entire RAID6 fails for some other reason.<br>2. Accidental data modifications/deletions that you need to revert.<br><br>Ok so that is your local copy.<br><br>Now you need your 2nd copy, which is also your offsite copy.<br><br>There is something else that is important here.  Versioning / snapshotting.  If you simply sync your local copy and overwrite your backups, guess what happens when you accidentally delete something locally or modify a file beyond repair and want to revert?  Thats right, your backup copy sync<sq>d up and overwrote the orignal copy that you want.  So you need something that will not only keep a copy offiste, but also keeps track of different versions of the same file.<br><br>You have 2 choices here that I can see<colon><br><br>1. You buy a cloud backup solution, CrashPlan, Amazon Cloud Drive would both be decent options... i think backblaze has something like others have said.  I know you quoted their EULA regarding photography business, however I think you are misundertanding it.  They are saying they will not be a file host for your website/client/etc.  It is a backup service and that is it, only accessible by you.<br>2. You buy a 2nd NAS that is compatible with your first, place it at another location (geographically diverse is preferred).  Alot of NASs have support for offsite replication to another unit.  You just need to make sure that the device you choose has versioning / snapshotting support, which again, many of them do.<br><br>If i were you, option (1) is the way I would go.  Alot of these services offer unlimited storage for a very attractive price point and its less hardware for you to have to worry about maintaining.<br><br></p>",

To use Teamviewer the same way we use Logmein the yearly license is about $10 000+. Our national ops manager spoke to Teamviewer and through a misunderstanding we bought a $1000 license. Turns out this license allows only one computer to access 10 host computers at the same time. Not ideal since our callcentre have about six to twelve people on duty at a time.<br><br>Teamviewer is not the end all in a comercial environment.</p>",

The i7 is x86-64 type while qualcomm is ARM. <br><br>Processing isn<sq>t completely related on cores/clock speed. Each architecture has specific functionalities that are optimized to do specific task better. <br><br>ARM processors are part of the RISC family, Reduced Instruction Set Computing. Vs Intel which is part of the CISC family, Complex Instruction Set Computing. <br><br>ARM processors have basic functions to do tasks so to do something might take 10 or so clock pulses to complete while the Intel one might have an optimization that allows it complete it in one. <br><br>A good example of this would be to assume that you have one processor that can add, subtract and multiply. And one which can just add and subtract. So you have 20 x 54. The one that can multiply can take the two numbers and multiply them in 1 cycle. While the one which can just add and subtract will do 54 +54 +54...+54 --20 times to get the final answer. Even though they have the same clock speed the one that can<sq>t multiply needs to do one task 20 times to get an answer while the other needs 1. So it is in essence 20 times quicker. <br><br>ARM processors are used on phones because they inherently run cooler, consume less energy than the Intel ones. That is also why it<sq>s big every time Intel announces that their new processor now runs cooler and consumes less energy than the previous generation. <br><br>ARM processors are behind Intel processors by a few years.

The Macbook Pro does not have this problem.<br><br>* The Macbook Pro has Intel Iris Pro graphics, and the NVIDIA GT 750M can also be included (with 2GB of dedicated VRAM). The HTC One has the less powerful Adreno 330 GPU and shared video memory with the main system RAM.<br><br>* The HTC One has only 2GB of RAM, which means that programs will also perform slower if they use heavy amounts or RAM. The Macbook Pro also has 4-16GB of RAM.<br><br>* Because ARM is low-power, it also means that the processor will perform slower as it cannot use too much power at once.<br><br>* The Snapdragon MSM8974AB is a 32-bit only processor, so applications cannot take advantage of 64-bit extensions as seen in the Intel Processor used on the Macbook Pro.<br><br>* The HTC One runs Android which is more limited in Application APIs (such as being able to use only one program at a time), while the Macbook Pro running OS X can use preemptive multitasking.<br><br>You also have to consider the pipeline lengths of each processor.

I couldn<sq>t find one as there is the same in vs out debate all over the internet.  From what I<sq>ve gathered....  <br><br>Hot air rises, therefor you want exhaust fans at the top and intake fans at the bottom.  If your case layout only allows for a fan in either the top or the bottom then you decision is made for you.<br><br>If you still have a choice then it<sq>s a toss up between dust vs hot air.  Having 1 exhaust will suck air and dust in from every possible spot, but will quickly remove the hottest air because its at the top right beside the fan.  If you have 1 intake then you<sq>ll have positive pressure which will decrease the amount of dust, but the hot air will linger for longer.<br><br>So what do you want?  A PC you don<sq>t have to clean, or one that<sq>s a bit cooler?</p>",

(nor would you want them to be) So, remember, if you blow air out you get plenty of cooler air sucked in (like in real estate though, location matters) and vice versa, if you blow cooler air in, the hot air gets pushed out. Again, location matters. Good cases are set up with venting to direct this flow. Bad cases it just gets sucked in or out where ever, usually through edges of drive bays, back panel, etc.<br></p>",

Usually the pilot hole is drilled right in the center of where you put the hole in the drywall. If you have carpet you can pry up a little bit of it to make the pilot hole, for me I just stuck a flash light on it(something I did when I installed cable, alot of the cable I installed went through floors or on the outside of the house) to see where it was at.<br><br>The 2nd floor can be a little odd to get Ethernet up there. For my house the 2nd floor has an attic on the side of my bedroom. There<sq>s a chimney that is ONLY used for my water heater. If need be I can run a cable up through there. For a traditional 2 story house it depends how the 2nd floor was built, if your luckly, you can get a fishtape or glowrod and run it up to the 2nd floor with it not hitting anything. Sometimes theres a stud where the floors are at(this is the case most of the time).

You can get a set of 3 from harbor freight that are 18 inches long in 3 sizes. You can use the largest to punch the hole then tape the cable to the smallest(or an unbent wire coat hanger if you dont want to spend the money on the fishtape or glowrods and push it up to the hole in the drywall. The first floor depending on where you want the outlets and if your basement ISNT finished shouldnt be that hard. The 2nd floor can be a pain. It might require an electrician with special tools(i think they make reaaaaaaly long drill bits) to get it to the 2nd floor if you absolutely need it fished through the walls.</p>",

If you buy cheap stuff now, you<sq>ll end up scrapping half of it and starting over, which feels awful. Buy decent stuff! Depends where you live, but I managed to get 50<percent>+ savings on pretty much everything by buying it on a trade account (via electrician bro).<br><br><br>* Cat5e is usually the preferred cable. Anything less wont do Gig-E, and anything more is too expensive. Honestly, even Cat6 is wasted unless you have server-grade switches, network cards and Cat6 jacks and patch panels, or are running cables a long way. Cat5e carries Gig-E just fine, and making everything Cat5e grade could save you lots of cash. <br><br><br>* Get a box of cable (1000ft?) and either keep the leftover, or flick it on ebay (measure off what you take, so you know how much is left when you sell). Cable designed for in-wall use isn<sq>t very suitable for making regular network cables. Do some reading about shielded vs unshielded, and solid wire vs braided wire. Remember to always leave a couple of feet of slack at each end of every single cable so you can cut into them if necessary, and stay away from power cabling. Cable is probably the most important piece of the install and the hardest and most expensive to change later. Also, get a cable tester, and test every single jack - before and after fitting it in the wall.<br><br><br>* Look into getting a flush mount wall box to use as the central point for all your networking. This should be big enough to fit your patch panels, 8 or 16 port network switch, router/modem, power plugs, and potentially, phone and tv switching gear.  You<sq>ll need patch cables, which you can either make with your offcuts of cat5e, or buy pre-made. Personally, I gladly buy them. This can be installed in a wardrobe or cupboard, behind a door, in the garage, or as the centrepiece of your geek room. Just decide where you<sq>d like it, take some measurements (dont forget about wall studs) and go shopping for something fitting.<br><br><br>* Get good jacks which are fully compatible with a real krone tool, and get one of those as well. I wasted over a day fucking around re-punching and testing ports, because we opted for cheaper jacks which didn<sq>t bite cable correctly. The number of ports in each room will vary. In most cases you<sq>re better off keeping the jack count low, and spending the money on a good wireless AP or two. I<sq>d go with 4 behind the tv/stereo, and a slim 2-port jack plate in other locations. In large/busy rooms, multiple jacks spaced around the room is better than all in one spot. Again, you<sq>ll need cables. You can either make your own, or buy them. either way, i<sq>d suggest keeping a bunch of spares in individual ziplock bags somewhere. Hopefully you<sq>ll never need to touch a crimper again. If you like, you can fit different jack types to each plate, so you could also run things like TV, phone (though this can be patched through cat5e), Audio signals, Speaker cabling, etc. You can do HDMI, but this requires 2x Cat6 runs, I think. Plan it all now, even if you cant afford it  all now. <br><br><br>* When it comes to lan parties, you<sq>re potentially better off connecting a single switch to the wall socket, and have the guests plug into that. Think about what people do during the lan, and plan for that. ie, if they<sq>re sharing files between themselves or gaming locally, you dont want or need that running through the house. If some are gaming online, and others are grabbing stuff off your file server in the den, they would get better performance having a cable each. <br><br><br><br>So the list so far is<colon><br><br>* cable<br><br>* jacks & plates<br><br>* krone tool<br><br>* wall box<br><br>* patch panel(s?)<br><br>* patch leads<br><br>* network leads<br><br>* cable tester<br><br><br>As well as the stuff you<sq>ll need to get the wires through the walls in the first place (i dont know..) you<sq>ll want hand cream, bath soak, and alcohol for when its finally done <colon>)</p>",

If the password is in windows 10, you don<sq>t need it to wipe and reinstall (unless he asked you to backup his data first). If it<sq>s the bios that<sq>s passworded, probably he doesn<sq>t know it (if he didn<sq>t do it himself), and most likely is a factory default password, look for it on google with the laptop model.

Modern linux distros should be able to differentiate which logical cores are assigned to physical cores. As a result, the thread scheduler will load balance in such a way that it picks two logical cores that belong to different physical cores when possible. This occurs because two logical cores != the performance of two physical cores. If you are utilising all 4 logical processors, your guest will get one physical core, and your host will get one physical core.<br><br>As for the benefits of hyper threading, testing indicates that multithreaded workloads perform 30<percent> faster as a result of hyperthreading. Obviously, this isn<sq>t quite the same performance gain as more physical cores, but hyperthreading only increases power consumption and die-size by 5<percent>, so it can be quite economical. <br><br>Obviously, there are drawbacks to Hyper-threading. Each physical core has its own cache, and each logical processor shares this cache with another. Applications that are cache-friendly will compete with each other for the cache if they are both running on the same core, which can lead to performance degradation. Also, if a program isn<sq>t written for multiple threads, it won<sq>t perform better when you throw even more threads at it. <br><br>I hope this helps, and if anyone else has any corrections let me know.

Some nice sounding girl named Ashley (who is clearly not a nice girl at all, and actually a huge asshole that likes to scam old ladies). They told her the fee was $399 and they asked for her bank account number. And they even sent her an email with the bill (from a yahoo account. Like, seriously? At least TRY to look like a legit company). I<sq>m actually on this subreddit to figure out what I need to do!<br><br>My grandmother called me almost as soon as this happened. I was at work and didn<sq>t know what happened, so I just had her unplug her computer. After work my husband and I went over there, and she showed us what had happened.  My husband ran malwarebytes on her computer, which removed some programs. One of the programs was an internet explorer toolbar (I<sq>m guessing it was really a program to monitor her internet activity?). We changed her email password, and she called the bank and had them change her account number. I asked her to tell me all of the credit cards and other accounts she pays online. The list was pretty long, and she was pretty flustered, so we decided to just change the passwords that she has saved on her browser (which was only the email, thankfully). But now I<sq>m worried we should have changed all the other passwords as well, and maybe just wiped the computer (and also how do I do that?).<br><br>It also looks like the scammer installed Chrome on her computer, which is odd. I<sq>m not really sure what that<sq>s about, but after reading [this](https<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3iddnk/i_have_been_linked_to_a_stranger_on_my_phone_and/?ref=search_posts) post, I<sq>m wondering if maybe they had it signed into their account so they can attempt to get at any of her online account info? Either way, we uninstalled it and reinstalled it. We also added Ad Block, and told her to use Chrome instead of I.E. from now on. I<sq>m hoping that Ad Block will help prevent future scammers from baiting her, since it will be more difficult for pop-ups to appear. <br><br>I<sq>m still worried about this though. I don<sq>t know if it<sq>s possible for the scammer to access her online accounts if she doesn<sq>t have any passwords saved, but I think tomorrow I<sq>m going to have her write out a list of all the online bill pay accounts, and we can go ahead and change the passwords together. She was way too flustered to do it today anyway. Is there anything else I should do? </p>",

Laptop unplugged, laptop plugged into wall power in the room, laptop plugged into wall power in a different room, cell phone(s), incandescent flashlights, LED flashlights, webcam on a tether to a device in the next room, etc.  Check a hand-held GPS if you can find one.  I want to know if it<sq>s unique to **devices with antennas.**  <br>2. Verify that it<sq>s not internal to the house by killing power to the breaker in that room and then repeating another test of a known-to-fail device and a known-to-work device.  Verify that known-bad devices still fail and known-good devices still work when the breaker<sq>s off.  This step is to reassure us that it<sq>s not something in the **building<sq>s power supply.**    <br>3. Try terminating any coaxial connections in the room -- an un-shielded Comcast cable could be catching RF from somewhere else and radiating full-blast into the master bedroom.  Most MBRs have a cable jack, right?  Terminate the cable with shielded coax and a 50ohm plug.  I<sq>d like to be sure it<sq>s not **RF blasting out a co-ax jack**. Also document any outlets other than electrical (co-ax, phone, etc.).      <br>4. Document for us every electronic device in the master bedroom or in any adjacent room, especially rooms adjacent vertically (above or below).  Any new electronics in the last 7 days are particularly suspect, obviously.  This is really just to eliminate **leaky <sq>trons**.          <br>5. Check to see if there are any cell towers within 1km or so, any businesses with large rooftop antennas within 1km or so.  Any neighbors who drive plug-in hybrids might also be something (overnight charging perhaps?).  If you get to this step I<sq>m grasping at straws and looking for any other possible source for **high-power ambient RF**.  <br><br>My guess is that something like a home security system is operating in a nearby home.

                "answer": "<p>Large quantities of RF and microwave radiation can do this, particularly microwave. And it<sq>s not something that you should live in or spend much time in, if this is the case. If this is the case, the techs and client needs to de-ass the area and bring pros in, maybe even the FCC.<br><br>In addition to terminating coax in or near the house, start here<colon><br><br>1. Look around the neighborhood where they live. Is there a cellular tower nearby? A microwave relay link? Look for towers with those big dish antennae that look like kettle drums, or wire baskets, or flat round or square panels, or even giant horns/funnels.<br><br>2. Does this person have any enemies or weird neighbors? Google<colon> HERF gun. Someone could be deliberately pointing the magnetron taken from a microwave oven at his house. If so, this is not good and is dangerous and (should be) illegal. High power microwave can be focused and thrown long distances with waveguides and an antennae. This is why they<sq>ve used it for decades for line-of-sight relay towers because it was cheaper and higher bandwidth than laying copper cable across mountain ranges. As far as I know, it<sq>s still in use today.<br><br>3. Regarding the 50 amp reading on the tech<sq>s amp meter<colon> being bathed in the flux of heavy RF or microwave energy could be causing induction in the internal electronics or the amp-meter coil loop, giving this reading, which wouldn<sq>t be a true measurement of actual amps in the air, but the device itself being overloaded and causing malfunction. You could possibly test this by taking a medium or smallish extension cord, coiling it into a circular loop about a foot across, plugging it in to itself to form a complete circuit and then putting the amp meter jaws around the edge of this loop and moving it around the room to see if the reading changes. It might give different values for different orientations. Hold the coil vertically and rotate through 360 degrees, holding still and taking measurements every 15 degrees or so. If you get a consistent set of readings while aligned one direction, and a different consistent set of readings while aligned 90 degrees from that direction, it<sq>s almost certainly an RF issue. Try the loop unplugged from itself, too.<br><br>4. If it<sq>s not microwave, it could be someone operating a dirty or poorly grounded antennae at very high wattages. There are people who will run very large linear amplifiers on dirty sources like a CB radio, illegally operated Ham/Amateur radio, pirate broadcast radio, spark gap device transmitters, Tesla coils or other sources of extreme RF energy.<br><br>5. Call an RF technician. One that actually has an RF spectrum analyzer, triangulation antennae, directional microwave dish antennae, etc. A good local HAM operator may also have a lot of these tools or be able to sniff out a source of strong RF radiation.<br><br>All that being said, I would immediately advise the customer to not dwell or live in that bedroom until this is resolved. It sounds a lot like a major RF energy issue, and you really don<sq>t want to steep in that much energy for very long. Microwave/RF is not ionizing radiation like a pile of radioactive waste emitting actual gamma/alpha particles, but it<sq>s not super healthy to live in, either.</p>",

The 5GHz routers alleviate some/most of the issues, but not always. According to the [manufacturer<sq>s website](http<colon>//support.linksys.com/en-us/support/routers/E2000) your router supports the 5GHz band.

This is because with the 2.4GHz band the frequencies are longer and further apart, whereas with the 5GHz band the frequencies are shorter and closer together. The most likely solution here would be to use the 5GHz band on your router which allow higher theoretical bandwidth and maybe better connection stability. If the 5GHz band does not solve your issue or the range becomes a problem then you may want to look into a powerline ethernet solution.<br><br>For more details you could also try x-posting on /r/HomeNetworking/ as the people that frequent that sub are more knowledgeable about this topic.

By doing that, itunes will recognize it as a device in recovery mode and allow you to do a complete wipe and reinstall of the iOS.  You will have to wipe the device and update it to the current firmware to bypass the previous owners password.  To place it in DFU mode, turn it off, plug it into the computer, hold down the power button as soon as it is plugged in, when the apple logo comes up then press the home button (while still holding the power button,) once the apple logo goes away release the power button and then keep holding the home button until you see that itunes recognizes a device in recovery mode, then select restore.  You have to be connected to the internet and if the serial number is blogged by Appl then this will not work. If it<sq>s too hard to get it in DFU mode (better instructions are online,) you can place it into recovery mode by turning it off, hold the home button while you plug it into the computer and keep holding the home button until the connect to itunes animation appears on the iPod.  If you choose that method, the first retore may fail and you will have to do it 2 or 3 times but both methods will work to bypass the previous owner<sq>s password.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Did some quick research, the best answer I could find is that it doesn<sq>t matter much, but there is a difference. <br><br>Back in the early days of DVD, the DVD Forum was created as a group to manage the original DVD specfications. This of course didn<sq>t happen in a vacuum -- there were people already working on DVD at the time, in particular, Panasonic, Pioneer, Sony, and Philips. In fact, DVD was a unification of two competing technologies, one championed by Panasonic and Pioneer, the other by Sony and Philips... and it was most like the former<sq>s disc. <br><br>They announced the DVD, shortly followed up by DVD-R for Authoring, to allow developers to make a full DVD (with encryption and all), later by DVD-R General, which is the one everyone uses today. Pioneer had long had a disc called a PD disc, which is like a re-writeable CD, only not CD compatible, but much better for computer use. So the DVD Forum announced DVD-RAM, essentially just a PD with DVD geometries, and that was that. <br><br>Only problem<colon> you can<sq>t play a DVD-RAM in a plain old DVD player... it doesn<sq>t look anything like a DVD-ROM. To address this, Sony and Philips (worrying about how to make a DVD player that could replace a VHS videotape deck) came up with DVD+RW. The DVD Forum guys didn<sq>t like that, but they saw the problem with DVD-RAM, so they then came up with the DVD-RW disc. The <dq>+<dq> guys now countered with DVD+R. <br><br>For the most part, DVD+R and DVD-R are identical... when you burn them, they appear to any spec-correct player as a DVD-ROM. The only real difference is that DVD+R can list itself by ID code as a DVD-ROM, whereas the DVD-R always says its a DVD-R. No big deal today, but back in the dark ages some DVD players rejected any disc that didn<sq>t claim to be a DVD-ROM. <br><br>For DVD-RW or DVD+RW, there<sq>s a thing called a <dq>wobbly track<dq> which is kind of trick to provide timing information to the writer about just where the disc is positioned. The DVD+RW has much tighter timing than the DVD-RW, so it<sq>s possible to do sector-accurate rewriting on a DVD+RW, not so on a DVD-RW. That was considered necessary for a DVD recorder that worked just like a VHS deck. However, Panasonic solved this problem for DVD-R/RW... they simply put a hard drive in their DVD recorder... you could edit on the HDD, then write out to disc. See the link below for more technical discussion, but for most use, it just doesn<sq>t matter. <br><br>More detailed explanation<colon> [http<colon>//www.myce.com/article/why-dvdrw-is-superior-to-dvd-rw-203/](http<colon>//www.myce.com/article/why-dvdrw-is-superior-to-dvd-rw-203/)<br></p>",

If you are on DSL I can offer you some advice. <br><br>First of all you need to do what ever you can to lower the attenuation on your line. A DSL signal will naturally attentuate (desgrate/weaken) with the line length. The copper that runs up to your premises will be a lot greater than that of any extension wiring you have in the house, so recommend that you hook up as close to the termination point as you can. <br><br>Any additional extensions in the house create what are called Bridge taps, so the signal will bounce off the extension socket before hitting your modem or going back to the DSLAM causing parasite noise. This will also lower your line speed. <br><br>If all these are good, there are other things we can do. Provided that your SNR (signal to noise ratio, this protects you from electrical noise) is stable on the line, you can ask your ISP to lower the target SNR on the line as this takes up bandwidth so your line speed will increase, for every 3dB, you will probably see about a 500kbit increase. <br><br>If your ISP is not willing to do this, there are several firmware hacks that you can grab for routers, the DGTeam were pretty good, they released quite a Netgear firmwares, from DG834, both the AR7 AND BCM6348 chipsets. Though I would recommend going for the 834v4 or later, as the 834v3 and lower used the AR7 chipset which had some stability issues. <br><br>If you need any further tips let me know, as there will be other things that we could look at. <br></p>",

The more desktop space you have on your desk, the more files you can have out, view and edit at the same time. (This is related to how many programs you can have open and running at once)<br><br>- The person sitting at the desk moving the files around between the drawer and the desktop and also changing these files is the CPU or Processor.<br><br>The HDD is typically the bottleneck for speed on most modern computers. A Solid State Drive (SSD) is fast and very similar to the way that memory, or RAM works (at least in laymen terms). Upgrading or changing your HDD will not effect the amount of memory or RAM you have.<br><br>An advanced side note is that Windows Operating Systems utilize something called PageFile. PageFile is a dedicated amount of space your computer uses on your HDD but treats it like memory. It<sq>s not as fast, but if you have too many things open, this will keep things from not working entirely. (perhaps think of pagefile like a desktop filing bin that sits in your drawer? I need a better analogy for this) The point of this is that, with the upgraded SSD, since SSDs are MUCH faster than traditional HDDs are, your pagefile will be much faster.<br><br>That being said, don<sq>t worry too much about this detail. The most cost effective thing you could do to improve the speed and performance of your computer is to install more memory! I<sq>m assuming you have Vista from the age of the laptop.

Some leave a few registry entries and loose files around. Often they need multiple scans and reboots. Others are very thorough, and offer a <sq>repair<sq> option which is quite nice in the case of viruses that target your executable files. Repair is much better than having to delete and reinstall program files. One of the reasons I like avira is it seems to kill the virus in one pass and sometimes lets me repair the affected files. <br><br>tldr; Avira. Gdata if you want to spend money. As a secondary program, MBAM is excellent and can run side-by-side with avira.</p>",

As my team deal with webservers on a daily basis.<br><br>Any system that runs off a back office such Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal (the list could go on) developed and provided by either a well used 3rd party or open sourced should always be kept up-to-date. <br><br>I will use Joomla here as an example (it applies to most platforms).<br>A website running an out of date version or Joomla platform with multiple plugins and a 3rd party theme is very vulnerable and a prime target for spammers to spread their wares. They will use exploits in Joomla (Google Joomla exploits, there are loads), exploits in plugins used for functionality (Google Virtuemart Joomla exploits, there are also loads) and exploits in themes which use 3rd party tools such as Tim Thumb. They will use attacks such as SQL Injections, LFIs, RFIs to take root control or upload a shell to the webserver then use the server to spam or spread malware through websites.<br><br>This is important to have if you use Wordpress/Joomla etc, it is a grey area however who is responsible for its upkeep. The website once completed and live, it marks the end of your contract with the developer and once the site is handed over then it is your responsibility to keep it safe (regardless if you have the know how to do it). It IS however in the interest of the person hosting the site to keep it secure because if the server is hacked (presuming you pay for them for the hosting) they have to fix the problem or pay someone (like us) to find and fix the problem for them, the server should be secure but hackers have their ways of bypassing scanners etc.<br><br>My advice is to go back and bargain on a monthly maintenance package that is reasonable for you and rather than them tell you the cost you explain your budget, if the developer is small they may prefer a fee spread monthly. With this option also you are binding them into contract with you on a monthly basis and they may provide a bit more support too and not just one off updates.<br><br>Hope this helped.

Anytime you<sq>re Googling solutions, you can learn new skills. See something that<sq>s probably not the answer but looks interesting? Click on it and see what it says. While Google provides a wealth of knowledge, there<sq>s virtually no wrong way to learn IT knowledge (unless you<sq>re somehow setting things on fire, then you really need to analyze the situation). Learn the process of how your computer connects to a gaming server, or even start your own gaming server to learn some online basics. Throw a Linux distribution on an old PC or in VirtualBox or learn how to dual boot (and try to utilize the terminal a bit). Copy some files on Windows with the Command Line. Build a website and buy a ($10) domain name along with a cheap VPS ($5-$30). **Just try things and learn as you go!**<br><br>- Ever worked on computers for other people and earned money (even just $5)? That<sq>s a period of self-employment, and might be the best way to boast your skills on an application. Use your customers as professional references; you provided a service for them and they paid you for your skill.<br><br>- Try to get some experience with basic office skills. Filing, answering phones, etc. This is one area where my internship is really helpful, even if I don<sq>t promote within this organization. Extra points if you can say you <dq>created<dq>, <dq>organized<dq>, or <dq>maintained<dq> any form of records.<br><br>- Be sure you have people skills. A lot of people I know online who are great at different IT tasks but don<sq>t have a job simply hate people. Now, you can still hate people and be nice to them, but many people have trouble with this. So fake your smiles at first if you have to - you<sq>ll end up tricking yourself into genuine happiness. Appearances aren<sq>t the only important part though, you need to be able to communicate. In the IT field, that means pulling out information that the client doesn<sq>t share at first. Be nice, but ask as many questions as you need to. **You have to understand the problem before you can find a solution.**<br><br>- Try to train your brain. I have a knack for remembering computer-related things, but many people aren<sq>t that lucky. Knowledge is power, but memory is impressive.<br><br>- Have fun! Ensure that you<sq>re enjoying yourself in this field, or else you might want to look elsewhere. You won<sq>t just know overnight that you love your job and start seeing everything in beautiful colors. I look at it more as something that keeps me busy where the days go by fast, and I feel that I actually can help people.<br><br>Hopefully this helped!</p>",

I and many others deem them to be worth the premium as I spend several hours a day on my computer and I want the experience to be pleasant.<br><br>2. Lack of customizability.  This doesn<sq>t really apply to the non-retina MacBook Pros which are just about as customizable as most PCs are.  The MacBook Airs and the new retina MacBook Pros are, however, quite uncustomizable.  The rMBP can be upgraded to 16GB of RAM which will more than likely be just fine for most everything you would do with it for the foreseeable future of the laptop.  The MacBook Airs can only be upgraded to 8GB which may very well be quite skimpy a few years from now, although the MacBook Airs are not meant for applications that would require a ton of RAM.  I would be particularly worried about the soldered-on SSDs, however you can (at high cost) upgrade the rMBP to 768GB which is equivalent to the largest commercially available SSDs today.  If you<sq>re worried about space, I would advise against going the SSD route altogether until they get larger and cheaper.</p>",

I looked it up and apparently it wasn\u2019t an uncommon problem amongst ASUS laptops, and the busted hinge was starting to crack the case a little so I sent it in before any more damage could be caused. As per their instructions on the phone and on the form I detailed exactly what I wanted done and I sent the laptop without the battery.<br><br><br>The following is the timeline of events that follows<colon><br><br>**9/19**<colon> Sent my laptop through UPS to ASUS with the assurance that it usually only takes about 7-10 days to get the laptop back, maybe a little more if parts need to be ordered.<br><br>**9/26**<colon> ASUS receives my laptop as confirmed by them and UPS tracking.<br><br>**10/6**<colon> I contact ASUS customer support and they have no clue why I haven<sq>t been contacted after so long. They say they<sq>ll see if someone will get back to me and they open a case number.<br><br>**10/7**<colon> I contact ASUS again and still the rep doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening so they open an \u201cescalated case\u201d and transfer me to a supervisor. The supervisor (from here on I have the names of all the people I contacted but I\u2019ll leave them out of this log) tells me he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong either and that is an unusually long wait time. He also says that he doesn\u2019t know what an \u201cescalated case\u201d is, and that the rep who transferred me just randomly created a new regular case for who knows why. The supervisor puts me on hold while he contacts the repair department to see what\u2019s up. They tell him that they\u2019re waiting on parts. I ask why no one contacted me to tell me any of this, and he says I can check the status of my repair on service.asus.com by putting my RMA number in there. I don\u2019t see anything but he doesn\u2019t seem to believe me. <br><br>I ask him if there\u2019s anything I can do to be compensated for such a long wait without any contact or estimate. He agrees that that\u2019s reasonable and suggests I dispute the invoice when I receive it in my email, then mention that in the dispute note. He says there\u2019s no further updates and I should receive more information within 24-48 hours, and if not to call back.<br><br>**10/13**<colon> I call back since it\u2019s been well beyond that with no update. I briefly explain what\u2019s going on  to the rep and he transfers me to the supervisor, who happens to be the same supervisor as before. He\u2019s nice and understanding. I ask him if there are any updates and he says he doesn\u2019t see any. He also admits that checking service.asus.com wouldn\u2019t be too helpful for me as he found out that the information he sees in regards to the RMA status update on his end is different than what I see on my end. For me I just see one of five general status options (for a long time it\u2019s just been \u201cproduct repair is in progress\u201d, and it still is), while he sees a slightly more detailed status when he pulls up my RMA number. He contacts the repair department again and finally updates me the list of parts they\u2019re waiting on. They\u2019re waiting on the hinges, bezels, etc, and then also the hard drive. I say that in the initial RMA note where I outlined the repairs I needed done, I never mentioned anything about that and I don\u2019t want the hard drive replaced because the one that\u2019s in there now is just a regular back-up hard drive I have. Fully functioning, but since I moved to an SSD I didn\u2019t need it anymore, and also since it\u2019s a fairly old laptop even the hard drive that\u2019s in there right now isn\u2019t the original one but I\u2019d still like it returned intact. He says he\u2019ll tell them to remove that from the list of items to repair and that hopefully I should get the invoice from them soon.<br><br>**10/15-16**<colon> It happens. I finally get emailed the invoice. At this point it\u2019s nearing a month but not there yet so I\u2019m so excited\u2026. then I see the hard drive replacement on the invoice. That\u2019s $140 of something I don\u2019t need and I can\u2019t believe after two days they still decided to put it on there. Within a few hours of receiving the invoice (it arrived late in the day on the 15th) I had responded to the invoice with the dispute, and in the dispute note I noted to please remove the hard drive replacement from the repairs and if any compensation can be done for all my waiting.<br><br>By this point despite all my calls and assurances from all the previous rep and supervisor calls that told me I should receive one, I pretty much hadn\u2019t been contacted by anyone. I called customer support to talk to them about the dispute and make sure I\u2019d get some kind of response by filling it out perfectly. When you get that little glimer of progress you don\u2019t want to lose out on it by doing something wrong. The rep I talked to wasn\u2019t all too friendly and for some reason was pretty adament about not transfering me to a supervisor despite my repeated requests. I guess you could say he helped with my question (i.e. \u201cwill this dispute even work?\u201d) but the conversation clearly wasn\u2019t going too great and I think he knew it. At the end of the phone call he asked if I would like to complete a survey about my experience with him, as all the reps and supervisors are required to ask at the end of the conversation. I say yes and so transfers me. I wait then hear an automated voice say, \u201cEnter Rep ID.\u201d I don\u2019t know what to do, then it says, \u201cNot a valid Rep ID. Goodbye.\u201d That bugged me. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling he did it on purpose so I called back and explained what had just happened to the new rep. He apologized, gave me the name of the previous rep, and said that isn\u2019t how they like to treat customers. It appeared to him that most likely the previous rep didn\u2019t transfer me correctly. He couldn\u2019t transfer me to a survey for that previous rep, since he could only transfer people to his own surveys, but he suggested that I contact ASUS through their escalation mailbox if I would like to make a complaint. I was bothered and I had the time.<br><br>If you aren\u2019t familiar with ASUS support you have two options, calling tech support or sending them a message through their escalation mailbox which gets sent directly to their corporate department. You fill out this form online with all your information and are assured a response from their company directly. I wrote up a 2 point note; first explaining the weird survey incident and second a little summary of my whole situation with the laptop wait and the hard drive problem.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>That really isn<sq>t true.  Cable works on a node.  Most modern cable systems, that are DOCSIS 3 have multiple bandwidth channels per node. Each channel is 38mbps, and you should have 4-8 downstream channels.  That means a node gets about 150-300mbps.<br><br>Keep in mind, the main thing with cable is while a group of people share bandwidth in the area, not everyone us utilizing 100<percent> bandwidth all the time.  This is why a 20mb cable connection is $50 and a 1.5mb t1 line is $600.  You get a faster connection for cheaper with the caveat that the total bandwidth is shared. So while in a technical sense, your cousin is right, bandwidth in an area is shared he<sq>s wrong that it isn<sq>t worth it.  All residential internet service is shared. DSL is to. You aren<sq>t paying for a dedicated connection from anyone, cable, dsl, dial up, cell wifi, satellite etc. The only way you get dedicated is by paying out the ass for it. All the companies watch utilization very closesly, which is the total percentage of bandwidth in use at a given time. When we get close we split the system into 2 nodes, so the utilization goes down. Given that in the current economic climate consumers have been cutting back for years, utilization really hasn<sq>t been an issue in a while.<br><br>Here is the bottom line.  Figure out what you will use the internet for, then buy the connection speed that best matches your usage.  If you are a facebook/email/google a recipe kind of person (generally the 50+ moms and grandmas) buy the cheapest dsl or cable connection you can. Streaming video? buy at least a 5mb connection.  If you have multiple users and expect to have simultaneous gaming or straming video, buy something that is about 5mb per simultaneous connection. So 2 people 10mb, 4 people 20mb.  If your going to download shit all the time (watch out pirates, we see you) buy the fastest connection you can afford.</p>",

General computer knowledge (or general knowledge of any kind) isn<sq>t proprietary. Sales and engineering would be the fields most common to see this. A salesman quitting their job, and then calling up all their old clients to get them to switch to their new company would have a non-compete enforced. An engineer quitting their job and bringing designs or concepts developed by their employer with them could have a non-compete enforced against them. Generally, any one who is taking proprietary information from their former employers and using it to further their career elsewhere. Attempts to use a non-compete clause to prevent someone from simply working in their field are never successful - at least I<sq>ve never heard of it. <br><br>I can<sq>t think of a scenario where an IT person would see this happen. And if by tech-support you mean a call center job, I *really* can<sq>t see a way in which anyone would ever successfully enforce a non-compete. <br><br>Hit up /r/legaladvice. Find lawyer and give them $50 for 10 minutes of their time if you really want. Honestly, I wouldn<sq>t worry about it though. I say that as someone who has flagrantly ignored non-competes on three occasions - one of them in which the employer actually brought it up in a thinly-veiled-threat kind of way when I told them I was leaving... call center of all places as well. I just laughed, and started a real IT job making 3 times as much two weeks later... pretty much everyone I knew at that call center did the same within a year. A lot of HR departments just include that shit as boilerplate in their employment contracts just to cover their asses. I suspect its more common in call centers, and that call center managers actually talk about it like it matters, because call centers biggest problem is employee turnover. Scaring you into not leaving is a way to mitigate that, even if the threats are completely hollow.<br><br>EDIT<colon><br><br>Reading through the rest of the thread, I see the job in question is at a hospital. I<sq>m curious if the clause specifically says <dq>IT<dq> or <dq>Tech Support<dq> or if it just says something like <dq>in the same field.<dq> If the latter, that<sq>s almost certainly aimed mainly at the doctors  at the hospital, as medicine would be kind of a similar circumstance as sales - they don<sq>t want a doctor to quit, start up their own private practice, and invite all their old patients to come with them. </p>",

I can offer you my suggestions for success at a minimum<colon><br><br>Train and train your phone support skills!<br>Most companies start you off in phone support and that will most likely be your first job in IT. Work on being fluid, friendly and efficient. Most of the time phone support or Tier 1 support only has a small window to fix issues so if you want to make an impact be excellant and connecting with your customers (making them feel the issue is <dq>our issue not your issue<dq>) and also being a demi-god at fixing shit remotely. So many times phone support seems scripted and boring - while it is if you can make it a good personal experience that is your ticket to moving forward. Even if your goal is not phone support make it amazing, you will get promoted.<br><br>Connect with your customers! <br>If you work in a company where you might see your customers, make your mark as someone they would want to invite over to chat with personally. If you move up from phone support you will be meeting customers in person, work on making that experience great for them. If you can provide the same level of technical skill as someone else BUT make the social experience superior you just won the game.<br><br>Be a point of contact! <br>Even if you can<sq>t do something a customer asks, escalate the issue and be the point of contact for them. They know you didn<sq>t do the work however because you are the POC for them they associate it with you. You get the kudos and the feedback. Besides, you want to make sure everyone who comes in contact with you is satisfied, right? They will come back to you (also - make yourself available!) and repeat business is always a good thing.<br><br>Learn everything you can from on the job!<br>If there are tiers above you, learn from them. Most higher tiers also started where you are and if you approached them with a humble attitude and a willingness to learn they will be on board to teach you more. You can get certs in anything but like others have said- experience is king. Learn from them and get some experience. Find the escalation partner that does what you want to do and foster a mentor-ship with them.<br><br>Feedback - learn to take it!<br>No one likes to hear they are doing something wrong, but it<sq>s going to happen. Listen to people and learn from it. If you do something really wrong, swallow that pride pill and modify how you handle it. I<sq>ve had to learn the hard way in a few cases and I recommend to not follow this path. However if you do, just make sure you eventually learn - hopefully not before you get the axe.<br><br>Specialize your IT experience!<br>In all reality IT support is very similar however if you can gain flavors of support you can become more attractive while hiring. I<sq>ve work IT support for a major bank, major hospital, and major manufacturing company. I tout myself as someone who understands IT needs for financial corporations, healthcare systems, and medical device manufacturers. While I might have done the same things in each place, the surrounding environments is important to note.<br><br>Most importantly - have fun!<br>Someone once told me this <dq>Based on your posts and converation with you, I see that your job is something you love!

Contact ATT and see if they have a higher-end modem/router that supports QoS.  <br><br>IF ATT doesn<sq>t have one, then you can do the following.<br><br>1.) Purchase a router that supports QoS -  [TP-LINK TL-WR841N Wireless N300 Home Router](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-WR841N-Wireless-Router-300Mpbs/dp/B001FWYGJS) or [NetGear NightHawk](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-AC1900-Gigabit-Router/dp/B00F0DD0I6)  <br>1a.) If you have an older wireless router lying around, you can install DDRT and/or Tomato on it. However, you may also be limited to lower speeds.  <br>2.) Set your [2Wire to Bridge Mode](http<colon>//scottworldblog.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/how-do-you-put-an-att-2wire-3800hgv-b-router-into-bridge-mode-so-that-i-can-use-it-with-my-apple-time-capsule-or-airport-extreme/).  <br>3.) You can copy your settings (manually) from the 2Wire over to the new router, so you do not have to go through the hassle of handing out WPA2 keys and SSIDs to all the machines again. As long as the SSID and the WPA2 key are the same, the machines should automatically join.  <br>4.) Follow the manual for which ever router you got to enabled QoS.  <br>4a.) If you want to setup static IPAs for your all your devices you can.   <br>5.) Buy some decent sound-canceling headphones so you do not have to hear your sister complain and whine about slow internet speeds. ;)<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>- The write endurance of for example an Intel 520 SSD is 36TB (in practice it has proven to be much higher). Hibernate writes the contents of the RAM to the SSD, so with 16 GB it writes (at most, it checks if the memory is in use and uses compression) 16 GB. 36 TB / 16 GB = 2304 times, so you can hibernate the computer 2304 times without exceeding the guaranteed write endurance. In practice however, hibernating has very little write amplification and the drive will write more than 36 TB, so it<sq>s not really a concern IMO.<br>- System restore, no idea why that would be, probably it<sq>s nonsense.<br>- Indexing the drive isn<sq>t really useful with SSD according to Microsoft AFAIK, because the seek time is so short.<br>- Defragmenting isn<sq>t useful on an SSD, only drives with slow access/seek times benefit from defragmenting. So defragmenting wastes the write endurance of the flash without providing a benefit. The one exception to this is if you want to shrink a volume. In that case you can defragment it one time.<br>- Moving the page file to the HDD is another myth. Don<sq>t do this, it negates an important part of the advantage of having an SSD. Especially if the HDD has aggressive power management your computer can misbehave (hang for seconds as the discs spins up) from doing this.</p>",

And since XP has been obsolete for years now, it is a huge security risk.<br><br>Now, as far as XP is concerned, you only have to be concerned about the motherboard. Hard drives and CPU<sq>s, although critical components, are meaningless in terms of this conversation. So, *IF* you can find a new(er) motherboard with XP support (check manufacturer<sq>s website for Windows XP drivers - if they have drivers you are good to go, if not, will be a problem) then you can move the existing system to it fairly easily (but there is a procedure).<br><br>Alternatively, since using XP on an internet connected computer is now considered a bad idea, take the chance with Win 7. You are less likely to run into a problem taking this route, since Win 7 was really good at keeping compatibility (I still run 30 year old DOS based software). Worst case scenario, install VirtualBox and setup an XP virtual machine to handle any software that just won<sq>t work in 7.<br><br><br>That being said, here is how to move the XP installation to a new motherboard<colon><br><br>* Make sure you are logged in as an administrator<br>* Install the new motherboard drivers (download from website the XP driver, usually listed as the **Chipset** utility or driver. (WARNING<colon> This *may* cause XP to no longer boot on the old system - so take a backup (clone))<br>* Run [Sysprep](http<colon>//www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/how-do-i-use-sysprep-to-create-a-windows-xp-image/)<br>* Move hard drive to new system, or install motherboard (and cpu, ram)<br>* Turn it on - 1 of 2 things will happen. 1) It will work, and it will ask for the product key, or 2) It doesn<sq>t work, and the machine won<sq>t boot (BSOD during the pulsing windows logo)<br><br>Now, officially, XP does not support moving to a new system with Sysprep, but I have had these steps work. That doesn<sq>t mean it will work for you.<br>You are probably still better off with Win 7, and dealing with any software that is incompatible. If you are concerned about having to reinstall all the software, you can attempt an upgrade installation (put the DVD in while XP is running, run Install from there) but it may be buggy, and you are limited to using a 32-bit version of Win 7, which has a 4GB memory limit. If you install Win 7 clean, you are not restricted by these limits.<br><br>You likely won<sq>t see much improvement by cloning the old HD to an SSD, simply for the fact that in virtually all boot up time issues, it<sq>s not hardware, but the years of crap installed on the system, and likely the current system bottleneck is not the HD. Speaking of the HD, if the system is that old, it is likely still using an IDE interface, which is outdated. HD<sq>s now (as well as SSDs) use the SATA interface. Also, SATA isn<sq>t just SATA. Early SATA implementations are limited to 1.5Gbps and don<sq>t support the newer SATA protocols. SATA2 is more common, at 3Gbps. However most newer HD<sq>s and motherboards run SATA3 at 6Gbps. So even if the current system is SATA, there is a good chance it won<sq>t support the SATA3 drives that are available now.<br><br><br>If it were me<colon><br><br>* Clone XP as a backup. Save this for those <dq>oh crap<dq> moments.<br>* Sysprep the machine as mentioned above (skip motherboard driver install)<br>* Clone the sysprepped XP installation to restore into virtual machine.<br>* Replace motherboard, cpu, ram, hard disk(s), optical drives (if needed due to SATA compatibilities listed above)<br>* Install Windows 7, and start installing what you can.<br>* Install VirtualBox, create a virtual machine - try to keep similar specs to the original setup. (VBox has some templates specific to OS to help)<br>* Restore the cloned sysprepped XP installation to the virtual machine.<br>* Cross fingers the XP install works in VBox.<br><br>This would update the system to something current, secure, and usable, and any software that doesn<sq>t work (or can<sq>t be reinstalled due to missing licenses or installers) will be accessible through the XP virtual machine.</p>",
