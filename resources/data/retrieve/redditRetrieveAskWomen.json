Note, I am awkward about describing genitalia.<br><br>First, there will be something that triggers it. Seeing a guy, hearing a sentence, feeling something--for example, bumping into a guy on the subway, putting a hand out to steady myself, and feeling hard muscle underneath my hand, then I look up and this gorgeous man is literally inches away. Yeah, let<sq>s run with that example.<br><br>So, first, there<sq>s the trigger, and what it specifically triggers is this... jolt. Like a zap, almost, from each of my hands and feet, zapping straight to my gut. My palms tingle and my heart starts beating faster. I draw a shaky breath through my mouth in reaction to the zap. I am hyper-aware of whatever it is that triggered me, and my attention is on it 100<percent>, though my brain feels slightly foggy. The jolt is accompanied by a feeling like my gut has dropped out of my body, a sort of <dq>whoops<dq> feeling like the one you get in a car when you go over a small hill quickly.<br><br>In public, at this point, I would blink and shake my head to clear the fog (literally, not figuratively) and focus on something else. But let<sq>s say I<sq>m in a boy<sq>s apartment, and the trigger, instead, is that we were talking, the conversation drifts to a stop, he steps forward and runs a finger down the back of my arm. (Oooh lawd.)<br><br>My breathing quickens, and I feel blood rush to my face. The room feels slightly warmer. I notice that my mouth is open and close it, biting my lip. I take another breath, shaky, to try and slow my breathing. It<sq>s not certain whether or not this arousal is going to lead anywhere. My heart is beating faster, and I start to feel my pulse, ah, down there. I cross my legs or press my knees together, look down, clear my throat. <br><br>Say, at this point, he grabs me by the hips and pulls me closer, whispering <dq>Come here.<dq> (Sweet jesus.) That<sq>s the signal, <dq>Hey, don<sq>t worry about those outward signs, it<sq>s boner time.<dq> Then I stop strapping in my body. I uncross my legs, move my knees apart, and there<sq>s this empty ache between my legs, like something<sq>s missing and I need to fill the gap. I drop my shoulders back, my mouth falls open. Almost like I<sq>m opening myself up to him in as many ways as possible. My breath comes faster, and the breathing is different from normally. My chest rises and falls, up and down, rather than out, or breathing from my gut, as I normally do. It<sq>s as if my breasts are trying to lift up, to touch him, be touched by him. The pulse between my legs is now stronger than the one in my chest. It feels hot and damp, and I can feel moisture slipping out of my (my god, this is graphic, OK, reigning it in)--er, right. Ahem.<br><br>With each movement he makes, I get another jolt, another zap.  My palms tingle, my breath shakes, the pulse between my legs gets stronger. I seek to pull him towards me, to put some part of him between my legs, to start to fill that unfilled space. My toes curl and I lick my lips, dry from the quick breaths. My hands reach for something hard and firm to curl around--no, my body reaches for something hard and firm to curl around. I feel soft and pliable and melted. My skin feels tight and sensitive, the fine hairs on my arms are tiny antennae sending unreasonable sensory input to my brain at the lightest touch. My brain is foggy as hell, my thoughts reduced to simple needs and wants. I need something between my legs, I want something pressed against me. It<sq>s an ache, and though it hurts, it feels so good.<br><br>With every moment that passes, any part of my body not being touched tingles with annoyance at being ignored, and I mentally zero in on every part being touched. I tuck my leg up, and my knee rests against his thigh, and for a moment, that connection point is my entire world, and then the rest of my body comes back into focus and screams <dq>HEY, ME, TOO!<dq> and I slide my leg along his, temporarily soothing each petulant square of skin until I wrap my calf around his leg, pulling him against my, ah, lady business. I try to touch as much of his as possible, any part untouched becoming more tingly and upset, my breath quickening, heart beating faster, until the agonizing inability to touch all of me to all of him becomes too much and a little noise escapes, an exhalation, a moan. Slightly embarrassing, slightly arousing, and it triggers another jolt.<br><br>At this point, it<sq>s a waterfall down there, and I can feel the heat reflecting back from my panties. Every touch of his hand leaves a trail of shivers in its wake, with little jolts that build until all I can feel is this pounding heartbeat between my legs. I<sq>m not thinking at all any more, just trying to feel as much as possible. It<sq>s not just a heartbeat anymore, now my muscles are flexing and pulsing along with it, almost like the throbbing after an orgasm, but intermittently, not constant.<br><br>Hopefully at this point of arousal, something is done about it, and then I<sq>d be describing sex. But I will say, that the first moment of penetration, after all that arousal and this buildup of desire to have something, anything, fill that unfilled, aching, empty space, that first moment when it<sq>s in and--that, oh god, that moment is the best moment of sex, THE best moment, like every nerve in my body is saying <dq>ahhhhhhh,<dq> and my nether regions are like <dq>YESSS MOTHERFUCKER.<dq><br><br>Anyway, that<sq>s that.<br><br>Edit<colon> Jesus christ, what happened?

The feeling of his warm body next to mine is a huge turn on. So when I start feeling aroused I have this urge to be as close to this person as I possibly can, I want to envelop him with my body. I can literally feel the rush of blood pounding in my vagina and I can feel (and sometimes smell) as I get wetter. It gets really hot down there and there<sq>s a tightening sensation that almost hurts (I<sq>ve often wondered if that<sq>s normal). I want to coil my arms and legs around this glorious male body and feel and kiss and lick and bite its warm skin. As the pounding of my blood becomes stronger I want to feel my man<sq>s hard penis but at the same time I have a huge urge to rub my clit against him. And the more my clit is stimulated the more I have the urge to have him inside of me. I don<sq>t want the rubbing of the clit to stop but I also just want to have the shit pounded out of me. The longer the man waits to stick his fingers or penis inside me the more I yearn for it and the more rewarding it feels when I can finally feel him.<br><br>I think this covers the basics of my arousal, obviously there<sq>s a bit more to it but it<sq>s really difficult to describe everything I feel. If I get aroused in public without any prospect of actually fucking I can still feel my blood in my vagina and it still becomes very warm and wet. I<sq>m always afraid people might be able to smell me. But I don<sq>t really get the urge to rip a guy<sq>s clothes off or anything. I don<sq>t really get too distracted by my arousal, it<sq>s more of an underlying theme in my chain of thought. </p>",

I want to add he is actually very caring and considerate; this is just a situation which made it very clear to me that he was very unfamiliar with what it feels like to be harassed or made to feel uncomfortable by male attention. <br><br>We had bought a washer and had it delivered, and I provided my number so they could call me when they were on their way. Delivery came, all went well, neither delivery man made me feel uncomfortable. Then after they left, I start getting texts from one of them telling me how beautiful I was and I just deserved to know, etc. It was so inappropriate, and I immediately thought <dq>If he doesn<sq>t understand how inappropriate this is, what other boundaries does he not understand and/or care about?<dq> I also want to add, I live alone with my child about 80<percent> of the time; my husband works out of state for that time. The delivery man knew that my husband works out of town a lot because he asked if I would need it hooked up and I said <dq>Yes, my husband won<sq>t be back to help for a few days.<dq> (that was dumb on my part, I know.) So I have a delivery person that pushes boundaries, hits on women he knows are married, knows where I live, knows that my husband is going to be out of town for awhile yet....And I was thoroughly freaked out. I texted screenshots of this to my husband and told him I was reporting it to the place we got our washer from and I just wanted him to know what was going on. His first response was <dq>Aww, you have a secret admirer. ;) It must make you feel good to know that guys think that about you.<dq> And while I understand why he could think that... No, sweetie. Just no. It<sq>s inappropriate. I gave him my number to provide me a service, and he used it in a way I did not consent to. Granted he probably did not have any super nefarious intentions in mind. But I don<sq>t know that. All I know is he knows my number, he knows where I live, he knows I<sq>m alone for several days at a time including the present, and he<sq>s shown me he<sq>s not afraid to push boundaries. <br><br>I can understand why my husband didn<sq>t get it... He<sq>s huge, and strong, and tough looking. No one is fucking with him, and if they did he is confident in his abilities to hold his own and get away to safety. He meant well, because in his mind someone hitting on me = I<sq>m beautiful and should feel good about that. This all just goes to show how your average guy just does not understand the plight of your average girl against creepers. My own husband did not understand how scary that was to me until I explained it to him, so it<sq>s bound to be even worse for random guys to understand the fears of random girls they don<sq>t even know. </p>",

I have a pretty face, a warm smile, a tiny waist and curvy hips, legs like a Victoria<sq>s Secret model, and I keep myself well groomed and dressed attractively.

I praise the academic accomplishments (which are many), their creative output, their interpersonal skills (I compliment them when they are kind and when they are charming, and I point out exactly what they did/said). But I also tell them how beautiful they are.  Maybe they have better self-esteem than I, but in this particular society, being physically attractive is important. <br></p>",

Her relationship with those relatives has been somewhat strained since then. When my SIL got married a few years later, my MIL wanted to again invite all of her family, but my SIL refused. If they couldn<sq>t be supportive of her brothers<sq> marriages (these relatives had also boycotted the oldest brother<sq>s wedding), then she didn<sq>t want their support for her wedding and marriage. I love my SIL.</p>",

We keep a list of cool things in the city, and when we are at a loss for things to do, we pick something from the list.  Some of it is touristy (visiting museums and landmarks), some is high brow (fancy restaurants, the symphony), some is just about weird things to do (that place where you drink while painting, taking cheesy pictures with The Bronze Fonz), and some is simple fun that we might forget to do (bowling, the driving range).<br><br>2.  We pick a director and watch all the movies from that director and talk about it at length.  This year, we are doing Fassbender.  This isn<sq>t my jam, but he loves it and if it weren<sq>t for him, I<sq>d be totally culturally illiterate.<br><br>3.  We have taken up the mutual hobby of exotic cooking.  Every few months, we pick an ethnicity or genre and dig in.  We<sq>ve made our way through Indian, Ethiopian, pickling, Thai, Chinese, German, all local, Italian, Vietnamese, pizza, Korean, French, Mexican, homemade sausage, South American, etc.  We pick a theme, and then spend months trying new recipes and ideas.  We just bought our first Serbian cookbook!<br><br>4.  Having the dogs is a boon.  Every Saturday is like an exercise in figuring out where we can take those dudes for fun.  Maybe we try the cool dog park by the biergarten, or the cute boutiques that allow dogs, or the patio of a cafe or restaurant, or a long walk and picnic by the lake.  We pretend that we are training our dogs to behave well in new environments, but really we are using them to amuse ourselves.<br><br>5.  Buy an old-ass house, AKA money pit.  Sick of sitting around on the weekends?  Fix the cracked plaster.  Bored with watching TV?  Good, because none of your electricity is grounded and you should fix that, first.  Want to do something that builds trust with your partner?  Climb up on a tall ladder and paint some fussy trim work.<br><br>6.  Volunteer for a common cause.  Maybe you walk dogs at the shelter.  Maybe you serve food at a soup kitchen.  Maybe you pick up trash at the park.  You get to be good citizens and congratulate each other for your shared moral superiority.  We do improvement projects with a local co-op.<br><br>7.  Garden.  You will have something to do, then something beautiful to look at or delicious to eat.<br><br>8.  Involve other people in your life.  Throw dinner parties.  Make Friday night poker night at your house and have people over.  Go out to dinner with another couple.  It<sq>s easier to have something to talk about if you have new and fresh ideas in the mix.<br><br>We<sq>ve been together 8 years (encroaching on 9...eep!), and it still feels like a breathless adventure sometimes.<br><br>Edit<colon> thanks for the gold!

                "answer": "<p>These suggestions are all excellent.   I<sq>ve been married 29 years -and quite happily, too.  But, have there been periods of boredom?  Definitely .  It<sq>s like sailing through the doldrums - no wind in the sails, everything is flat, and the horizon seems endless.  Yawn!  But, if you hang in and try any of the previous suggestions to find what works for you -you may prevail as a couple.  It really seems to be a twofold process -work on something that enlivens you personally, and then find something as a couple.  We have just recently become empty nesters -and it<sq>s kind of hard.  But, we have hired a personal trainer and work out together now.   We take day hikes all over our beautiful city when we can.  We also have signed up for more vacations (the benefits of old age and a stable income).  We also started to watch some great Netflix series together, even though I<sq>m not much of a series fan.  He loves it and I<sq>m happy to hang with him -plus I ended up hooked on <dq>Orange is the New Black<dq>.  <br>Groupons and Amazon local coupons are fun to try new things.  You can also do dinner parties with friends or maybe potlucks.  I love the goals idea - we have made it a goal to head into our senior years with vim and vigor.  <br>  What I do for myself is to join a women<sq>s expressive arts group and we all kinds of wacky stuff.  It makes me feel better about the times we<sq>re both hanging out doing nothing.   Good luck to you -long term relationships require lots of attention and they often run into dull periods, but they can be so worth it if you keep at it.  *** It also helps to think daily or weekly on the qualities that you really love about your SO instead of those things that bug you.  When I see my bald husband huffing and puffing at our workout place, I try to see him sitting by our very sick child for years at a time without giving up.  Suddenly, he becomes very beautiful and I don<sq>t really mind that he looks nothing like the young stud I first hooked up with.  (nor do I, but that is another story...) </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Orgasms, especially in women, can take many different forms, and detecting them is always difficult due to their differences. A G-spot orgasm may be very different to a clitoral orgasm, for instance. Compounding this is that many of these defining characteristics, such as contractions of somatic pelvic muscles (hip thrusting) can be faked. One thing that can<sq>t be faked, however, is smooth muscle contraction, so that<sq>s probably your best bet.<br><br>Smooth muscle is a special type of muscle that<sq>s not under voluntary control. It controls the size of our blood vessels, movement of food through our digestive tracts, and ejaculation (in males and females) during orgasm. You can assess its contraction by observing it, but this is difficult in the deep tissue layers of the vagina. Your best bet is to place electrodes. <br><br>If your partner has any form of vaginal piercing, this is a good place to start, as the metal is an excellent conductor of the electrical signals that will accompany her love spasms. If not, you<sq>ll need to insert the electrodes 2-3 cm (about an inch) below the skin to get good readings. Try to place them reasonably far apart. There<sq>s a very good chance she<sq>ll notice when you do this, so if possible, try to distract her by asking if she can remember who played whom in Ocean<sq>s Eleven (original or remake?). Once you<sq>ve got the electrodes positioned properly, hook them up to your recording equipment. Depending on your setup, you should be able to hide a powerlab or similar equipment under the bed while you collect your data.<br><br>Keep in mind that the electrodes must keep as still as possible during coupling, as dislodging them will muddle readings. You will probably need to change the angle and momentum of your thrust to accommodate this. Furthermore, make sure your partner doesn<sq>t move around too much, as the electrodes can<sq>t tell the difference between voluntary and involuntary contractions! If at all possible, try giving her an orgasm without touching her vagina at all.<br><br>If electrodes aren<sq>t your thing, you could also try measuring hormone levels. This is a bit tricky, and you<sq>ll need a blood sample. Technically, one taken directly after <dq>orgasm<dq> would work, however for best results you<sq>ll want to take small samples regularly throughout the course of the session to monitor more subtle changes. Remember to time and date the samples right away, and if possible in your log book, make a note of what you were doing. Eg, <dq>Sample 7B - 9<colon>17<colon>33 pm Friday 30/5/14, 30 stroke-per-minute <sq>slow<sq> pace, medium depth, longitudinal strokes with slight upward inflection at maximal insertion. Subject expressed desire for increased force and depth of thrusts.<dq> This will really help later when it comes time to analyse your work!<br><br>A single set of data will do in a pinch, and may serve to give you a crude indication of your partner<sq>s sexual arousal levels, but will severely limit the amount of statistical interpretation you can do later. As we know, the key to successful science is repetition! A larger sample size will really help boost your confidence intervals. Repeat the experiments several times, and if the option is available to you, try using different subjects, especially ones you<sq>ve previously confirmed via other methods to be definitely faking or not, as these would make valuable negative and positive controls, respectively!<br><br>This may sound like a lot of work, but it<sq>s not like we<sq>re dealing with something simple here that could be solved by basic, relationship 101-level communication. This is definitely something that needs to be handled with appropriate investigative rigour!</p>",

I live within a block of three microbreweries, and grew up within an hour<sq>s drive of probably a hundred different breweries.<br><br>There<sq>s a ton of great IPAs that come out of Colorado. [O<sq>Dell](http<colon>//odellbrewing.com/) has a really good IPA. The Myrcenary is their high booze content IPA, and I believe the IPA is just called IPA. I<sq>ve seen them in different countries, so I<sq>m sure they<sq>re available across the country. Other good breweries from Colorado include [New Belgium](http<colon>//www.newbelgium.com/Home.aspx), [Lefthand](http<colon>//lefthandbrewing.com/), [Breckenridge](http<colon>//www.breckbrew.com/agegate), and [Avery](http<colon>//averybrewing.com/). Oh my goodness, Avery has some good IPAs.<br><br>Another favorite brewery of mine in regards to IPAs is [Green Flash](http<colon>//www.greenflashbrew.com/) out of California. I<sq>ve seen them in a few places, so hopefully available nationwide. The West Coast IPA is a little bit bitter and hoppy, and then they<sq>ve got the Palate Wrecker, which is another high content, bitter, hoppy goodness. Le Freak is kind of a cross between an IPA and a Trippel, so if you<sq>re into that, it<sq>s awesome. In general, they<sq>re pretty high octane.<br><br>I also absolutely love anything by [Lagunitas](http<colon>//lagunitas.com/), also out of California, I believe. The Lil<sq> Sumpin Sumpin Ale is my absolute favorite beer of all time. It<sq>s got the right amount of hops, the right amount of bitter, the right amount of sweet, and the right amount of dark. The Cappuccino Stout is also fucking phenomenal...***IFF you get it on tap.*** In a bottle, it tastes like coffee grounds. On tap, it tastes like chocolate covered espresso beans. There<sq>s a huge difference.<br><br>I<sq>ve got to go to my job, but I could go on for ***days.***<br><br>Edit<colon> my current favorite beer is a [Red Hook Pumpkin Porter.](http<colon>//redhook.com/beers/out-of-your-gourd-pumpkin-porter/)<br><br>***Edit two because slow day at the office!***<br><br>Alright, so those are a few of my favorite IPAs. But what I really love is porters and stouts.<br><br>In terms of both, there<sq>s a ton of good stuff out of Colorado. Lefthand just won silver medals at the GABF for their Blackjack Porter (slight java notes, very chocolatey) and I believe their Milk Stout, which is next level rich and creamy. My actual favorite beer (in case you can<sq>t tell, I have a hard time deciding!) is their Wake Up Dead Nitro Stout. It<sq>s a 10<percent> stout that tastes like a 5<percent>. It<sq>s dangerous. The head on it is the perfect level of foamy and creamy, and it goes down like melted ice cream. It<sq>s a very chewy beer.<br><br>In terms of other stouts from Colorado, the O<sq>Dell Lugene Chocolate Milk Stout is to die for. On tap, it tastes like a Hershey kiss. In a bottle, it<sq>s a little bit bitter and tastes more like a 90<percent> cacao bar of chocolate. Either way, very good.<br><br>Avery has a series of bombers that they do every year that are to die for. My favorite is probably the Czar stout. It hovers around the alcoholic content of wine depending on the year (11-14<percent>), and it<sq>s another chewy beer. It tastes like dipping pumpernickel bread in chocolate wine, if that even makes sense.<br><br>Breckenridge has an amazing vanilla porter that has a vanilla flavor almost on par with Vanilla Coke. Not that it tastes like Coke, but the vanilla flavor is almost overwhelming. This is one of the few beers I have preferred in a bottle to on tap.<br><br>Old Chub is from [Oskar Blues](http<colon>//oskarblues.com/) in Colorado. Just. Best and worst nights of my life. On nitro it is amazing. Everything out of OB is fantastic, and their Mama<sq>s Lil Pilsner was the best beer nationwide last year, I believe.<br><br>There are also tons of great beers coming out of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, but I can<sq>t be bothered to list them right this second. [Snake River](http<colon>//www.snakeriverbrewing.com/) has a really good blonde, and their Zonker Stout is delicious, albeit a bit carbonated for my tastes. I much prefer creamy and chewy beers to fizzy, but it<sq>s not bad. One of my favorite Midwestern beers that you may or may not be able to get is called Bitch Creek from [Grand Teton Brewing.](http<colon>//www.grandtetonbrewing.com/) Also<colon> Moose Drool from [Big Sky Brewing.](http<colon>//bigskybrew.com/)<br><br>Other great breweries include [Sierra Nevada](http<colon>//www.sierranevada.com/), [Kona](http<colon>//konabrewingco.com/), pretty much anything from Washington or Oregon, and I<sq>m absolutely sure I<sq>m missing a ton. I<sq>m in work mode, not beer mode! Don<sq>t even get me started on Hefeweizens.<br><br>***Edit three! Fixing some mobile errors, adding links, getting started on Hefeweizens.***<br><br>So, I also like Hefes. A lot. A good Hefeweizen tastes like a citrusy banana bread. Sierra Nevada has a fucking phenomenal Hefe, as do Lefthand and Grand Teton. A lot of them are just called wheat bears, but you can tell it<sq>s a Hefe because you can see the yeast in the beer. ALWAYS drink Hefeweizen in a glass for this reason, because otherwise the yeast settles in the bottle and it<sq>s all boo. I think that the best Hefeweizen I<sq>ve ever had was the Sweaty Betty Blonde from [Boulder Beer Company.](http<colon>//www.boulderbeer.com/)<br><br>Also, I forgot to mention that my all-time favorite imported beer is [Mort Subite.](http<colon>//www.mortsubite.eu/) Give me the Kriek, give me the Framboise, just put it in my goddamn face. All Belgian Monk beers are good. Just, all of them. Kriek is a cherry beer that pairs well with dark chocolate, and Framboise is a raspberry beer that goes with everything. Both rate pretty low on the booze scale, but they<sq>re for sipping, not for getting trashed off of. Others in this category include [Lindeman<sq>s](http<colon>//www.lindemans.be/), which I absolutely love using to make beer floats with vanilla ice cream, and anything from [Rochefort.](http<colon>//www.abbaye-rochefort.be/)</p>",

I just followed some simple social rules. <br><br>1. Girls aren<sq>t gonna show up to a house with a bunch of dudes who will get them drunk and try to have sex with them. No. Change your attitude. <br><br>2. Have close female friends ( I am not talking about fwbs or gfs although they work fine as well). As in go and talk to your neighbors who are girls. Get along with them.  On the weekend invite them over. You don<sq>t have to hook up with them. Just get to know them. Have fun with them. <br><br>3. It takes chicks to bring chicks to a party. Remember point 2 ? When these girls show up tell them to invite their friends. If their friends are guys, that<sq>s fine. Let the girls be comfortable around you. Remember your main goal is not to mack on them but to rather get to know these girls. Build up a solid network. <br><br>4. Don<sq>t just have beer. Have margaritas, chick drinks, fruity sky. Have games at your party, BP, Kings Cup, etc. <br>Have options of just soft drinks like coke or sprite and have other options like hookah. Make your parties fun.<br><br>5. My personal favorite <colon> have activities that you can do with them other than inviting them over for parties. For me I love cooking and baking ( FUCK YOU IF YOU<sq>RE JUDGING ). Cooking and baking are my stress relievers. Invite your female friends that you<sq>re close with ( could be your female neighbors ) to a cooking night where you two could cook together. I have had a lot of very stuck up friends, religious friends who do not party, drink, etc but they would love to cook with me. I am not talking about a 7 coarse meal here but just something small like [paella](http<colon>//iamafoodblog.com/paella-recipe/) or [cookies](https<colon>//www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/18476/Original-NESTLE-TOLL-HOUSE-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies/detail.aspx). <br><br>6. This is just for me personal but be someone the girls can trust. By that I mean, someone they can feel safe around, hang out with , without the obiligation of having sex. <br><br>Main lesson <colon> Be more fun yourself, invite your neighbors, expand your social circle and remember **girls bring girls**.  <br><br>How did I do ladies ? </p>",

There are those who judge others for being either too promiscuous or not promiscuous enough, but that has nothing to do with the general attitudes of the country and more to do with someone being different.  You<sq>ll find a wide spectrum of attitudes toward sexual relationships all across the country. <br><br>2) It<sq>s alright to give friends advice about relationships if they ask.  Some people can handle straightforward advice, others need to have it be stated in a more considerate way; that varies with personalities, so it all depends on the types of people you consider friends.<br><br>3) Reddit is not a good gauge of male attitudes toward women.  The world itself is not like that, but I can offer one possible explanation as to why some would think this, and it has to do with the perception of masculinity in the US (and possibly elsewhere) as men grow up, along with women<sq>s fear of men emotionally overreacting when women express disinterest.  <br><br>Most men grow up in the US with this idea that men should be closed off emotionally and not talk about their feelings, as it is seen as a very feminine thing to do.  So more often than not, men have a difficult time both expressing their feelings adequately in a healthy way, and recognizing the difference between simple friendliness and flirting when it comes to women.  Most reddit men tend to be emotionally stunted like this, so that<sq>s likely why it seems to pop up here a lot more.  It<sq>s not often like that in real life.<br><br>Some women also use friendliness as a way to potentially defuse a situation that they feel worried about in regards to unknown men.  It<sq>s unfortunate that there have been many women who have used friendliness (often mistaken for flirting) because if they say <dq>No<dq> straight out to a guy, there could be the potential for retaliation, either emotionally or physically.  So the cycle of <dq>leading on<dq> is perpetuated until men can learn to not overreact and handle their feelings in a mature way.  <br><br>4) For some, the parent thing is an issue, for others it isn<sq>t.  Some couples simply ignore their families and do their own thing because they know what would happen if they got together, others go through the whole wedding process in spite of family disagreements.  It all depends on whether or not your family<sq>s happiness is a significant factor in the happiness you share with your spouse.  </p>",

I thought it was sweet, and the sex was **FUCKING INCREDIBLE**. Please keep this in mind while you<sq>re reading.<br><br>I<sq>ve posted about this guy before, but anyway. He was like 5<sq>2<dq> and, at least to me, not extremely attractive. I was actually in no way attracted to his looks, but my roommate said he was cute so he<sq>s probably not that bad? We started dating around early December, I<sq>ll try to keep things in order.<br><br>I made it pretty clear that I wanted sex and that was it, this was a no-commitment deal. He claimed he wanted the same things from me and then would go and do the opposite. On our third date we went to go see Christmas lights and he made a comment about <dq>Our house is going to look this amazing.<dq> which scared the shit out of me, but he said it was a joke so I brushed it under the rug. When we got back to my place he gave me some presents to wrap and when I finished he told them they were for me/my roommate/my parents. Not kidding. I didn<sq>t know how to react so I didn<sq>t see this as a red flag until later.<br><br>We<sq>re both gamers and friends on steam, and he would message me every time he was online. If I didn<sq>t respond he would text me. He would in-game stalk me if I was playing an mmo. As in he<sq>d dl it and then ask me server info and then BOOM he was suddenly in the same guild. He would get jealous if I talked to other guild members. He also begged me to do the same to him, so I stopped playing most of my MMO<sq>s and started playing more one player games. <br><br>It was probably his second time to my apartment, he decided he was going to put hearthstone on my pc for me. So he started dl<sq>ing the game <dq>for me<dq> and a few other battlenet games he wanted me to play. He did this all without asking me though, and my c<colon> drive is full, but that<sq>s where he installed them. UGHhhhh. He also logged me out of my steam account and on to his so we could <dq>share games<dq>? Which I am not super big on the steam community, but I have never heard of that being a thing. He ALSO dissed me for not having a ducky keyboard. Ugh. UGH. The sex though guys. <br><br>On our like maybe 5th date, I had him come over for new years (ringing in the new years with seeeeeeexxxxx). My washing machine broke that night and his phone was apparently dead so I didn<sq>t know when he got there to be let into the apartment/he couldn<sq>t call to tell me. So he *snuck into my apartment*. I walked into my living room and dude was just there. <br><br>We went on two just-us dates, and both of them dude was like super in my p biz. He would grab my ass when he<sq>d talk to any guys or if anyone even looked at me. <br><br>I<sq>m gonna stop right here to say the sex was hands down the best I have ever had. I know you<sq>re judging me for staying <colon>(<br><br>I pretty much pulled the plug when I woke up one night to him fingering me *in my sleep*. He was at a weird angle and he scratched my clit all up with his nail. <br><br>After I ended it he berated me for MONTHS to get back with him. I unfriended him on steam and he<sq>s tried refriending about six times now. Including last Monday. <br><br>Sex isn<sq>t worth it guys. Never stay for sex. Please learn from my mistakes.

                "answer": "<p>My husband and I have been together for 17 years, married for 12. We have a one year old and a 3 year old. It took us 10 years of trying to get pregnant the first time. I thought that it taking so long would be a blessing in disguise. We had time to build our relationship, we did trips and concerts, we were spontaneous. Admittedly, I spoiled him, and ignored red flags. I put him first, always, and he relied on me. <br><br>After our son was born, he checked out. Staying out 4 or 5 nights a week until 5am. My son and I were sleeping on the couch, because he<sq>d get angry if the baby woke up at night. I finally insisted (after far too long) that we talk about it. He said he didn<sq>t want to be married, & that he wanted my son and I to leave. We did, but even when we lived apart, we talked daily. We<sq>d been best friends for most of our lives, and it turned out that neither of us really knew how to separate. A few months later, he was begging me to come back. I did, & surprise! Got pregnant with my daughter. <br><br>Things were ok for a month or so, and then he fell back into old patterns. Going out all the time. Getting angry at me for pregnancy symptoms. Yelling at our son. 2 weeks after I had our daughter, he told me that he<sq>d been having an affair and wanted to be with her. He said he<sq>d never loved me, wasn<sq>t attracted to me, & regretted marrying me. He said the reason he begged for me to come back was because it pissed him off that I was moving in more quickly than he was. He moved out, & there was a lot of animosity. About 4 months later, the kids and I came home from a trip and he<sq>d moved back in. <br><br>So here we are. Honestly, for the last 6 months or so, he<sq>s really been trying. He<sq>s only going out once or twice a month. He tries to be sweet and friendly to me. He<sq>s still no help with the kids, beyond occasionally playing with them. He still has a temper. <br><br>Honestly, I<sq>m done. I<sq>m not happy, and while I still love him, it<sq>s no longer a romantic love. The one thing that keeps me <dq>in<dq> is the kids. I<sq>m a sahm, and I<sq>ve only ever hired babysitters once or twice. The only time he<sq>s taken care of our son on his own (never our daughter) is when he<sq>s asleep. I don<sq>t think it<sq>s fair, and I can<sq>t stand the thought of going entire days without seeing my children. It<sq>s not what I signed up for when having kids, and I don<sq>t think that the kids and I should have to sacrifice our time together, and their care & wellbeing, just because he changed his goalposts. <br><br>I know it<sq>s not sustainable. I can<sq>t stay in a miserable relationship forever. But I figure if I can hold out until both kids are in school, at least they<sq>ll require less hands-on care, and they can both articulate to me if something goes wrong at dad<sq>s. In the meantime, I focus on them, bide my time, & get my ducks in a row. </p>",

I petitioned the court to be allowed to leave the state and  still get child support. It was granted. I told my ex where we were moving, gave him my number, and didn<sq>t hear from him or get child support ever. Eventually I petitioned the court to terminate my ex<sq>s rights so my husband could adopt them. *My ex fought it, saying our children were too young to understand, but he wanted a relationship when they got older.* The judge absolutely tore him a new one, saying you don<sq>t get to CHOOSE when you<sq>re a parent.<br><br><br>My twins are teenagers.

Also, my ex<sq>s mom, my twins grandma, was a *lovely* kind involved grandma until her death (which is where my twins met their birth dad, at her funeral). She never made it awkward and I<sq>m grateful for all her help and support over the years. <br><br>TLDR Had twins with a casual boyfriend. Broke up. Married and moved away.

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m 23 and probably a solid 8.5/10. I used to be obese, so I am very aware of the differences of being a hot/ugly girl. <br><br>I don<sq>t know if the entire article is accurate, but here are a few points that stood out to me<colon><br><br>* <dq>success with any particular girl \u2014 especially really hot girls \u2014 is more determinant on her willingness and receptiveness to men IN GENERAL than your specific approach or the way you present yourself.<dq><br><br>He hit the nail on the head there. Some nights, I<sq>m looking to have fun with friends or I have to work the next day. Other nights, I just want to go and get laid/<dq>meet someone.<dq> I think PUA stuff misses the mark on this in general because it assumes that a woman is always open to being approached, and if she isn<sq>t, then she always isn<sq>t, does that make sense? Well, it<sq>s not true. Some nights, Joe Schmo is going to get luckier with me, and it has nothing to do with his approach and everything to do with me.<br><br>* <dq>having to put up over and over again with people approaching you and bringing absolutely nothing interesting or attractive to the table. It gets tedious and frustrating. And it\u2019s nothing personal either.<dq><br><br>That is absolutely true. The reason why there<sq>s a trope of bitchy hot girls is not because you, random guy, are a worthless, awful human being, but because she<sq>s had so many ... losers? come up to her, and she<sq>s bracing herself for another one. It<sq>s not personal, she<sq>s just sick of the same bullshit, and she just assumes you are the same.<br><br>* Is what he described accurate to what life is like for you?<br><br>This would be accurate if you were talking about women who constantly were in areas where approaching was considered OK-- like a 24/7 bar. This isn<sq>t what life is like for women all of the time because men don<sq>t <dq>run down the street<dq> to literally chase us. When I<sq>m at Starbucks, even if the barista thinks I<sq>m the hottest thing in the entire world, he<sq>s not going to come sit on my lap or whatever because it would clearly be inappropriate. So, the article is inaccurate in the sense that men are not super aggressive all of the time, day in, day out, because they probably don<sq>t want some restraining order against them. <br><br>However, he was accurate in that he walked around knowing that he could get with pretty much any of the girls. I used to be obese and am now hot, and I think I do act or react differently knowing that most men who talk to me/know me would sleep with me if I were open to the idea.<br><br>* Anything he completely doesn<sq>t take into consideration that changes the experience?<br><br>So, in Thailand, this guy was essentially a 10 in a sea of 1<sq>s and 2<sq>s. There were way more Thai girls than Western men. That is not going to be true almost anywhere. If you<sq>re a female 10/10, there are places like LA, NYC, Miami, Las Vegas where there are other 10<sq>s... and 9.9<sq>s, 9.8<sq>s... you see what I<sq>m saying? Even if you<sq>re really attractive, there are other really attractive women around you. That changes things, because if you<sq>re a 9 with a crappy personality, the guy in question could just turn around and talk to the really cool 8.5 or whatever. <br><br>Essentially, Thai women (from the article) value <dq>Western<dq>-ness over most things, and there aren<sq>t many Westerners. Guys don<sq>t value looks above all things to the point that *in every situation*, the 10/10 is going to beat out the 9, 8 7... /10. It might be more likely to happen, but in my experience, once you<sq>re <dq>hot enough,<dq> personality matters a lot more. <br><br>* Is it true you can just go out and get sex from almost whomever whenever?<br><br>Well, yes and no. I could go on Tinder right now or to a bar tonight, and if my goal is to have sex, I know it could happen. That being said, if my goal is to have sex with Specific Guy A, that might not happen for a combination of factors (he has a gf, he<sq>s not interested in me, he<sq>s out of town)... Also, I<sq>m going to be selective and have sex with the people I want to have sex with, which narrows it down. So<colon> if my goal was to get laid by anyone, I could do it. If my goal is to get laid by someone I am physically and emotionally attracted to (and in this hypothetical situation, I<sq>m not using anyone I already know), then it depends on many factors outside my control.<br><br>* How does this affect your view of sex? Does it make it less appealing than it might be for a guy who doesn<sq>t have that ability? Does it affect how you filter out who you might be interested in having sex with?<br><br>Well, sex is sex, I<sq>m not sure how it affects my views apart from that I know I have standards. I don<sq>t think it makes sex less appealing, but it does make bad sex less appealing. I mean, knowing that 99<percent> of the people I know would welcome me into their beds allows me to be more selective.<br><br>* If there is constant attention, what is it like dealing with it? Does it feel like harassment every day?<br><br>Well because of general etiquette, it<sq>s not harassment like what<sq>s described in the article, because men don<sq>t literally chase women down the street, or even hug women they don<sq>t know. I suppose that if that were the case, it would feel like harassment.<br><br>It depends on the day. There are some times/places that I<sq>d rather be invisible and not chat with a random guys, and there are some days where I feel validated. You deal with it the same way that you deal with everything unwanted in life, politely but firmly. <br><br>* Lastly, if there is constant attention, how does that affect validation? Does it make it more difficult to feel validated or easier? For example, if you<sq>re having a shit day and feel down on yourself, would you ever go out for a night just because you know you can get the validation of having guys pay you attention and effort to try and have sex with you?<br><br>Well, the way it affects validation is that I don<sq>t feel validated because the homeless guy tells me I<sq>m beautiful or whatever. If I want to be validated, I want to be validated by someone I consider around an equal. <br><br>Personally, I<sq>m a firm *no* on the third question. I realize I am worth more than my looks, so if I<sq>m feeling sad, my reaction is not to turn around and go to a bar and get Joe Schmo to tell me I<sq>m hot. I do something that makes me feel good (and usually isn<sq>t related to outward validation for my looks). <br><br>On that note, being validated for my looks doesn<sq>t have to be so obvious as a random guy buying me a drink. In terms of being validated solely through looks, I<sq>d rather catch hot and cool Peter from Marketing staring at me 3x during a meeting than some random guy at a bar telling me I<sq>m cute.<br><br>* Or does this cheapen the whole thing and make it more difficult to find someone with whom you feel you can genuinely connect with?<br><br>Nope. Here<sq>s the least-secret secret ever<colon> it<sq>s a lot easier to <dq>connect<dq> with someone when you<sq>re attractive, simply because everyone is open to connect with you. The percentage of people I have a genuine connection with remains the same, but now I know that that more of that population is available to me because the number of them that are likely to connect with me is higher, if that makes sense. <br><br>So, it<sq>s just as difficult to *find* that person, but once you<sq>ve <dq>found<dq> him, it<sq>s easier because he is probably interested too. <br><br>EDIT<colon> wow, thanks so much for the gold!!

Are you attracted strongly to either Dominating or being Dominated? Would you like a regular sexual partner and repeat sex, or prefer to explore with different one night stands?<br><br>How you go about searching for a partner depends on what you want. I actually like OKCupid for this. I state directly on my profile the exact kind of casual encounter I<sq>m looking for, and then sort through the messages to see who is equally direct with me and seems to also want what I want.<br><br>For someone I meet in person, once I think I feel chemistry, I pretty much just tell them<colon> <dq>So, I can be overly direct, feel free to tell me off if you<sq>d like. I think you<sq>re fucking hot and I<sq>d like to [x, y, z] with you. If you<sq>d be interested, let me know.<dq> Then I return to whatever our previous conversation was and let them follow up if they want.</p>",

I know I<sq>m now totally messing up your schedule but let<sq>s do something FUN!<dq>. Of course, mom will be scoffing and shaking her head a little bit to play the grump, but then they always went out and did something weird they never had time for (like shop for the best pumpkins during autumn season or giggly try on unisex hiking clothes at the survival shop).<br><br>* They also have an archive of fun stuff they want to do together. This can be anything from bigger outings (city trips) to medium stuff (go to a museum) and to really casual things (reading books together in the evening). Every time they think of something, they write it down on a note, and whenever they want to change it up or don<sq>t know what to do, they randomly pull 3-4 notes from the <dq>archive<dq> and then pick one.<br><br>* Communication. My mom is especially good at this, and my dad is getting better. I.e., just admitting that stuff is getting repetitive<colon> <dq>I am in a slump right now and I<sq>m annoyed. What are we going to do about it?<dq> is something my mom will just blurt out at times. And then my dad starts shooting ideas (<dq>You wanna go to the movies? What do you want to change about the situation right now? I<sq>d like to go on walks in the evening more if possible<dq>).<br><br>* Dancing and having fun. It was pretty normal around our house if a good tune came up during household chores (cooking, doing the dishes, etc.) we would just randomly break out into song and dance. This still happens with mom and dad swirling around the living room carpet as if it<sq>s a dancefloor. Don<sq>t be afraid to be lighthearted and take your SO for a spin through the house with the vacuum cleaner still in one hand (watch out where you step, though).<br><br>**EDIT 1<colon>** Thanks for all the upvotes!

I *am* a feminist (booo, hisss- tomatos and etc) I am planning on voting for Sanders (huzzah- she sees the light- her soul is not forfeit) HOWEVER, this comment is solely about Steinem<sq>s incredibly hyporitical statement due to her being a leading figure within feminism and my opinion of it as one single person<br><br> that does not negate ALL THE THINGS she has done for women over the years for women and for feminism. I *personally* have lost respect for her for reasons stated in another comment which I will not repeat here. It does NOT mean feminism is a sham or that all or most feminists are hypocrits. It does not mean I believe all or most women who are voting Clinton are doing so because she<sq>s a woman. I believe the vast majority of women - exclusifng *a very few* who are voting for Clinton, do so because they believe in her incredible record- as a *person* not as a woman- who has the most impressive resume for president, basically ever. Starting when she was in her teens volunteering for campaigns, getting a law degree, her carving something out of the <dq>office<dq> of first lady that had never been done before, as a senator and Secretary of state and more- you can<sq>t deny her accomplishments or experience. <br><br>I<sq>m voting for Sanders for a lot of reasons. Mostly because I<sq>m a super ridiculous lefty, I don<sq>t believe most centrists will trust Clinton after Whitewater, Lewinsky (yes not her fault, but for some reason that has remained a stain on her and not her husband who is still idolized) I think she cynically panders to minorities banking on her husband<sq>s recors with the black community and *especially* on her own gender for women- and her ties with wall street. I like Sanders Because I think he gets people energized- I think he is the outside voice that democrats need. <br><br>I *HOPE* that all you folks who are upvoting me because of this stupid ass statement by Steinem will actually go out and fucking vote- and I especially hope you do again *when it really fucking matters* which would be the MIDTERM elections. Y<sq>all went out and voted for Obama then left him dangling in the wind. DON<sq>T DO THAT AGAIN. you can<sq>t make change happen unless you<sq>re committed- and ffs as an american that commitment requires one goddamn day per year. <br><br>So y<sq>all can stop responding to this comment. You can stop falsely equating it to all kinds of other shit- you can stop pm-ing me. [That<sq>s all I have to say about it.](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/AbhjZSm.gif) </p>",

She would be whisked away to a huge mansion where she would be forced to stay in a beautiful bedroom and wear amazing gowns (but she totally hated it all because she was such a tomboy and this amazing dress showed too much cleavage and clashed with her special, mismatched eyes of turquoise and lavender - totally normal).

Sometimes shed come across an equally dreamy and terrifying rival vampire. Oh god, so much inner turmoil. Which one would she choose?<br><br>And this was all *so common*.

                "answer": "<p>I had one several years ago. I was in college, the father said he had other things he wanted to do first.there was no sense of wanting it or impending motherhood. It was closer to being diagnosed with something fatal. I just wanted it gone.   <br><br>We went to a planned parenthood nearby. They<sq>re both friendly and stark lonely places. The receptionist was behind bullet proof glass but she asked me if it was okay to call the number I had provided or should they pretend to be someone else. They care, truly, about the fate of the *woman* and understand she may not be coming there from a safe and understanding place.   <br><br>The doctor was a woman, a Catholic, she told me. I hadn<sq>t learned yet to tense myself mentally for the hate and the shame catholics or conservatives would causally throw at me. I would, but then I didn<sq>t need to. She was so kind. She said someday I was going to be a wonderful mother but that just wasn<sq>t right now. She told me I was going to be okay.   <br><br>I was 6 weeks. She did an ultrasound and assured me the fetus was maybe the size of half my pinky fingernail. She asked if I wanted a print out. My boyfriend at the time said keeping evidence like that lying around was a mistake. I said I did. I remember thinking I needed a marker. Someone needed to stop and take notice.   <br><br>Under 9 weeks and you just take a series of pills. The first blocks progesterone which halts the pregnancy in its tracks. The second (taken the next day, in my private dorm room with only my then boyfriend to supervise) contracts the uterus expelling everything. The doctor took great pains to tell me I<sq>d see clots, maybe some as big as my fist, but that it absolutely was not the fetus. It would be too small to pick out.   She said it would be painful and prescribed me pain pills to help with the pain. I resolved mentally not to take them. It<sq>s never too soon to start nailing yourself to your cross. <br><br>I took the pill. I remember thinking I should ask for alone time so I could say goodbye. I felt like I was letting it down. I had this one job and I wasn<sq>t up to it. I didn<sq>t ask for alone time. They also give you antibiotics to ward off infection as your body sheds a bunch of dead tissue and blood. We stopped at the stop and shop for soup and other sick-in-bed foods. Part way through shopping I became violently nauseous. I shoved my debit card into his hands, blurting the pin, and running for the car. I made it to the car and managed to get inside and lean out the passenger door in order to vomit.   <br><br>Back in my little dorm, I took the expelling pill. The pain made lying still impossible,are staying silent impossible. I had roommates (suite of private rooms) and one of them had already called me evil for my pro choice views even before that day. I was terrified of anyone finding out. I took the pain pills, I couldn<sq>t stop shaking, I was cold. My then boyfriend topped me with all the blankets I had and then when the didn<sq>t stop the shaking, he got laundry and piled that on.   <br><br>I needed help going to the bathroom, I stood as straight as I could to walk to the bathroom so no one would see. It fucking hurt so much. I don<sq>t remember much about that day  except I think we got Chinese food first. And he put on Indiana Jones while I was in bed.   <br><br>Things go on. If I had to give you one piece of advice, it<sq>s this <colon> don<sq>t go through this alone. If you<sq>re struggling to cope go find someone to talk to. I never realized my behavior, hiding liquor bottles, binge drinking, drinking alone, were problematic until much later. My failure to cope appropriately nearly killed me.  I let myself be walled off and I was too proud to seek help. I<sq>m lucky to be alive today.   <br><br>You are going to be okay. Nearly 10 years later and I believe it to be both the best and the worst thing to have happened to me. I don<sq>t regret the choice at all, never once. </p>",

I<sq>ll share my story, but if you have any questions, please let me know!<br><br>Over the summer I had an issue with my spine which left me unable to sit upright. We found out it was a herniated disc. We tried all non-surgical options first (physical therapy, steroid injections, narcotic pain meds, etc). Eventually it got worse, so we ended up having to schedule surgery to fix the issue. The day of the surgery, my parents and boyfriend were at the hospital with me. They did a pregnancy test (routine procedure before an operation). After a while, they had asked everyone to leave and spoke to me privately. Turns out my test came back positive. I asked them to bring my boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) in. I told him. We both cried (happy tears). It was a shock, but I wasn<sq>t scared. We want to have kids, so I think initially we were going to keep it. My mom even said she was thrilled. Not the best timing, but a happy surprise.<br><br>After speaking with my doctors, it was clear that they would not move forward with the much needed surgery. If I were to keep the child, I was risking permanent nerve damage to myself. Additionally, we met with my OB, and she explained that with all the meds I<sq>d been on, and all the procedures I<sq>ve already had done, that it was unlikely that the fetus would be viable. We scheduled the abortion for the following week.<br><br>When in the room for the procedure, there were several nurses with me, getting me ready. I turned to one of them and asked if I would remember the procedure. She responded <dq>it<sq>s my job to make sure that you don<sq>t<dq>. That is the last thing I remember. Afterwards, I had some cramping and general discomfort, but that passed within a few days. Physically, the procedure itself wasn<sq>t too bad. I<sq>m lucky that I had really good care-my doctors made sure I was comfortable. <br><br>For me, it was an extremely hard decision to make. I<sq>m still pretty heartbroken about it. Luckily my partner has been supportive. I know it<sq>s different for everyone, and some women are not as heartbroken about it (that<sq>s OK too!). Just remember whatever you<sq>re feeling is normal, every woman handles it differently.

I thought my first boyfriend was my soul mate. But we were kids, we didn<sq>t know anything about life or about ourselves even.

Love starves if other aspects of it are unhealthy.<br><br>By the time I met my husband, I had a much better idea of what I wanted in a partner, and what I wanted for myself out of life. And my husband did too, so our relationship matured much more quickly. I also got to see how we handled real <dq>grown up<dq> life challenges together, which was reassuring. This may be why people<sq>s dating-to-marriage timelines get shorter as they get older. I don<sq>t doubt that sometimes people just marry whoever because they want to have kids and are running out of time, and I also knew a woman who swore she would not turn 30 without a ring on her finger. But I also think it<sq>s valid that more experienced adults can come to a decision about marriage more quickly. <br><br>But it<sq>s as you say, you never really know. My sister in law was with her boyfriend for 6 years, they owned a home together, adopted a dog not too long ago. We were expecting them to announce an engagement any day.

There were things I enjoyed he just was not into such as computer technology, dancing which in my area pretty much means going to bars, and crochet. While we were dating, he told me he did not believe in drinking anything because even the smallest amount would be impairing, but didn<sq>t have a problem with me or others drinking and often went with me to bars dancing. We normally went around twice a month and I never drank more than one alcoholic beverage. He was just completely uninterested in my technological and crochet pursuits. He was always gracious when I took time to go meet with a group of friends who liked to crochet, or got wrapped up in technology studies. He was also very positive and supportive of me in my job.<br><br>As soon as we got married, he just changed. We went to the bar dancing the week after we got married and as soon as my drink arrived started in on how <dq>even a drop impairs you, know what I<sq>m saying? I just don<sq>t know how people can deal with that. What if we had children who got hurt or ill and needed you desperately.<dq> He harped a lot about that, and then started in how <dq>Sluts like to hang out in bars, know what I<sq>m saying?<dq> In the end, the evening was so depressing I stopped planning to go.<br><br>About a month later a computer professional organization I had been a member of for years had their monthly meeting. I didn<sq>t think anything of going just as I always had. To be polite I shut off my phone during the meeting. When I turned it back on I had 38 messages. He threw a fit claiming it was wrong for <dq>MY wife<dq> to be anywhere there might be single males he didn<sq>t know. <dq>Know what I<sq>m saying?<dq><br><br>Around that time my work had a slow down. He actually told me <dq>Why don<sq>t you quit? Surely you<sq>d rather just stay home and work on being a good wife. Why work in an office full of men, know what I<sq>m saying?<dq> <br><br>The next day he ran into a friend from my crochet circle. He said something to her about missing me when I was with them, and she suggested I take up crochet like the husbands of two of my friends. He came home and threw a fit that I had lied to him about my group, which was not true at all. I invited him to come with me, he expressed his lack of interest, and told me to enjoy as I was leaving to go by myself way back when we were first a serious couple. I wasn<sq>t certain I<sq>d ever said we were all women then, but I might have. The men had started participating later and since I had no reason to think he needed to vet members of my friends group, I just never mentioned it apparently. I was really rather surprised he wasn<sq>t aware as it wasn<sq>t a secret at all in our friends group. He<sq>d even had one of the men tell him a half-finished item left out on the sofa was his laughingly, but claimed because we all laughed he thought it was just a joke.<br><br>At this point everything I did seemed to be under scrutiny, and he had just a constant litany of negative comments which somehow always ended in <dq>Know what I<sq>m saying?<dq>. He would offer to help fold and hang laundry, then spend the entire time talking about how slutty dresses he had previously complimented me on were and just generally make a pain of himself no matter what I was doing. Then he would get mad because I wasn<sq>t interested in sex which he blamed on my work. <dq>Know what I<sq>m saying?<dq><br><br>The final straw was one day soon after. I had a half day off for a doctor visit and he told me when leaving for work he<sq>d be home at 5 pm hungry so I should have dinner on the table. He didn<sq>t say it in a bossy way, and I just took it as he was hopeful since I had a blood test requiring me to fast. We often came home pretty hungry after long hours, and I just put it down to that. <br><br>After my appointment I fixed supper and for once managed to gauge it so everything was sitting on the table hot and perfectly prepared on the dot of five. By five-thirty, I was so hungry I fixed myself a small plate of food and ate it furtively over the kitchen sink so I could wash the plate and put it away before he arrived home. At six I called his work and discovered he had left. When he wasn<sq>t home ten minutes later from his workplace five minutes from home, I called his cell phone. In those days you still paid by the minute, so I had put off the expensive call. Come to find out he was at the home of his ex, who<sq>s husband was out of the country for a year, <sq>helping her out with honey dos<dq>. This ex had lamented to me she hadn<sq>t hung on to him when she had the chance at our wedding. <br><br>He was furious when I told him it seemed funny I wasn<sq>t allowed at a professional meeting in a public place with men he didn<sq>t know by myself, but ok for him to spend hours alone with a lonely woman who had made it clear she still had feelings for him. He went on at length that he knew there had to be something wrong with me for ever thinking *he* would ever do anything, but his concern for me was because I might not realize what some of those men were thinking up. The absolute last straw was him sort of lurking over me and saying <dq>Know what I<sq>m saying?<dq>. He said that and I just snapped. I threw him out that night and filed for divorce the next day. Looking back I don<sq>t even know why I put up with that crap for nearly six months, but I was young and afraid of having to admit to my family and friends I<sq>d made a mistake with my marriage. </p>",

There were quite a few weddings where the husband was obviously gay and those were the most disheartening.

I had three roommates<colon> Apple, Orange and Melon.<br><br>* Apple- Apple was clever. She refused to stop smoking weed, but knew the university had a heavy fine for being caught smoking legal or illegal, so she mainly squatted at her dealer<sq>s apartment and I had no problem with that.<br>* Orange- She was from a VERY small town, was easily intimidated and simply wanted to be left alone. We get alone just fine.<br>* Melon- Melon was the problem.<br><br>When you applied to the dorms, you checked off what you liked and disliked in terms of noise level/study habits and guests. Apple, Orange, and I all wanted quiet, no guests and we all took school very seriously. Melon wrote the same thing on her application, but that was a lie. She wanted to party and she wanted to party hard.<br><br>It started with her leaving her room for days at a time, and not turning off her laptop, which played an Adhan (Muslim call to prayer) 5 times a day and had to be shut off manually. At first, it wasn<sq>t bothersome, everyone makes mistakes and a quick call to the RA and she came down, keys in hand and turned it off. But, it began happening 5 days a week and finally, I complained that this was driving me insane. Melon was given orders to fix the problem, she turned the function off.<br><br>Cleanliness<colon> There were 2 bathrooms to a dorm room and Apple and I shared, so I basically had my own bathroom, and Orange and Melon shared. Orange tried once to ask Melon to clean the bathroom and Melon snapped and began screaming at her, threatening her and this began the bullying (I didn<sq>t learn about this for months).<br><br>Revenge the first<colon> I walked into the dorm room and smelled pot. I checked Apple<sq>s room, since she openly admitted to smoking and she was squatting still. Orange wasn<sq>t in and that left one person. I put my ear to the door and heard a large group of people and turns out, Melon decided to have a <sq>pot party<sq>, fully knowing that the 4 of us agreed to have no smoking at all. The fine was huge, and I hate the smell of any smoke. I casually walked down to the RA<sq>s room and told her I smelled smoke from Melon<sq>s room and I had some papers RA needed to sign anyway, so why not come to my room and sign the papers. RA comes, smells smoke, opens door and finds the smoking and Melon is busted with a 600$ fine.<br><br>Revenge the second<colon> Melon liked friends, and she liked having her friends over. But never at reasonable times, she would invite her friends over at 3-4AM, during midterms, finals and they<sq>d be loud. I got sick of this immediately and I tried asking Melon to have people over when her roommates weren<sq>t sleeping. She told me to <dq>go fuck myself<dq> and if I wasn<sq>t having people over at 3-4AM, I must have no friends. Not sure about that logic. So, after she invited a bunch of guys over who began yelling to each other about what food to order, I got my revenge. She left her keycard on the table and these cards had to be swiped to get into the building and your personal room. The first time, I simply de-magnetised the card and the second time, I threw the card away. A replacement card cost 40$ This wasn<sq>t working, so I came up with a better plan<colon> I de-magnetized the new card so when she tried to come into the dorm room at 3AM with a bunch of drunk assholes, the card didn<sq>t work and she began banging on the door and rattling the knob. This time I called the RA and security and said I thought someone was breaking in. Caught with a bunch of drunks that early and with that level of noise cost her 150$ in fines.<br><br>Revenge the third<colon> No animals were allowed in the dorm. I was hearing scratching noises and I was worried about mice or rats (Melon was filthy in terms of food disposal and storage) and I knew she wasn<sq>t home but she<sq>d propped her door open. I poked my head in and lo and behold, there is a rodent of some sort (gerbil or hamster) in a massive cage. I got pissed off because there carpet had urine and faeces on it and I<sq>m fairly sure that urine and faecal matter probably could carry some sort of disease. I closed the door and called RA and said there was a scratching in our room and I was worried about rodents. RA came and opened Apple<sq>s door, finding nothing. My room had nothing and Orange<sq>s room had nothing. But Melon had a rodent! That was a 500$ fine for the animal and something else for carpet cleaning.<br><br>I think Melon began to get suspicious of me, I always made sure that it was other people busting her and I always planned things well. If she did, she never tried anything. But I was unaware that Melon was taking her anger out on Orange. I liked Orange a lot, she was sweet, shy and could not be mean if she tried. I was writing an essay once and I heard noise that was louder than my headphones and I slid them off and heard Melon SCREAMING and threatening Orange. I opened my door and saw Orange in the corner, crying and trying to ball up and Melon was standing over her just shrieking, I called the RA (for non nefarious purposes!) and grabbed Orange and let the RA restrain Melon. This time a big meeting was called and Orange spilled everything<colon> Melon was stealing toiletries from her, eating Orange<sq>s food etc etc.<br><br>The rules were set<colon><br><br>* No guests in the room from 9pm to 9am (Melon was furious)<br>* Melon had to pay Orange for the toiletries and food<br>* Melon was told that one more toe out of line would incur a massive fine<br>* We were all told to basically stay away from each other<br>* When final exam time came, no guests period. For anyone.<br><br>I felt really guilty that I never knew what Orange was going through, I apologized a lot and I kept watch.<br><br>My last revenge<colon> At this point, we were getting close to the end of the school year and Melon<sq>s parents were calling a lot and were furious at the amount of money she had accrued in fines. And I really thought she was going to stop being such an asshole, but I was wrong. Melon decided to blow off some of her final exams (genius!) and have a bunch of friends come over. They came over at 4AM and tried to have a <sq>quiet<sq> party. I woke up because I heard glass breaking on the floor and vodka began seeping under my door. I had an exam in the afternoon. I did NOT need this shit. Melon knocked on my door and I feigned sleep and when I heard her say <dq>don<sq>t worry, she<sq>s not home<dq> I called the RA and let the hammer fall. Her parents were called and they apologized to Orange and I and I<sq>m not sure what the final fine was.

If you<sq>re with a female friend / girlfriend things are a little different, as she<sq>ll probably feel more comfortable around another woman. <br><br>Also, don<sq>t make her feel embarrassed or patronised. For example, by saying to the harasser, <sq>look how terrified you<sq>re making her!<sq>. Don<sq>t speak for her, or draw attention to her vulnerability. When being harassed by a stranger in public, the last thing you want is even more eyes on you. Plus it<sq>s just embarrassing, and just drives home the point that she<sq>s unable to defend herself. <br><br>De-escalate the situation. Don<sq>t start a physical fight or something like that, 1. because violence is bad, 2. because she<sq>s gonna feel way responsible if someone gets hurt defending her, and 3. she<sq>s just gonna want things over as soon as possible. <br><br>So basically, the best thing to do is to draw attention away from her, without escalating the situation. </p>",

It isn<sq>t necessarily going to be applicable to you.<br><br>Always remember to respect his feelings. He feels that way for a reason and it should be honored. Don<sq>t tell him not to worry as this will cause cognitive dissonance, which will only serve to aggravate his stress. Instead, show that you care and that you trust him. Don<sq>t make him talk. It<sq>s not very well known amongst women, I think, that guys can get extremely emotional. We are raised to be seen and valued as caretakers, and feeling like you<sq>re a failure can cause you to feel worthless. There is no longer a way to be masculine, and so we cannot easily make ourselves feel better. You must, for now, show that you value him. No sex. Show affection. Sex is seen as a manly thing. He won<sq>t feel like a man, and your wanting sex and his not wanting it will make him feel worse because he won<sq>t seem very masculine. Do stuff you know he likes. Don<sq>t ask him if he<sq>d like to go; say that you<sq>re going to do it and would like him to go with you. Politely insist, if you must. Make sure it isn<sq>t something that<sq>s too public. A walk in a quiet neighborhood, perhaps. If you ask him to go, he<sq>ll say no, but if you show that you want him and say that you want to be around him, he<sq>ll be more likely to go with you. Don<sq>t say much, if anything. Just give him a hug and lead him. Seriously, take his hand and walk somewhere. He should be beside you, not behind. Don<sq>t look at him, just walk by his side and comfort him by holding him close and leaning your head on his shoulder. He might start talking. If so, keep doing what you<sq>re doing. No eye contact. Just listen. If he asks a yes or no question, simply hold him tighter or motion your answer with your head. Don<sq>t ask questions to try and understand him better; just listen. Once he airs his thoughts and feelings, head towards bench that<sq>s somewhere near home. Sit and listen some more. Once he airs his thoughts (if he does), take him home. You can cook a meal if you want, watch a movie he enjoys, cuddle perhaps. What he really needs now is time to reflect on what you<sq>ve done. The point of not talking was to not distract him from his feelings. A distraction would be aggravating as it would make him feel like his problem isn<sq>t important enough to be cared about, which would be even more demeaning to him. A time where he can be around you, but still not have to talk. You must not coax him into speaking. Most men need to process things on their own. That fact that he hid away from you shows that he is most likely one of those men. But the whole point of this is to show that you care for him, and thus, he is valuable.</p>",

If you<sq>re like most redditors in this thread, and are a fifteen year old virgin, then yes, I<sq>m sure the idea of sex will be great.  If you have grown-up problems, sex won<sq>t mean a fucking thing, and can make things worse if he gets performance anxiety from the stress, or distracted from the stress, and isn<sq>t up to snuff.  Ding ding ding, he just added another stressor to the list.<br><br>Give him space but be near him.  Most guys get over stress by contemplation and it<sq>s helpful knowing they at least have someone to talk to *if they want to talk.*  I wouldn<sq>t force him to think about it, either.  No forced walks on the beach or <dq>lets go somewhere you can think.<dq>  If you want him to loosen up, take him out to see a good funny movie, or even better, set up a movie date at home, so that you two can be close and it doesn<sq>t matter if he doesn<sq>t pay attention to the movie.  Ideally, you want to get him to do something to take his mind off of his stressors while still allowing him to think of them and not interrupt whatever he<sq>s doing.  <br><br>The goal is to get him to relax and let him think on his own terms.  People stress over things that they generally have no control over, and the only way to get past it is to realize that they have to grin and bear it and just power through it.  Don<sq>t assume he<sq>s in a bad mood because he<sq>s stressed - if you get upset with him, it will only exacerbate things.  He needs an ally that he can call on if and when he decides to.  <br><br>Let him do his thing, and you do yours.

We had an outdoor wedding at a historic home in our area that is rented for events. We had a friend marry us in a secular ceremony. It was short, and we had friends and family read (pre-written by them and approved by us) advice to us as part of it, and we recited both semi-traditional vows and vows that we wrote ourselves.

We had food stations with tacos, burgers, and BBQ instead of a <dq>traditional<dq> meal.<br><br>I was expecting some major pushback from older family members but got surprisingly little! Only my grandmother, once she found out about the food stations, kept commenting that she hoped that she would be able to find something to eat (for MONTHS before the wedding).

I<sq>m not sure of the source but I got it from Reddit <colon>)<br><br><dq><sq>The second time you fall in love with someone, you\u2019re going to feel so relieved. When you get your heart broken for the first time, you can\u2019t imagine loving someone else again or having someone else love you. You worry about your ex finding love before you do, you worry about being damaged goods. And then it happens. Someone else loves you and you can sleep well at night.<br><br>The second time you fall in love with someone, it\u2019s going to feel different. The first time felt like a dream almost. You were untouched, untainted by anyone. You accepted love with wide open arms and desperation. \u201cLove me, love me, love me!\u201d So you did. And then it fell apart and left you shocked to the core. You realized that people could be cruel and break your heart. You realized that people could stop meaning the sweet things they said to you just yesterday. So when you go into it again, you\u2019re going to keep in mind everything that you\u2019ve learned. You\u2019re going to say, \u201cLove me, love me, love me\u2026until you don\u2019t. In which case, I would like some advance warning. Thanks!\u201d<br><br>The second time you fall in love with someone, you\u2019re going to compare it to your first love. That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s natural. You\u2019re going to be studying the new love with judgement and wariness. \u201cMy ex never liked broccoli. Why the hell does this one eat so much broccoli?!\u201d Discovering that you have the ability to love multiple people who are different and feel different is initially very jarring. Loving an unfamiliar body will leave you disoriented and in dire need of a map. That\u2019s okay too. That\u2019s to be expected. Just ask the new love for directions.<br><br>The second time you fall in love with someone, you\u2019re going to suffer from a bout of amnesia. You\u2019re going to poke and prod at your lover\u2019s body and be like, \u201cWait, how do I do this again? How do I love you? I think it starts with us having a moment together in some coffee shop, right?\u201d It\u2019s going to feel scary at first. Falling in love is sort of like riding a bike though. You never really forget.<br><br>The second time you fall in love with someone, you\u2019ll be a more sane person. Your first love is when you get all of your insanity out. You behave like an insane monster because your mind is freaking out about all these new powerful feelings. By the second time, however, you have an idea of what works and what doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s by no means perfect. The insanity will make a cameo at some point. \u201cPeek a boo. I\u2019m here! Hope you didn\u2019t forget about me!\u201d But you can usually shoo it away after awhile.<br><br>The second time you fall in love with someone, you will hopefully have better sex. Do not quote me on this.<br><br>The second time you fall in love with someone will still be exciting and you might even talk about moving in together or marriage. It will feel more \u201cadult.\u201d You have no idea what adult love actually is but you think it involves making coffee for each other in the morning and maybe even getting a dog. \u201cThis is my dog, Xan. I got him with the second person I fell in love with because that\u2019s what you do! The first person I was in love with would\u2019ve killed a dog.\u201d<br><br>The second time will not be the first time. The first time is an insane magical life gift that you can never reclaim. But that\u2019s okay. The second time is more real anyway. The second time can involve some amazing love.<sq><dq></p>",

If she doesn<sq>t have a baby carrier I<sq>d suggest buying one for her, it<sq>s something a lot of people think they will be fine without but they regret not buying one. You can never get enough baby wipes or nappies. <br><br>In the first few weeks I pretty much just wanted to be left alone to do my thing with the baby and to eat and sleep and to not have to worry about anything else.

Aren<sq>t really digging your job? Look for a new one! Always wanted to live in a certain part of the country? Move there! Bought a house but decided you<sq>re not a house person? Sell it! You can always move back, you can always buy another house later if condo life loses its appeal, you can always educate yourself on whatever you want, you can always try something new. Your whole life is for trying things! Try all the things. Some won<sq>t work out. That isn<sq>t the same as failure.

Check out /r/curlyhair OR try to find the book [Curly Girl](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Curly-Girl-Handbook-Michele-Bender/dp/076115678X) it<sq>s short and simple to read and explains everything. <br><br>As a rundown of the basics - <br><br>* MOISTURIZE. My conditioner to shampoo ratio is like 10<colon>1. You may want to consider using less shampoo or even dropping sulfates altogether. <br><br>* Don<sq>t try to detangle or comb her hair dry - only when it<sq>s wet and slick with consitioner. Don<sq>t brush it, only comb (I recommend the tangle teezer). <br><br>* Use gel/curl cream, naked hair will often become really dry and frizzy, which makes it look like a giant poofba but more importantly causes tangles and giant mats. <br><br>* Since she<sq>s lttle and gonna be running around most of the time, I<sq>d suggest you keep her hair in protective styles - which can be as simple as just keeping it braided. If you can you and your stepbrother should learn to french braid (lots of tutorials on YouTube) - you can put her hair in two french braids and essentially not have to touch it for a couple days at all, and it won<sq>t have a chance to tangle much. <br><br>Good luck, it<sq>s really nice of you to be so concerned. The only other thing I would say is - do the research, **but pass it on to your brother.** Don<sq>t feel the need to take over because he<sq>s a guy and hair is a girl thing - plenty of black fathers are now stepping up their game and learning to take care of their daughters hair, he can do the same! </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Oooo awesome. Well black people<sq>s hair takes alot of hair care.  <br>  <br>So here are some general tips. It would take me forever to write down what I know, but I would suggest hairlista.com or bglhonline.com (which seperates hair by curl size), for more haircare techniques.  <br>  <br>1. Anyway, yes, shampoo is very important. You can<sq>t just buy any ordinary shampoo at the store and expect it to work. You need to buy conditioning shampoo, the ones without the harsh chemicals. Alot of people buy Shea Moisture Retention shampoos because it allows you to wash the hair without completely stripping all the moisture and nutrients unlike normal shampoos. Also, since our hair is usually very coily and curly, the oil that our scalp produces does not travel to the end of the hair shaft, which is why our hair tends to be dry. This is one of the reasons, black hair cannot and should not be washed every day. That will destroy her hair as her hair cannot deal with the constant manipulation and stripping of the much needed nutrients. Depending on how her hair is, your niece may have to wash your hair either once or twice a week, or once or twice a month.<br>  <br>2. You need conditioner. Again moisturizing conditioner. There<sq>s alot of different ones people use. Kinky Curly. Shea Moisture. Mixed Chicks. The list goes on and on and more products can be found on the previous websites I listed. Deep conditioner is also recommended as well. Make sure you leave the conditioner on for a considerable amount of time to replenish the moisture.   <br>  <br>3. You need to buy hair moisturizer for your girls hair. Moisturizer is basically a hair cream/lotion that moisturizes the hair. It<sq>s a must. This is what makes curly hair easier to work with as it lathers it with moisture. Look for water-based moisturizers. Basically, moisturizers whose first and primary ingredient lists aqua (water). Also, products with glycerin work very well.  <br>  <br>4. Lastly, you need a oil-based moisturizer or just an oil as well as an ending coat after you apply the water based moisturizer. You can get extra virgin olive oil, tea tree oil, rosemary oil, any oil. It serves to help retain the moisture in the hair.  <br>  <br>This is just a quick summary of basic hair care techniques. Go on those websites I mentioned and watch youtube clips. They<sq>re super helpful. <br><br>Good luck!</p>",

I spent a year out of the school system living in the back of a van as we drove from country to country. <br><br>- During this period, my parents would send me to the markets to say cute things in the local languages for free food. We<sq>d also raid fields for food (I mostly remember doing it with tomatoes in France).<br><br>- My parents didn<sq>t have <sq>real<sq> jobs; they made money through renovating and flipping houses and dealing antiques. For most of my childhood, literally nothing in any of our houses except for electronics were made after 1950.<br><br>- This included most of my own entertainment<colon> I was reading books and playing with toys from the 1800s and early 1900s.<br><br>- As a result, I assumed everyone used/had oil lamps, cast iron stoves, washboards, snuff boxes, etc. I also had some pretty dated vocabulary, due to the aforementioned books. Did you know the word <sq>ejaculated<sq> was used pretty frequently in 19th century literature for sudden/loud statements? Yeah.<br><br>* Consequently, a rumour went around that I was a ghost in not one, but two of the schools I was sent to.<br><br>* Looking back, the fact that my hands were always bleeding from copious hand washing might have also lent credence to the ghost rumours (three cheers for severe childhood OCD! except three is a bad number, and my pets will die if we cheer three times, so let<sq>s make it four). <br><br>* I have three half-siblings from both my mother and father. I was raised an only child. I<sq>ve met my half-sister less than a handful of times, one of my half-brothers maybe a dozen times, and I don<sq>t even know the name of my other half-brother. It makes answering the question, <dq>Do you have any sisters or brothers?<dq> tricky. <dq>No, but maybe two or three.<dq><br><br>* It was hard to make friends because no one wanted to come over to my house. Looking back, it might have been the 19th century coffin that was the centrepiece of the lounge room that deterred them. <br><br>* My houses were permanently under construction. It was pretty normal for me to have to shuffle/crawl across a beam suspended over a steep drop to get to the kitchen/bathroom/what-have-you because dad had removed the wooden floorboards in a lifted house.<br><br>* Despite being desperately poor for most of my childhood, my 10th birthday present was a Shetland pony with a giant pink bow wrapped around its torso??<br><br><br></p>",

This is one of her most beautiful letters.<br><br>Dear Sugar,<br><br>I read your column religiously. I\u2019m 22. From what I can tell by your writing, you\u2019re in your early 40s. My question is short and sweet<colon> what would you tell your 20-something self if you could talk to her now?<br><br>Love,<br>Seeking Wisdom<br><br><br>Dear Seeking Wisdom,<br><br>Stop worrying about whether you\u2019re fat. You\u2019re not fat. Or rather, you\u2019re sometimes a little bit fat, but who gives a shit? There is nothing more boring and fruitless than a woman lamenting the fact that her stomach is round. Feed yourself. Literally. The sort of people worthy of your love will love you more for this, sweet pea.<br><br>In the middle of the night in the middle of your twenties when your best woman friend crawls naked into your bed, straddles you, and says, You should run away from me before I devour you, believe her.<br><br>You are not a terrible person for wanting to break up with someone you love. You don\u2019t need a reason to leave. Wanting to leave is enough. Leaving doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re incapable of real love or that you\u2019ll never love anyone else again. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re morally bankrupt or psychologically demented or a nymphomaniac. It means you wish to change the terms of one particular relationship. That\u2019s all. Be brave enough to break your own heart.<br><br>When that really sweet but fucked up gay couple invites you over to their cool apartment to do ecstasy with them, say no.<br><br>There are some things you can\u2019t understand yet. Your life will be a great and continuous unfolding. It\u2019s good you\u2019ve worked hard to resolve childhood issues while in your twenties, but understand that what you resolve will need to be resolved again. And again. You will come to know things that can only be known with the wisdom of age and the grace of years. Most of those things will have to do with forgiveness.<br><br>One evening you will be rolling around on the wooden floor of your apartment with a man who will tell you he doesn\u2019t have a condom. You will smile in this spunky way that you think is hot and tell him to fuck you anyway. This will be a mistake for which you alone will pay.<br><br>Don\u2019t lament so much about how your career is going to turn out. You don\u2019t have a career. You have a life. Do the work. Keep the faith. Be true blue. You are a writer because you write. Keep writing and quit your bitching. Your book has a birthday. You don\u2019t know what it is yet.<br><br>You cannot convince people to love you. This is an absolute rule. No one will ever give you love because you want him or her to give it. Real love moves freely in both directions. Don\u2019t waste your time on anything else.<br><br>Most things will be okay eventually, but not everything will be. Sometimes you\u2019ll put up a good fight and lose. Sometimes you\u2019ll hold on really hard and realize there is no choice but to let go. Acceptance is a small, quiet room.<br><br>One hot afternoon during the era in which you\u2019ve gotten yourself ridiculously tangled up with heroin you will be riding the bus and thinking what a worthless piece of crap you are when a little girl will get on the bus holding the strings of two purple balloons. She\u2019ll offer you one of the balloons, but you won\u2019t take it because you believe you no longer have a right to such tiny beautiful things. You\u2019re wrong. You do.<br><br>Your assumptions about the lives of others are in direct relation to your na\u00efve pomposity. Many people you believe to be rich are not rich. Many people you think have it easy worked hard for what they got. Many people who seem to be gliding right along have suffered and are suffering. Many people who appear to you to be old and stupidly saddled down with kids and cars and houses were once every bit as hip and pompous as you.<br><br>When you meet a man in the doorway of a Mexican restaurant who later kisses you while explaining that this kiss doesn\u2019t \u201cmean anything\u201d because, much as he likes you, he is not interested in having a relationship with you or anyone right now, just laugh and kiss him back. Your daughter will have his sense of humor. Your son will have his eyes.<br><br>The useless days will add up to something. The shitty waitressing jobs. The hours writing in your journal. The long meandering walks. The hours reading poetry and story collections and novels and dead people\u2019s diaries and wondering about sex and God and whether you should shave under your arms or not. These things are your becoming.<br><br>One Christmas at the very beginning of your twenties when your mother gives you a warm coat that she saved for months to buy, don\u2019t look at her skeptically after she tells you she thought the coat was perfect for you. Don\u2019t hold it up and say it\u2019s longer than you like your coats to be and too puffy and possibly even too warm. Your mother will be dead by spring. That coat will be the last gift she gave you. You will regret the small thing you didn\u2019t say for the rest of your life.<br><br>Say thank you.<br><br>http<colon>//therumpus.net/2011/02/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-64/</p>",

I was in bed watching Netflix and he walked in with flowers, gummy bears, and chocolate. I prefer Black Forest gummies, and he showed me the bag of them and said <dq>I<sq>m not sure if I got your favorite brand? Also I got you hazelnut chocolate because I thought you<sq>d like that.<dq> I always ask for hazelnut flavor in my coffee, so the fact that he remembered I had a favorite brand of gummy bears and noticed I love hazelnut, on top of feeling sick and pre-period hormonal, I started bawling telling him how sweet he is.

I went through cycles of being totally bored, creeped out, and scared that they were going to forget about me. <br><br>I surrendered myself and they took me and all the other people into a room and lined us up for mug shots.  They put me in a holding cell with like 10 other girls. We entertained ourselves by playing Never Have I Ever and counting bricks in the wall. We<sq>d form a human wall whenever someone had to pee so that they wouldn<sq>t be embarrassed to go in front of everyone. <br><br>The guards were absurdly rude, talking shit to us the entire time.  It felt unnecessary but whatever. <br><br>With the timing of my surrender, I ended up being the only girl to be transported with about 20 other guys throughout the night. The guards did really well with keeping me separated.  The scariest part of the night was being put in the back of a van with three cages. I was in one cage while a bunch of male inmates were in the other two.  One guy stared me down the entire time, grunting and saying disgusting things to me.  I closed my eyes and ignored him. <br><br>I didn<sq>t get to the tents until about 3am.  They gave me a pat down while guys whistled and yelled in the distance. None of my bunk mates were scary, just other women like me who made a mistake. It was so hot and the bed was uncomfortable.  I think I got maybe one hour of sleep. Guys kept sticking their dicks through the fence and yelling to get our attention. <br><br>A guard called my name around 8am and had me walk back to the jail with a group of guys. One guy asked me how my night was, then a guard turned around and said something like, <dq>how romantic! You can tell your kids you met in jail!<dq> We didn<sq>t talk anymore after that. <br><br>They put me in a holding cell for 6 hours while they did my exit paperwork or whatever it was they had to do, then let me go.  My mom was waiting in the parking lot with a sandwich and a gallon of ice cold water. Tent city in June is no joke, I was severely dehydrated. <br><br>And it<sq>s true, everything there is pink.

What if birth control destroys my libido so much I can barely stomach having sex, or it changes our relationship when I get off of it? What if your childfree spouse changes her mind at 33 or 29 or 40, would you adopt/ split/ have a kid? How will marriage change the relationship? What if your atheist fiancee finds Jesus or Zeus at a carnival and wants to go to church? How will you handle hosting parties if your guests differ from you (they have rowdy kids, or are staunch vegan, or drink too much, etc - basically an incompatibility that can make hanging out with people strained)? What if I meet your high school best friends and I don<sq>t like them and/ or they<sq>re bad news? Who will check the mail and do you mind if s/he opens yours for you? What would you do if I got too drunk at an important party? What are YOUR PERSONAL reasons that you<sq>d divorce; how big of a lie would it take to walk away completely from either side? How will you handle crushes and how far is too far with another person? What are your vices and how will you handle them getting out of control? <br><br>Basically, I think that the day-to-day stuff like chores are easily solved with compatibility and communication. I think the stuff that needs to be talked about is the uncomfortable, cynical stuff that no one likes discussing.

Though this pair did mention they are planning a laid back party soon to celebrate, maybe like a simple BBQ in the park?<br><br>The others just carried on and didn<sq>t really mark the occasion beyond a city hall ceremony & intimate lunch with a few people. However all these couples had been a couple and/or living together already for almost 10+ years or needed to get married last minute for visa purposes.<br><br>Of my female friends who went the traditional wedding extravaganza route, (some had 100+ guests), 95<percent> of them regretted that decision half way though the planning, even when they had hired a wedding planner! At that point they wanted to elope, but family and SOs raised hell about it, so it was like they were already in too deep. (Save the date cards already mailed).  In these cases, they only knew their SOs for less than three to five years. <br><br>One set tried to cut down the numbers, guests and stress by having an all inclusive package destination wedding. They still ended up with about 50 (kinda-pissed-off-we-had-to-waste-precious-vacation-time-and-tons-of-money-to-attend-only-for-you-to divorced-6-months-later) guests. The bride still managed to turn into a totally insufferable bride-zilla despite the fact that they chose a set package where all they had to do was show up. I would not recommend. Still stressful, not to mention having to accommodate frail relatives, guests with kids or guests with tough work schedules and any other number of complaints and requests.<br><br>The other 5<percent> who weren<sq>t too *relatively* stressed had the whole extravaganza due to family pressure and did not really care, though there were some mighty groom-zillas in these cases.  They pretty much said yes to whatever options the mom and/or m-i-l planned or wanted, since they were paying, and she only worried about her dress, hair/makeup, & photographer (which she paid for). Still some degree of stress though and it was a huge, expensive 6 month + time suck despite the fact that the m-i-ls and moms planned most of it. <br><br>What was my point? Oh yeah, unless the couple had been together for soooo long that they were pretty much common law married in the eyes of their respective families or had mitigating circumstances (e.g. visa), the respective families placed HUGE pressure on the couples to have a big wedding. It wasn<sq>t the couple<sq>s wedding anymore, it was the respective mothers<sq>/parents<sq> wish fulfillment weddings.<br><br>**TLDR**<colon> I think your biggest hurdle won<sq>t be your future wife, but your families. Unless you guys re together for so long that the ceremony becomes a mere formality, have a mitigating circumstances (e.g. visa) or are a far older couple than the norm (think 50+), expect to get a sh** ton of pressure and guilt about it from the families. Your future wife may very well be your side, but it becomes hard sometimes to turn down family and societal expectations. Sure there is no force field stopping you from eloping, or going super private like you described, but you<sq>ll have to do it knowing you are likely pissing off and disappointing a LOT of people; extended family, friends and colleagues feeling hurt & dissed that they were left out and not being at all shy to say it or show it. Bridges have been burned over this issue. All in all, the brides at the end of the party each commented that they learned the wedding isn<sq>t for the them, the couple.<br></p>",

Sometimes, instead of having that conversation about <dq>you feel zonked and want to be by yourself, and I feel lonely and want to hang out with you how should we handle this<dq>, they just find themselves regularly in crisis mode, where they <dq>need<dq> the other person to help them, so their need trumps the other person<sq>s want.

For me personally the sacrifices don<sq>t outweigh the good parts but the cost of those sacrifices would weigh heavier on others. <br><br>I do have a lot of regrets<colon> loss of my freedom, not being welcome in certain places, I hate the noise, the financial cost of food/diapers/childcare/loss of earnings on maternity leave, the difficulty of travelling with a child or two, the effect on my body and the physical scars and ailments I now have as a result of pregnancy and two honestly pretty normal births, the lack of sleep, the constant obligation to be around someone I often don<sq>t like, the increase in housework that never ends, the repetition, movies that I<sq>d love to see when they come out but will not actually watch for many more years, losing touch with friends/not making friends with colleagues because I can<sq>t hang out as often after work when I have to go home and pickup my kid from childcare, the cost of babysitting, being judged for saying No to my kid, being judged for saying Yes to my kid, never being good enough at anything, never having a sick day to lie in bed, not drinking because I can<sq>t do hangovers any more so losing still more of the person I used to be, not spending enough quality time with my husband - I miss him, we are always talking about chores and schedules and arrangements rather than plans and opinions and sharing new things we have learned. And sex is different and less frequent though we are still into each other as much as ever. <br><br>These things are all small regrets I have about having children. But they don<sq>t hurt me as much as they might hurt another person.  I have already done lots of travel, finished my education, spent ten years with my partner before having children, found a job that works well with my childcare responsibilities and which I really enjoy, and am financially stable. My very best friends have children of a similar age too, so my social life hasn<sq>t completely died. If I had had to give up my education, my dream job, move away from my home, work in a dead end job just to try and keep everything going, not been able to afford the home I wanted, or been kicked out of home by parents or partner for getting pregnant, had never travelled - I think I would find the regrets a lot more consuming than I do.  </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I didn<sq>t have my first O till 28. Nothing was working. No finger, tongue or toy could wake the beast. Finally last year my room mate was out and I had the place to myself for the night. I decided to try something new. I<sq>d noticed the few times I<sq>d smoked weed I<sq>d gotten some tingles down there before passing the fuck out. So this round I decided to make the effort to stay awake and see where it goes. I seduced the shit out of myself. I lit all my candles, burned some incense, turned on my string lights and cranked my new favorite band at the time (kings of leon) then hopped in the bath tub with a glass of wine, dark chocolate and an edible. Soaked and chilled for about half an hour before I started feeling giggly and the body tingles...go time. I dried off, slipped into my silky nighty and crawled in bed. My arsenal was already set out on my nightstand. My comically large dildo, my rabbit vibe and my lube. Started with a little lube on my two fingers and started flicking the bean.....it was meh. <dq>Oh great<dq> I think. <dq>My last idea and it<sq>s a dud. I guess I *am* broken<dq> but then I stopped trying to play it like a DJ and put a finger on each side of my clit and moved up and down instead of left to right. Wow. Id never had sensation bellow the belt before. I<sq>m talking 0 ladies. This was a revelation. I wasn<sq>t broken! I had hope. I actually cried a little. It felt fucking GREAT but I still couldn<sq>t quite reach that edge, so I moved onto my silly huge purple dildo given to me as a gag gift. I started with one hard deep thrust and my whole body reacted. After a few seconds of trying to go slow I gave in and just started hammering the ever loving fuck out of myself. <dq>Is this what sex is *supposed* to feel like!? Oh my god, I felt like I<sq>d discovered America. Yet still I wasn<sq>t getting all the way there and both my shoulders were tiring out. Alright, gloves off. Out comes the rabbit. I pump away a few more times then flip the switch. Sweet. Jesus. H. CHRIST!!!! WHAT!? I stopped breathing, I clenched my abs and my ass and curled up like a dead roly polie. I felt myself rushing towards the edge, cresting it and then exploding over it. As <dq>Closer<dq> blared from my speakers my body was paralyzed with titanic waves of the most insane pleasure I<sq>ve ever known in my entire life, radiating out from my clit, racing through my body and crashing into my brain. About 5-6 waves total. Every muscle gave out at once, I flop to the bed covered in sweat I didn<sq>t realize had formed and gasped for breath I didn<sq>t realize I hadn<sq>t been taking. I promptly blacked out with a smile on my face and my vibrator still inside me. Now when that song pops on my Pandora I get super turned on and can<sq>t stop smiling.   </p>",

Let<sq>s call her Susie. She and his other female roommate (let<sq>s call her Tina) were in the same sorority together and knew each other well. <br><br>One night the sorority decides to throw a huge social, which Tina can<sq>t attend but Susie will. Susie didn<sq>t own many nice dresses on account of her not having a job, so she asked Tina if she could borrow one. Tina pulls out a couple of dresses she<sq>d be willing to let Susie borrow, but Susie goes into her closet and pulls out a really pretty dress, asking Tina if she could wear it. Tina says no since it was really expensive and means a lot to her and would be really upset if Susie were to ruin it somehow. So Susie picks out a different dress and everything is hunky dory. <br><br>The night of the social, Susie goes into Tina<sq>s room to grab the dress she settled on. Tina was asleep at this point, so Susie decided to take the other dress instead. Susie<sq>s gets to the party, where her boyfriend sees her and tells her to change since he thought she looked too slutty. So she goes to her friends room and changes into a friend<sq>s dress and ditches Tina<sq>s dress in the room. During the party, someone else goes into the room, finds the dress, and texts Tina saying she found it and keeps it to return to her the next day. After the party Susie goes back to the room to try to find the dress and panics that it<sq>s gone. <br><br>So Tina now has the dress, and knows what Susie did, even though Susie hasn<sq>t said a word about it to Tina, not even to apologize for losing her dress. I think Tina<sq>s saving that hand of cards for the perfect moment to play it. <br><br>Sorry that was super long and kind of stupid but as a chick, I<sq>d be super pissed if someone stole my clothing and lost it and then didn<sq>t at least fess up like a decent human being. <br><br>Edit<colon> I<sq>ve texted him to see if anything has happened since then.

I<sq>m so sorry guys. <br><br>Tina<sq>s best friend Kristie (also in the same sorority) ended up hashing it out on Tina<sq>s behalf (not sure what was said or why she did it in the first place). Basically everyone in the sorority and their friend group knew what happened and they all were angry at Susie. Tina and Kristie ended up taking all of Susie<sq>s sorority shirts and returned them to the sorority as punishment. Susie<sq>s boyfriend (who is my friend and Tina<sq>s roomie) ended up breaking up with her and Susie left the sorority. I<sq>m not sure how much of that last sentence was due to the dress incident but Susie is never around anymore and I think everything is a lot less tense. <br><br>But now Tina has become the psycho roomie in the house.

I ended up in a four bedroom with three girls that the apartment complex matched up with me.  I hated living there.  <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><br>At first the other girls were just the typically annoying roommate.  I started labeling my food, because they were eating everything I brought in.  I typically had to take my laundry home because they were constantly leaving things in the wash.  There was one afternoon that I was on my way to class and noticed it was left open with nothing in it, so I put my things in it and went to class since they left stuff all the time.  I came back to find all my clothes lying on the kitchen table still soaking wet. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I ordered something off Ebay once, and kept watching the tracking for it.  It claimed it was delivered, but my package wasn<sq>t anywhere to be found.  I got back online and looked into it, because this is back when places still had you sign for things, so I could actually see one of my roommates signatures for it.  When I asked she lied about it.  We argued forever about it, because she wouldn<sq>t admit that she took it.  Ironically, at the end of the year when my parents came to help move me out, the idiot was wearing the bracelet.  My mom actually removed it from her.  That was a pretty hilarious scene.  <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Things had started disappearing from my room, so I spoke with the front office and got them to install a deadbolt on my bedroom door.  When I moved out at the end of the year, I left just a few things with the intent that I would use the a couple times over summer to visit some friends.  One of the girls asked me to let her know if I was coming to visit since she would be alone there, and didn<sq>t want someone coming in to scare her.  Turns out she just wanted me to let her know because she was putting friends up in my room.  I came back to find stuff strewn about and vomit all over the room.  Remember that deadbolt?  Yeah, apparently I lived with Macgyver. One of the girls worked in the front office and stole a key long enough for them to take a plastic hairspray cap, cut a hole in two sides and rigged some string so that they could use it to unlock the door from the outside.  Lord I could rant all day about the idiots I lived with back then. </p>",

He was an angelic-looking 13-year-old kid with mild intellectual disabilities.  He had kind of a class clown personality and loved any kind of attention, especially from attractive, sympathetic female staff members who doted on him.  He was extremely good at presenting himself as a good, earnest child who was the victim of bullying and mean parents.  But he wasn<sq>t quite high-functioning enough to keep up the act *all* the time.  He<sq>d act out extremely violent fantasies with his toys, he<sq>d randomly attack people who irritated him, and he<sq>d threaten any woman who *didn<sq>t* fall for his sweet-little-boy act with rape or murder.  A lot of the kids at the hospital were violent, but they didn<sq>t really have the mental capacity to *plan* violence.  With this kid, it was all premeditated and there was often a sexual element.  He knew which staff members he hated, and he knew how to skirt the facility<sq>s rules.  We had to count his utensils after meals to make sure he didn<sq>t have anything that could be used as a weapon.  I heard from a coworker that he had a history of harming animals and sexually assaulting girls at his school.  Even his mother seemed to be afraid of him.  This was several years ago, so that kid is probably going to age out of the children<sq>s mental health care system soon...</p>",

                "answer": "<p>My father is a sociopath. I cut him out of my life about 5 years ago. <br><br>He was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder around age 19 by the US military and was discharged before boot camp ended. All I know about that is there was <dq>an incident<dq> in the barracks and he was held in the hospital facility for a few days, then he was sent home with a diagnosis and Entry Level Discharge papers. (He later told people he was discharged for breaking his foot during boot camp, but that story didn<sq>t emerge for at least 10 years.) <br><br>I<sq>ve also heard tales that as a young man, he would pick up prostitutes and kill them instead of paying. I<sq>ve heard this from him and from his high school classmates. <br><br>He had a very strong sense of justice and structure, they just didn<sq>t match with society<sq>s. He felt he was Justice Incarnate (he used those words) and would take it upon himself to punish others for things he felt were wrong. His <dq>punishment<dq> was always more extreme than the <dq>crime<dq>. For example, if someone parked too close to the line, he would put Superglue in their locks, which he saw as a 1<colon>1 exchange. <dq>They inconvenienced me, I<sq>m inconveniencing them.<dq> (He actually bought superglue singles in bulk and always carried it with him. He superglued car locks about once a week.) <br><br>My father got into computer programming as a way to stop people like himself (for dank profits) because he was a master hacker and cyber-stalker. One time, he felt someone at another table in the restaurant was rude to him in the lobby, so he convinced the waitress to tell him the name on the credit card receipt. He used that name to find out a ton of stuff about this guy (including address, phone number, employer, etc -- all pretty impressive considering it was 1998) and then he stalked the crap out of him. He sent this guy threatening messages, slashed his tires, called in fake complaints to his employer, called him from a burner phone at all hours... For like two years he terrorized this guy, until the guy moved to another state. <br><br>He was a terror to grow up around. He was extremely paranoid about the government and believed a lot of conspiracy theories because believing them enforced his belief that he was smarter than everyone else and could see patterns no one else could see. He called school <dq>the idiot factory<dq> and believed that formal education was just a way to control the masses. <br><br>Because of this, he <dq>homeschooled<dq> us kids. He also worked from home, so we were monitored 24/7 by him. (I put it in quotes because I think there probably is a real type of homeschooling out there, but we were not homeschooled. We were just kept at home and any studying we did was of things he wrote or printed off from the internet. When I was 11, he made me study The Anarchist<sq>s Bible. We never studied any accurate history or science.) <br><br>He ran our household like a 1950s nightmare. My mother was not permitted to work and she had to report to him literally every 10 minutes if they were apart. He tracked her for the entire day. At dinner time, she had to put dinner on the table and we all had to sit silently in our assigned seats until he arrived. When he came to the table, he would first read a written list of complaints he had about the world that day and describe any punishments he had enacted. This could take over an hour and only he was allowed to speak. Only then could we eat. During the meal, he would play <dq>Devil<sq>s Advocate<dq> by picking a topic, assigning someone to represent a side, and then haranguing them until they cried. No one would be dismissed from the dinner table until someone cried. This could take three or four hours as we got older and more resistant to his ways. <br><br>My father tried to avoid anyone knowing that kids were in the house. We didn<sq>t know any of our neighbors. Any windows facing other houses or the street had to be covered at all times. We weren<sq>t allowed outdoors even in our own backyard. To leave the house, we had to get in the car in the garage and then go (and only with him as a chaperone, or with my mom calling every 10 minutes to check in). The first time I went anywhere outside my house without my parents being within 5 feet of me, I was 17 years old and I ran away from home. <br><br>Despite all of that, most people thought he was the most charming person in the world. He had such absolute control over the family that people thought we were perfect. What they didn<sq>t know was that if we didn<sq>t act like perfectly pleasant (and silent) children, we would be harshly punished at home. Once hitting us no longer worked, he would beat the dog in front of us. <br><br>I have about a billion more stories if anyone is still curious about growing up with a sociopathic parent. </p>",

You<sq>re doing the right thing with double, my mom had a second, unrelated breast cancer on the second breast and lost that battle. Breast cancer is more aggressive in those under 40, and more likely to reoccur; being young is not an advantage with this cancer as people may think.  I<sq>m very glad doctors and insurance now agree on double mastectomies and reconstruction. On with what I know, just wanted to get a little knowledge out there first for people.<br><br><br>My mom suffered a lot more pain than those with regular implants. You<sq>re losing all your natural tissue, and getting scraped down to the bone. Her doctor used expanders to open the breast pocket for the implant, which was also painful. My mom didn<sq>t have a nipple, not sure why, I was in elementary school and didn<sq>t ask. Instead she had a long scar and sort of a flat breast where a partial implant existed. Not having any natural breast tissue to cover the implants, don<sq>t expect them to feel like your natural breast. You<sq>ll get used to the new feel, and on the plus side, they<sq>ll always be perky and firm! <br><br><br>Lands End sells mastectomy swimsuits and bras that have padding inserts to fill out the cup. These will be great if your reconstruction is done later or in stages. My mom couldn<sq>t afford to finish her surgery, it was called elective back then and not covered by insurance. So she had an A cup flat breast with normal B cup breast. These products really helped her. <br><br><br>You may also be having lymph nodes removed in your arm pit if the cancer is at all advanced. My mom could never fully extend her arms up again, or lift really heavy things. <br><br><br>You<sq>re doing a brave thing that your family, present and future, will be grateful for.

She went through 6 rounds of chemo, had a double mastectomy and had 33 rounds of radiation. After the surgery the expansions were pretty rough in her. I think she started with 100 cc of fluid at a time but had to drop to around 75 each time because it was to painful. After she got to the size she wanted, they are ROCK hard. Unfortunately for her she had to be deflated to do radiation. She finished that on Thursday and is now going to get them filled back up. She has to wait a calendar year before her plastic surgeon will do the implants now because of the radiation. She is not to to have the nipples put on. She is opting to have 3d ones tatooed. Have you done any research on the care you have to do after the surgery? The drain tubes you will have and having to strip and clean them? It wasn<sq>t bad for my wife but some women have a tough time with that also. Talk to your doctor about it and Google it. Are you married or have a long term relationship? I will gladly talk to him/her about what to expect on that side of the fence. All of this can be very overwhelming but you can get through it. If you need someone to talk to, my wife would be happy to. Send me a private message and I will give you her or my number.</p>",

It<sq>s been two years.<br><br>Warning<colon> potential wall of text! <br><br>I<sq>m torn about my decision not to get the double. On one hand, there really isn<sq>t a super high risk that the type of cancer I had would metastasize to the other breast. On the other hand, the single mastectomy was super fucking painful, and if I ever have to have another one I<sq>ll be mad that I didn<sq>t do it all at once. <br><br>That said, there are a few things I didn<sq>t expect. <br><br>First, everything sucks right after. Stuff you didn<sq>t think about. Hugs, seatbelts, getting dressed. They will all cause you extreme pain. <br><br>When the pain subsided (for me it was a few weeks), I started having muscle spasms from the tissue expanders. That process is pretty painful. They give you muscle relaxers (if the implants go under your pectorals) but it<sq>s pretty gruesome and your boobs will look super weird for a few months.  <br><br>And you<sq>re young, so people will cry at you. A lot. You will find yourself comforting other people even though *you<sq>re* the one dealing with it. <br><br>I recommend getting dry shampoo, baby wipes + a shower head that detaches and having someone help you wash your hair, because showering is a nightmare at first. After a couple of tries you<sq>ll figure it out, but the first shower wasn<sq>t fun. <br><br>The first time I tried to pee by myself after the surgery, I couldn<sq>t reach my arm down to wipe myself without searing, excruciating pain. It made my eyes water, but I did it. <br><br>And the drains are pretty uncomfortable, especially at the exit-part. It gets scabby after a few days and when your clothes rub it the wrong way your scabs will tear a little. <br><br>YMMV, but I bought some cute high-neckline shirts and infinity scarves. Also, slip-on boots will help immensely. The binder they have you wear is atrocious and clothes look weird over it. Plus your boobs will be misshappen/swollen for a while so I wanted something to cover up but still feel pretty. <br><br>Also, bending over to put on shoes will hurt, and the compression stockings are also ugly. Slip-on boots. Trust me.<br><br>As for nipples, I kept mine. I<sq>ve never heard of them falling off! Aah! I have no real sensation on my breasts or nipples anymore. It<sq>s like a weird phantom-feeling. <br><br>They look pretty natural and no one guesses that I have implants. I<sq>m 5<sq>6, about 125-130lbs and I have 34Ds. I didn<sq>t realize that D<sq>s aren<sq>t really *that* big. <br><br>Oh, and bras are weird now. I don<sq>t really like the sensation of underwire anymore so I wear wire-free or soft bras most of the time. Plus they<sq>re all perky now so I don<sq>t have to worry about lift & sag. <br><br>Edit<colon> one more thing. After a couple of years, cancer won<sq>t be all you think about anymore. One day you<sq>ll realize that it<sq>s been a few days since it crept into your mind. One day this will all be in your rearview.<br><br> <br><br>TL;DR<colon> there<sq>s a lot of stuff to consider that they don<sq>t tell you. It<sq>s gross, and sucky but it<sq>s going to be okay.

This guy messaged me and he mentioned nothing that was sexual, unlike most of the others. That was kind of my clue that he actually wanted to meet me as a person, for dating, and not just sleeping around. Long story short, we met up, saw each other 5-6 days a week for a year, moved in together then. At 2 years we got married. It<sq>s been 3.5 years now and he is amazing. Responsible, SANE, financially stable. He makes me a better person. When I was single my friends used to make fun of me because of how long I was single for, and told me I was gonna die an old maid.

I had no experience in hair, I came from a retail and administrative background. <br><br>The salon is in a mall and we used to be closed Sundays and Mondays, but the company that owned the chain suddenly decided to open us for a few hours on Sunday afternoons. Because it was so new, it was staffed only with junior (fresh out of hair school) stylists, and nobody had anything scheduled for the first few weekends, and had to rely on walk-ins from mall customers. <br><br>The second Sunday that we were open, we had 2 clients, a mom and daughter.  They waited out front on the couches in the mall hallway (rather than in our salon waiting area) and then came in when the stylists were ready. About 10 minutes later, both stylists came out to the front.  <br><br>Head lice!  On both of them.<br><br>Rather than buy the lice shampoo from a drug store, this lady thought it would be equally as effective to come into a salon for a quick wash and trim. <br><br>Everybody basically freaked out. I didn<sq>t know fuck all about lice other than it being something you can <dq>catch.<dq>  The junior stylists had never had experience with it either, and NONE of us had any training on how to handle the situation. I ended up turning away a couple of men<sq>s cuts while the team bleached the shit out of those stations, and called the mall office so they could clean the couches, except they roped off the whole corner and thus blocked off our shop entrance so potential customers couldn<sq>t even access the retail area.  <br><br>We couldn<sq>t get ahold of any of either of the store managers because it was a Sunday and we didn<sq>t have the Internet on the store computers (this was before iPhones) so we couldn<sq>t even look up what else we should do to make sure we were in the clear in terms of health & safety or making sure the next clients to come in wouldn<sq>t contract lice.  While I was misinformed in how contagious lice is, thought I was acting in the best interest in both our clientele and the salon<sq>s reputation.<br><br>I got fired the next day for closing the store early, even though we were cordoned off by the mall.</p>",

It starts at $55 and it<sq>s $15 for every extra 80g. So she gets her bleach blonde hair done for $70, instead of the hundreds of dollars it would cost elsewhere. I worked the front desk and Rhonda CRIED and SCREAMED at us that she never had to pay that before. Except this happened every time for half a year and we have extensive records of our guests including payment history, purchase history, color formulas, cut instructions, and even personality notes. <br><br>Carmen came in every two weeks for her retouch. Most of our frequent guest we charge only product, but not her. She was such a negative human being! She was also a perfectionist. For the longest she insisted we add Splenda to the haircolor to keep it from irritating her scalp. Some color lines it works with, but it isn<sq>t necessary with ours. So we stopped doing it and unsurprisingly her scalp had no issues with the color. She also brought in her own paint brush to use instead of an actual color brush. And top of everything else she insisted upon blow drying her own hair. I never had her as a guest but I would have flipped my shit if she tried to touch anything of mine. I went through two hair dryers during beauty school as it was, I don<sq>t need a guest breaking it! She ended up getting banned for a waxing incident where she was verbally abusive to the student. <br><br>Trisha is an old woman who likes to wear pants with rhinestones on them. She isn<sq>t terrible but she is very particular about which instructor is stationed with her chosen student. Well we<sq>ve started a new thing to track instructor productivity so students have to stay in their designated bank of stations with that one designated instructor, and can<sq>t go off and find a different instructor. Any who Trisha was PISSED when we started enforcing this. My manager sweetly smiled and said if she wants that instructor so badly she can get a service with her wherever she works in salon and pay those prices, instead of $35 for all over color. <br><br>Kim is a methhead who has been banned from services but still has gift cards so she is allowed to still purchase product. She has admitted in the past she gets the gift cards from drug sales or prostitution. She used her processing time to sell drugs over the phone. One time she came in and had $20 left on her card. She was about to buy some conditioner but wandered off to the makeup. Now she was so loud and kind of erratic so I just rang up her purchase and handed her the bag before she was even done shopping. I just wanted to get her out of there!!! She had open sores on her face and swore so much! <br><br>Laura got banned because she is a racist and was verbally abusive to students and staff. She also liked to have a few too many beers before she showed up. She looked like a dark haired Michelle Dugger. Now a newbie accidentally booked an appointment for her after she had been banned so we honored that last appointment, except she called to say she was running late and when the receptionist told her we wouldn<sq>t have time for both color and cut if she ran late, she called her a fat donkey and all sorts of other names, and made her cry. Laura got extra banned. <br><br>Alexa likes to decline the disposable panties for spa services and walk around with her robe open. She<sq>s beautiful but seriously put it away! She also tries to use multiple $5 off coupons at once. Alexa your manicure is already only $8! Get a grip! <br><br>Edit<colon> i really appreciated all the kind words! I used to be a creative writing major before I switched to becoming a hairstylist. I hope I can combine the two someday! </p>",

I took her back to my treatment room, and her alone for a minute to get undressed. When I came back in the room, I noticed a pair of scissors had been taken out of one of my drawers and left on the counter (a drawer that was CLEARLY NOT MEANT for client use). They were office scissors, not meant for cutting hair and definitely not sanitized. When I went to lay down a strip of wax on the woman<sq>s lady-bits, I notice she<sq>s bleeding profusely. I asked her about it, and she said that she took the scissors out of the drawer to trim her hair for me. She had pulled the hair away from her body to cut it, but instead of cutting the pubes she accidentally CUT OFF THE ENTIRE CHUNK OF SKIN. Needless to say I let her know she wouldn<sq>t be getting waxed, and she left. I never heard from her again. </p>",

He was a military guy and a scientist, and his life experiences led him more and more to believe that there was a right way to do everything, and one just had to do the research, find out what that one way was, and do it -- and that the right answer was the same for everyone.  I, on the other hand, was a grad student in the social sciences, and had friends with a wide range of lifestyles; I became more and more convinced that there were many different ways to do things, and that one needed to experiment, to figure out what worked for you as an individual, to negotiate with those around you, and to craft a unique path through life.  Those two opinions and approaches toward life didn<sq>t work so well together.  <br><br>Over time, he got more and more critical and controlling, and while I<sq>m pretty easy-going, it resulted in first my depression and then fights as I tried to push back.

We couldn<sq>t even agree on music to listen to in the car - I hated his music, he hated mine. I liked to go to clubs and go dancing, he wanted to go to heavy metal shows. I wanted to meet his friends and family, he didn<sq>t want me involved with them. <br><br>But we clung to each other in a really co-dependent fashion for many, many years. The sex stopped 2 years into the almost 10 year relationship. Got married at year 7-8ish because he needed health insurance, and I was even bitter about how all of that went down. The past 2 years, it got worse... I picked up multiple jobs to send him to college. He wasn<sq>t working for most of the relationship. He GPS tracked my phone to a restaurant I told him I was going to with girls from work one night and sat outside the restaurant and called inside the hostess to make sure I was in there. We had a mutual married couple friends - the wife of that couple and I went to dinner. He texted her while we were at dinner to make sure I was actually there with her.... The final straw was when he locked in a room for several hours because I locked the bathroom door when I was in the shower. He was mad at me for locking the bathroom door while I was in there --- so he locked in me in the bedroom until I could break the lock off the door and get out. <br><br>I was terrified, and spooked and should have called the police. I didn<sq>t want to get him in trouble, I just wanted out so I didn<sq>t. It wasn<sq>t healthy. We weren<sq>t helping each other grow, we were stunting each other. So, about 2 weeks after he locked me in the room, I grew the balls to tell him I wanted to move out.<br><br> I don<sq>t know how he is doing - he is taking me to court for spousal support instead of signing the agreement that he initially agreed to that was sent to him.... <br><br>My bills are so high, I will likely have to file for bankruptcy and leave my job, walk out on my lease and my whole life to move somewhere cheaper. I cannot afford to give him 50<percent> of my income -- I just don<sq>t have that kind of money to keep myself afloat... I<sq>m terrified. <br><br>That being said - ending the relationship is something that should have been done many years ago, I regret signing the marriage license deeply and feel like I cheated myself out of something real to accommodate something unhealthy. <br><br>I am much happier now - I have friends again, I go out and enjoy life. I go to concerts, I date people... I sleep better, I feel like myself again and I haven<sq>t felt this great in many, many years. </p>",

What most men don<sq>t understand that sex, especially casual sex, is high-risk, low-reward for women and low-risk, high-reward for men. <br><br>For women<colon><br><br>* You have a greater risk of STDs. <br><br>* You can get pregnant, and if you do, you will have to deal with it in some way 100<percent> of the time. <br><br>* You will most likely not orgasm. There is also a decent chance that you will not feel any pleasure from the hookup at all, or even pain and discomfort. <br><br>* Your safety is much much more at risk. Women are over 80<percent> of sex-related homicide victims and much more likely to be raped by the opposite gender than men are. Women also have little to no chance at self defense without a weapon.<br><br>* Your reputation is much more at risk. <br><br>For men<colon><br><br>* You have a much lower risk for STDs than women do. <br><br>* You will not get pregnant, and even if your partner does, there is a huge chance you will not have to deal with it at all (via abortion, adoption, or just being a deadbeat dad). <br><br>* You will nearly always orgasm. If you don<sq>t, you will always receive some pleasure from the act. <br><br>* Your safety is hardly at risk at all.

With society as it is right now, it absolutely should be! I also find it interesting that many of the reasons men find it harder to get laid are perpetuated by men themselves (pressuring women into not using condoms because it <dq>feels better<dq> for them even though sex is already generally more pleasurable for men than for women, being unwilling to pay for abortions or be an active part of their child<sq>s life, not being invested in their partner<sq>s orgasm as much as women are in their partners<sq>, perpetuating sexual violence far more often than women do, slut-shaming women, etc.).

There<sq>s not tonnes of figiting etc. They just seem to be able to settle into a position and become relaxed. This also goes for walking - which comes across as more deliberate and natural. They<sq>re also not generally concerned about how much space they occupy. Not like, randomly sprawling, but just able to keep square shoulders and longer strides. Especially as a woman, you can tell how confident they are when they<sq>re hitting on you, based on the space they<sq>re comfortable taking up. More confident guys tend to start closer to you (for instance when they sit down next to you at a bar), and not be so electrically aware of touching. Unconfident guys tend to get a bit jumpy, and sometimes almost glaze over when space starts to be closed.<br><br>In terms of speech, there<sq>s rarely much wavering, no squeaking. All relatively level or appropriate. They<sq>re not afraid to be loud, and are less apologetic if they<sq>re too loud (although I dislike that last bit). Some guys are more measured with their Words and are comfortable saying less, some talk tonnes. But you never really get the sense that they<sq>ve withdrawn or are critiquing themselves. They<sq>re present and aware of what they<sq>re saying. <br><br>In terms of eye contact, its moderate. They<sq>re not afraid to look away from the person they<sq>re talking to at the appropriate moment, and there<sq>s no sense of stress or anxiety if the other person looks away either. It<sq>s either an awareness that connection can happen without tonnes of effort (that<sq>s the ideal type of connection) or that they are still in play, important, whatever, even if a person is a bit more withdrawn. Its also an honest eye contact. No hesitation, straight into your eyes. There<sq>s a clear sense they<sq>re at ease with being scrutinised. <br><br>There<sq>s always going to be a sense of unfazedness in normal circumstances. I know I fuck up my coffee order if I<sq>m asked suddenly, but confident people don<sq>t seem to choke on their Words nearly as often. They<sq>re also fine when things go minorly wrong. Getting lost isn<sq>t an issue, they feel they can handle that (provided you have no where to be). Facing a drunk guy is just a case of going with the flow. there<sq>s often a sense that if something more serious happens, they<sq>re scanning the group to see just what kind of leader is needed and who<sq>s best suited. Some fall to ego here, but some are also capable of gracefully taking a back seat and adding advice when its needed. <br><br>Smiles tend to be more forth coming, but this could also be to do with confident people being more out going. If they don<sq>t smile often, then there<sq>s more of a calculating sense to them. They<sq>re comfortable being outside a group and watching reactions or just listening. <br><br>Basically, it comes down to ease. How at ease they are in and within themselves tends to translate to the ease at which they can do things. there<sq>s less fretting on their role and more attentiveness to the situation at hand.<br><br>Edit<colon> they<sq>re also way more calm and unfazed when being teased by friends or family. And while they<sq>ll happily dish it out, there<sq>s not often the same urgency to deflect, and are more open about embracing criticism. <br><br>EDIT 2<colon> Thanks for the best of and the gold. Its both humbling and a little bizarre. <br><br>Just a fee things, someone (ill edit this when I get his username, I<sq>m on a phone) mentioned confident people have an amazing ability to be heard, and this would include when they<sq>re quiet. And another guy commented saying that these people are confident for a reason, and you have to scratch the surface to find out why. he<sq>s absolutely right. I wrote this thinking about my friends at university who juggle their degrees with competitive sport, with running events on campus, with traveling all at the same time. <br><br>They<sq>re also really kind, likable guys. Being confident doesn<sq>t mean not being self aware of your failures or ignoring the strengths of others. You can be quietly proud of yourself without being a douchebag. In fact, please don<sq>t take away being a douchebag is good, and definitely don<sq>t take away being a psychopath. <br><br>With that, the space thing, when I said that I didn<sq>t mean to suggest they were space invaders or just hopped on top of people, and u certainly didn<sq>t mean to suggtest they didn<sq>t back off if need be. <br><br>This also isn<sq>t a checklist. Its something I wrote tired and stressed out of my brain at 3am. I will have missed things, and I might have misrepresented things. I<sq>ve also been told its way too lyrical and idealised, and it absolutely is. If you do want more advice on this topic, I<sq>d recommend /r/HowToNotGiveAFuck. But thanks for reading.<br><br>Edit 3<colon> Also please remember confidence is a situational thing.

I didn<sq>t go trying to hook up, but it happened a lot. My advice for those looking for that is to pick your guy ASAP because it always seemed that people would couple up and act like boyfriend and girlfriend for the whole week. Slim pickings by the middle of the week. There are usually more men than women, but never more than a few cute ones.<br><br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m late to the party. This is one of my favorite topics because my dad did everything right. And not many women can say that. <br><br>So dad grew up in a family with 8 kids. 5 were girls. He watched his sexist father oppress the hell out of his sisters. He hates most things about his father, so I<sq>d say out of spite he refused to do anything that man did. Fast-forward to him having 3 daughters (and no sons) of his own. And a very strong-willed wife. <br><br>My dad is also a science geek, and looks at most things from a logical perspective. So when conversations about sex and reproduction came up, he was completely non-emotional. He would excitedly go into age-appropriate detail about our bodies changing. Which sounds weird, but what it did was remove the weirdness. He would casually explain everything and make eye contact and let us ask any questions we had. Of course we would hold back because as children sex is icky. But as far as periods and boobs and stuff, we had questions. And he had the answers. We were armed with knowledge before our classmates, and before the surprises (like bloody underwear) happened. It was great. <br><br>My dad also didn<sq>t shy away from us when we did developed. We hear a lot of stories about little girls growing up playfully wrestling with dad and then she gets breasts and dad all of the sudden doesn<sq>t want to wrestle. He<sq>s afraid he might accidentally graze those private places. That<sq>s fine. But it<sq>s also devastating to a daughter who was used to, and experienced love through non-sexual physical touch. So my dad just switched it up. We would shoot hoops or play catch or race each other and ride bikes. And he would high five us and give us hugs. Touch is important. And I<sq>d like to add that a dad (and anyone but mostly dad<sq>s) can teach a daughter the difference between <dq>good touch<dq> and <dq>bad touch<dq> in this way. <br><br>He<sq>d always check in. Ask how we were doing. He asked about boys. Girls. Cramps. Shaving. Volleyball. Work. Whatever. It kept the door open for topics that might seem uncomfortable to address with a dad. If we retreated he respected it, but tossed in that he just asked because he cared. Sometimes just knowing someone cares is enough. <br><br>He didn<sq>t scream at us if we wore something that showed too much. He would calmly explain that although we looked beautiful no matter what we wore, modesty is not a bad thing. That sometimes leaving things to the imagination was better. And he never made us ashamed of our bodies, and all the busty parts that came with it. He understood that we were also exploring our sexuality and that sometimes we *wanted* the boys to see our cleavage. So he came at it from a different angle. Like explaining hormones and why we were suddenly interested in that kind of attention. But by that time he had already instilled in us what we should consider if a guy got too grabby, or if *we* got too grabby. And because we respected ourselves we didn<sq>t really need to dress to impress. <br><br>I think the most important thing was how he empowered us around other males. Peer pressure doesn<sq>t stop after high school. And sometimes his buddies or our guy friends would say things that he didn<sq>t support but most likely found it difficult to stand up against. Like sexist generalizations about women. I remember being with him and his good friend and his friend talking about women knowing their place and being <dq>bitches<dq> (sorry mods for that word but for my point I have to use it). It would have been easier for my dad to just kinda laugh it off. I remember feeling suffocated by his comments. I was a teenager that was supposed to respect people older than me and this friend had been in my life since birth. I couldn<sq>t say anything back. I hated that feeling. But my dad chimed in. All he said was <dq>I don<sq>t really think that joke is funny<dq> and it was enough to give me mental strength. Like <dq>yeah that guys an idiot what he says doesn<sq>t matter.<dq>  And my dad does that kind of thing all the time. It<sq>s great. <br><br>And of course he never acted weird if he needed to go to the store for pads and tampons. And he knew exactly what we needed if we sent him to the store. There was just no weirdness. I mean yeah we had secrets and the normal stuff, but I think generally he did a pretty good job. I<sq>m proud he is my father. I hope this helps. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>ll be there and also live in the area. A few things for the out-of-towners to know about getting around<colon><br><br>* Public transit around here is the [Metro](https<colon>//www.wmata.com/). Even if you drove in you should probably use the Metro because parking downtown is a nightmare of expense and availability. Especially with a big event like this going on.<br><br>* Federal Center SW is the closest Metro station (subway) to where the march is happening, but L<sq>Enfant Plaza and Capitol South are almost as close.<br><br>* The bus costs a flat $1.75 in cash (no change given) or using a SmarTrip card you can get from any Metro station. The Metro only accepts the SmarTrip card.<br><br>* A SmarTrip card is reusable and can be purchased and reloaded at any Metro station using cash, credit, or debit.<br><br>* The Metro charges based on what station you entered and which you left from. Every station has a chart showing the cost to go to every other station. Plan accordingly when loading your SmarTrip card.<br><br>* With a major event going on, the trains will be packed as they get near the event. There tends to be more space towards the ends of the train as everyone on the platform will generally try to board the middle.<br><br>* The Metro closes at midnight, so be where you want to be by then or be ready to use Uber.<br><br>That<sq>s pretty much it. Just follow the mob and you should get there just fine. I<sq>d offer couch space to crash on but I<sq>m full up as is. Hope y<sq>all make it here and back okay and have a good experience. If there are any other questions, hopefully me or another local can answer.<br><br>Edit<colon> Forgot to mention, the Metro describes which direction trains on the lines are going by the end station in that direction. For instance if I<sq>m trying to get to L<sq>Enfant Plaza from Virginia on the Yellow line, I<sq>m going to get the train going towards Fort Totten, not Huntington. When planning your route be aware of that, though if you see more people going one way, that is probably a good hint.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Here<sq>s what I think, as the mom of a high school junior. <br><br>A parent<sq>s job is to take kids from being infants who do need you to see to their every need, to adults who don<sq>t need you for anything at all (though hopefully they will want you around now and again). <br><br>A spouse<sq>s job is to be a partner in all the things life entails, without stopping, through whatever transitions come down the line. <br><br>There<sq>s a lot of overlap in these two things when spouses are parents. The shape of both things changes as time passes and the needs of kids change. In the beginning, the needs of a baby will be very immediate and obvious and yes, it does pretty much fall to parents to suck it up and deal with that. You can<sq>t really expect an infant to just wait with a poopy diaper while you handle stuff for someone who could handle things for themselves. But as kids get bigger, they start to have different kinds of needs, and things that are wants instead of needs, and then it actually is important to make sure those kids know their parents are people too, and that other people have needs too, and nobody exists just to meet another person<sq>s needs or wants. <br><br>One of the most empowering and awe inspiring moments I recall from my childhood was a day when I was 8 or 9 and it dawned on me fully that my parents were people and individuals just like me, and they had a relationship with each other that predated me and wasn<sq>t about me, even though it was the relationship that led to me and my sister being here. This meant I, too, as a kid, was empowered to have a life of my own that wasn<sq>t about my parents, or anybody else.  As I went through my teens and so on, this realization developed into a clear understanding that the world doesn<sq>t revolve around me, even though I<sq>m absolutely within my rights to be self actualized and want what I want and go after it, etc. <br><br>In a spouse type relationship, that life partnership thing, I -- like most people I suspect -- absolutely do need to know that there are times I come first, times when I am the highest priority. I need to know that my partner is able to look at the things that need handling and perform a sort of triage in which maybe, after all, a poopy diaper isn<sq>t quite as pressing as a suddenly burnt hand on a parent. Heck, I need to know that for myself and know that there is backup from my spouse. <br><br>As life goes on, this gets trickier too because the scope of the questions change. We you looking at, say, living somewhere that has a great school for the kids, but your wife is miserable and hates every single day of her life? That<sq>s not okay; your wife won<sq>t bear up long under that and it will affect the entire family. The flip side is true too of course, but you have to factor the adult needs into the big decisions as well as the kid needs. Or what if you<sq>ve only got a few hours a week when it would be possible to go out and do things just for fun? If you only ever choose to do those things with the kids, and you never ever pick your wife, then she is going to feel negative about it, and it also doesn<sq>t really do anything positive for the kids. <br><br>Lastly, there<sq>s the question of backup. You and your wife need to have each other<sq>s backs as parents. Your wife says no cookies right now? You hold that line too, you don<sq>t tell the kids to go ahead and have cookies because they<sq>ll only be kids the once. You back your wife, and then later, you talk separately and privately with your wife about how you disagreed. You make sure you<sq>re on the same page and you both make sure the other party knows they are respected in this. <br><br>It<sq>s not as simple as <dq>kids will always come first,<dq> if you want a relationship between the parents to last, OR if you want the kids to grow up independent and self aware and stuff. Sometimes, the same way a parent of an infant has to say, I don<sq>t get to take a shower until the babies are fed and in bed and the other parent is home, the parent of an older kid has to say, kid, we take you to activities every night of the week, but Thursday is out because your mom has her one thing that night, so the Thursday activity isn<sq>t happening. </p>",

I knew I never wanted to marry him, but knowing that he isn<sq>t in this world... I fought to not kill myself. Him not existing in this world was enough to no longer exist too.

If he left the door open to his room, at the back of the unit, I could smell it as soon as I walked in the front door.<br><br>He ate off my dishes and used my pots and pans to cook, but literally did dishes *one* time in the whole three months, and even then he only washed half the dirty dishes and left the rest in a sink of cold soapy water for me to finish. A month after that, I asked him to please wash one pot out for me since he left cheese crusted on it, and he flipped his shit complaining that he JUST washed dishes (a month prior).<br><br>He was also financially insolvent. He had a job, but he was always broke and pawning his things. When he ran out of his stuff to pawn, he started pawning things that belonged to the girl we were subletting from. When he ran out of that, he asked if he could pawn some of my shit, and I said no.<br><br>But the real kicker to all of this was that this guy had a kid, a 6 year old daughter. He didn<sq>t have custody, but sometimes had her on weekends, coming over and staying in his total sty of a bedroom. When Kiddo was over, his idea of spending time with her was to turn on Cartoon Network and sit on the couch by her, playing on his phone. She usually got bored and would come find an excuse to get into my room instead, and I<sq>d play with her or go outside with her. Zach had no idea how to entertain a kid, or how to feed a kid either. Every time she came over he fed her nothing but cheese pizza and yogurt and gatorade, even though he knew that at home with her mom she ate mostly vegan. Then he was totally at a loss when she started feeling gross from eating so much dairy and threw up on the kitchen floor. </p>",

Show them a picture and tell them what is going on.  Then they will know not to give this person information about you, and they can watch out for your safety.<br><br>You also want to keep a record of times that he contacts you or follows you.  If the behavior escalates and you need to go to the police, you want a clear record of what has been going on.<br><br>Finally, you probably want to look at the resources online for people who are victims of stalking.  Whether or not this person is dangerous, he is giving you unwanted obsessive attention, and those resources will give you strategies to handle it.<br><br>Edit/add<colon> I<sq>m at work and a little scatterbrained, I definitely agree with other posters that cops/campus police could get involved with this immediately.</p>",

But the fact that they<sq>d tell such a lie points to a problem in some so-called progressive circles. In order to justify some grey-area situations (like young teens experimenting with each other, or a 17 year old dating a 20 year old in a place where the age of consent is 17) they drag it to the logical conclusion (<dq>twelve year olds have 100<percent> agency over everything they do, love literally has no age, and how dare you imply a prepubescent woman is too stupid to know better!<dq>) for cool points. They<sq>re more worried about proving some point about agency that protesting the emotional safety (and in many cases, physical safety) of vulnerable people from predators. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Coming up on 4 years of marriage, over ten years together. He has depression and though I knew this, during an episode he began to become more and more worried about our relationship. The big thing happened several months before we were married. He rented an apartment without talking to me about it. I had no idea about the apartment but he became more distant than usual. His odd behavior lasted several weeks and I started to become very concerned. He left his laptop in an odd place, open to an apartment site. I checked history an saw he<sq>d been looking for an apartment for about two weeks. When I confronted him with this he seemed mostly unemotional and told me he thought he needed physical distance, that the pressure of living together and being responsible for my happiness was too much. Obviously I was deeply hurt but this was so out of character for him that I instantly knew this was a psychological issue and a very serious one. Sat him down and told him that his behavior was irrational and that I believed it was time to go to the doctor. I told him I would handle everything, I would make the appointment and take him there and be with him during the visit and all he had to do was explain to the doctor how he was feeling. He immediately broke down and agreed. We went to the doctor and got emergency anti-depressants, made an appt with a psychiatrist and within another two weeks or so everything was back on track. He got his money back for the apartment. <br><br>Months later, we<sq>re getting ready for our vacation during which we<sq>re going to get married. He begins acting oddly again. I wait for a week and finally bring it to his attention and he explains that he<sq>s quit taking the medication, cold turkey and that he hasn<sq>t followed up with the doc or the psychiatrist. I convince him to get back on the meds and and talk to the doc.<br><br>Fast forward to a year into our marriage. He<sq>s stopped taking meds but the depressive cycles are more manageable because he will discuss them with me and we<sq>ve worked out a bit of a system. Still, he hit another significant low and on talking about he says he thinks maybe we shouldn<sq>t be married. I try everything I can think of in terms of talking but finally after a few weeks I submit. <dq>If a divorce is really what you want, if you truly believe this will help you to be a happier healthier person then I will agree to a divorce, because more than anything, I love you and want you to be able to be happy. But I am so incredibly sad to lose you... I wanted to grow old with you. I CAN let you go but I cannot continue to try to convince you to stay.<dq> <br><br>After that conversation, he very suddenly was deeply committed to us again. Since then we<sq>ve occasionally struggled but it<sq>s never been as difficult and he<sq>s never said he wants to leave. It could be that he needed to know that I would let him go if that<sq>s what he really wanted. It could be that with diet and exercise many of his symptoms have been mitigated. It could be that our communication has improved so dramatically that he now experiences his depression differently. Regardless, we<sq>ve been through a lot worse now, things not related to our relationship, things which have strengthened our friendship, our love and our commitment. We have a lot of good systems in place. We didn<sq>t necessarily have to work <sq>hard<sq> but we<sq>ve been very creative in our approach to problems I suppose. Of course, this little anecdote is a simplification of what occurred. To write out all of my feelings and his, everything I tried and he tried, it would take too long. Suffice it to say, we respect and admire each other deeply. Sometimes we are so obviously, so deeply in love. Sometimes we<sq>re annoyed or bored or tired of each other. But so far, we have always valued each other. We have always looked out for one another and when one person takes their hands off the wheel, for ANY reason, the other one always drives for a while.</p>",

I was fortunate enough to be assigned to a very good work environment, and have had the pleasure of working with some very good people.

However, it wasn<sq>t completely free of a little drama. <br><br>A few examples I can think of<colon><br><br>In basic training one of my drill sergeants made three women dance erotically for him in private, under the guise of auditioning for a traditional role that involves doing a silly dance to a tune when you go to the dining facility. <br><br>In AIT one of my instructors gathered up all the women and gave us a lecture about our male counterparts. <dq>They do not respect you, they don<sq>t like you, they are not your friends. You only have one use to them. They already think that you are lazy, they think you are weak,<dq> etc (this was like an hour long lecture). I understand that that is not true for all men, let alone male service members and while it was happening we were all was just getting offended and pissed off. Women know that not all men are jerks, and it was offensive to hear someone talk about people we had come to be friends with like that. The thought of it being true is still something that scares me, though. I can<sq>t forget it. <br><br>I worked in medical, which is a field that is somewhat traditionally more welcoming to women than other military jobs. I only ever had to help three women who came to us for treatment for sexual assault, which is pretty good considering the statistics on sexual assault for Army personnel. I never personally saw any men come in for sexual assault, but I<sq>m not sure if they would have felt comfortable telling me about it in the first place. It does happen though, and it<sq>s not something that should be ignored.<br><br>I worked with several other young women in a small brigade aid station, but mostly it was staffed by men. In this situation we were all comrades. We all treated each other with respect, and the men I worked with were some of the most professional medical personnel and best role models I<sq>ve ever worked with. It was the patients who were the problem sometimes. <br><br>Part of day to day work involved being alone in a room (for patient privacy) with another person, often times needing to remove parts of their clothing to do things like treat a wound or other procedures. Sometimes people would take this a cue to behave inappropriately with unwanted touching or flirting.

How on earth does anyone think that<sq>s appropriate, let alone how do you even get an erection from something like that?<br><br>Fortunately any time something like this happened to anyone all we had to do was leave the room and report it to a supervisor. I had some really great leaders who handled delicate situations very well. <br><br>Overall I<sq>d say my military experience was positive, but I know I was lucky. I know a lot of other women who have had to deal with true nightmares. Thanks for asking, I<sq>ve never really had an appropriate outlet to tell anyone any of these things.

Note<colon> I started poling at age 40, so by the time I started teaching, I found myself in front of a wall of mirrors in a room full of young women half my age, teaching them how to bring their sexy out.

Do something selfless for someone else. Tutor kids at reading at the local library. Become a Girl Scout leader. Volunteer at the battered women<sq>s shelter. Do something for someone else and expect nothing in return. You may begin to see yourself in a whole new light. <br><br>And I would strongly recommend listening to Brene Brown<sq>s TED talks about shame and guilt. Well worth your time. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I used to be very insecure about the way I looked (I still have many insecurities but to a lesser extent). I had acne, was pretty chubby, didn<sq>t know how to deal with my hair, wore braces and didn<sq>t really dress well. None of those things should be make you feel lesser, but it<sq>s normal to feel bad about them just because of how mean people can be. I ended up trying to <dq>fix<dq> myself for the longest time. I obsessed over my appearance. I ate way too little, got on accutane, googled anything to do with hair care etc. I thought that when I reached my end goal I<sq>d be ok with myself. I was wrong though.<br><br> I was still very insecure and depressed. I felt worthless. Looking back, the reasons should have been apparent. But it<sq>s hard to really see yourself in an objective way, especially when you feel there<sq>s nothing worth looking for. Anyway, I was perpetuating a cycle of self-hate. Every time I looked back on slmething I had done I would focus intently on ANY sort of mistake, no matter how small. Let the shame sweep over me. This affected me when dealing with peers by making me shut up so as not to <dq>embarrass<dq> myself and accept any criticism thrown at me as absolute truth. I welcomed hate and saw compliments as just pity. This made me accept some really shit friends that would step all over me. I was constantly on guard and scared of being judged. <br><br>Well, one day, something amazing happened. I met my best friend. Emotionally, she was everything I wasn<sq>t. She didn<sq>t give a rat<sq>s ass about anyone<sq>s opinion, she loved herself including whatever flaws she may have had and was pretty social. She wouldn<sq>t take shit from anyone. We spent everyday of senior year together and I learned a lot from her. She wouldn<sq>t allow me to shit on myself. She did everything to make me feel beautiful inside and out. I began to feel like I mattered. Not only that, but she pointed out negative behaviours in me such as<br><br>1. Always being self-deprecating, even jokingly. She would always counter my self-hate jokes with something positive about me.<br>2. Seeing criticism where there wasn<sq>t any. You know how sometimes you can over analyse even the most innocent comment from someone? I did that a LOT.<br>3. Obsessing over making myself more acceptable to others rather than just finding good things that were already there.<br><br>So, you can see she helped me a lot. Now, I know you might not have people like her in your life. And I know you probably have the loudest voice in your head that narrates some anxiety inducing reality show called <dq>Look at that Fuck Up<dq>. Sometimes you might not even realise it, but it<sq>s there. What worked for me is trying to catch myself when I look for flaws or deprive myself of things that make me happy. <br><br>You need to make up some voice that<sq>s louder than the inner self-hatred, even if it feels fake and forced. If you begin to feel a tightness in your chest and find yourself thinking of the supposed piece of shit you are, truly force yourself to say the opposite. You don<sq>t have to believe it, just keep going. It may take a while, but it helps so much.<br><br>Also, cut out any toxic people from your life. But you need to be careful to see if those relationships are truly toxic or if you<sq>re projecting your insecurities onto them. You may perceive that people dislike you just because you dislike yourself. So look out for that. Again, try the voice thing. Walk into a room and shout in your head, <dq>EVERYONE HERE WANTS TO LIKE ME<dq>. I know that sounds ridiculous and it is definitely not as easy as I<sq>m making it out to be, but please try it. After a while and a perhaps quite a few mistakes, you<sq>ll be able to tell the well meaning from the actual mean people. I also used to judge people a lot to feel better about myself. It was unconscious and really toxic. Try to actively seek positive things in others if this is a trait you also share with me.<br><br>Another thing that is crucial is to open up to those you trust and if you don<sq>t have anyone you trust, open up to support groups on the internet or in real life. It<sq>s ok to be insecure. Just don<sq>t let it define you. Pamper yourself. Be selfish about your happiness. <br><br>Make a list of things you love and by all means pursue them! Make to do lists of things you want in your life and work towards them. You cannot allow yourself to make excuses for giving up or hiding from things that will lead you to your goals. When you realise that you are toying with the idea of stopping, actively push yourself forward.  My therapist made me see that I was denying myself happiness for the sake of being comfortably miserable. It<sq>s a slow but brutal death for your hopes and dreams. <br><br>Call yourself positive things, even if you don<sq>t believe them. I<sq>m still chubby, but what helps a lot is just standing naked in front of a mirror and  saying out loud that I am totally sexy. Give yourself a chance. In the end, these thoughts will become more natural and you will find the right people. Of course, this is all my experience and I don<sq>t want to make blanket statements about such deeply personal matters. Therapy can be immensely helpful and sometimes there are chemical imbalances in your head that make you feel this way, so looking into it is always a good idea. I hope that at least something I<sq>ve written has helped in even the slightest way. </p>",

Even though she has said she doesn<sq>t like it. That<sq>s just a bit odd. I see on Reddit everywhere how you should never ever ever have sex with anyone unless you obtain direct verbal consent. Absolutely with new partners or in situations where it isn<sq>t so straightforward, but seriously... <br><br>Also saw a girl post in r/relationships asking if she should break up with her four year boyfriend because they were cuddling and he started kissing her without asking first. That<sq>s just a tad extreme in my opinion. <br><br>Again, to clarify, I in no way am saying consent isn<sq>t a necessary thing. It<sq>s just the extremity of it that people hold it to in Reddit.

I played with it, felt no problem...<br><br>>But whatever, I<sq>d be willing to keep good relations, and I offered to pay for it.  **$80.00.**  I was blown away, but I said okay, even though I had absolutely no money, my parents were at that point $350,000 in debt.  I ashamedly borrowed it from my mother and he pestered me for the money every day for a week until I was able to go home and get the cash.  Sidestory over]]<br><br>One day, we were all in the room while my girlfriend was visiting and his mother came in, and MAN she is the biggest fuckin<sq> _____ _____ ______ ____ in the planet.  Almost forgot I was in /r/AskWomen.<br><br>She brought <dq>her sweet little prince<dq> a replacement mouse (an exact copy of what he had) as a gift, and then ANOTHER $110.00 MOUSE IN ADDITION TO THAT.  For his brand-new Alienware gaming desktop.  This was the day I learned his family is fucking LOADED.  Saw my girlfriend was sitting on my lap at my desk and laughed, saying <dq>oh, girls have so little modesty these days<dq>.  I didn<sq>t say anything and tried keeping my cool because all our relationships were deteriorating enough already and I was too chicken anyway.<br><br>She started literally moving my shit around, saying it would look better if my desk were facing the wall THIS way, and brought in a new carpet and started pulling mine up.  I looked to her son and said, <dq>we didn<sq>t discuss this, did we?<dq>  and he just ignored me.<br><br>Then she brought him a new bag of nuts, and I finally spoke up.  <dq>Hey, uh, I have this really bad nut allergy, could you take those and that other bag with you?<dq><br><br><dq>A nut allergy huh?  Oh, I have an allergy too.  You<sq>ll be fine.<dq>  And she<sq>s out the door.<br><br><dq>Wait!<dq><br><br>She stops.<br><br><dq>No, this is really serious, I<sq>m not living in such an enclosed space where I could die because your son wants his nuts.  Please.<dq><br><br><dq>Oh, please, they<sq>re not going to *jump out and attack you*.  Just get over it and be careful.<dq><br><br>She just echoed what my stepmother said when I was young, while she served my siblings peanut butter sandwiches for lunch, and that really threw me off.  I just begged her one last time and she groaned, <dq>Fine.  God.<dq>  and left.<br><br>Of course, I was in a terrible mood from that point on, and eventually I just moved all my shit into my girlfriend<sq>s double (which also has 3 people crammed into it).  Res Life refused to move me, so I got my allergy registered as a disability.  They still refused to move me, so I told them I was living in a triple with three girls in the meeting, so they got super flustered and gave me a single to live in.<br><br>Hate that fucking school.<br><br>Also, end note, I gave the mouse to my mother three years ago.  It was only $30.00 when I had given him the money (he bought it six months prior and it was outdated) and she says it<sq>s the best mouse she<sq>s ever had.<br><br>I think that was the longest post I<sq>ve ever made on reddit.  Guess something needed to get off my chest.</p>",

These are all generalizations from my experiences dating, I\u2019m not saying that this is how everyone acts, just that this is how I\u2019ve seen these red-flags exhibited when they show up in the people I\u2019ve dated.<br><br>* Profession of deep feelings too soon. I\u2019ve found that women are more likely than men to express deep feelings sooner than I\u2019m comfortable with, they tend to look for a more serious relationship sooner. Conversely, men are much less likely to know what they want. I get more mixed signals from men than women by far. I\u2019ve had more men say they want a casual relationship, then get their feelings involved, where women tend to know if they want something serious or not.<br><br>* Jealousy, anger, or similar emotional issues. Men are more frequently jealous or have anger issues, while women will be more passive aggressive or need validation. Both are equally unappealing, though the anger issues are much scarier. Men seem to be afraid that you\u2019ll be taken away from them by some \u201cother\u201d; women are afraid that you\u2019ll leave them of your own volition.<br><br>* Competitiveness with other people or showing a sense of ownership over me. Men will be more openly jealous, competitive, or territorial than women, though I\u2019ve met women who do that too.<br><br>* Poor money management. I haven\u2019t noticed a difference between men and women here. If they\u2019re bad with money it\u2019s usually because they\u2019re parents are.<br><br>* Poor relationships with family, friends, or all exs (i.e. \u201call my exs are b*tches!\u201d). These also don\u2019t seem to have a gender bias, though the way men and women describe people is different. <br><br>The single lesbian-specific red flag I\u2019ve encountered is animosity or distrust towards bisexual women, or towards men. Some lesbians are uncomfortable dating bisexual women, which is fine, but an obvious red flag to me as a bisexual woman.</p>",

It was also diverse enough, that each member had something to offer the sorority. That was the primary reason I joined- it wasn<sq>t the typical blonde-haired cookie cutter group, who didn<sq>t live up to sorority stereotypes. The girls who rushed me were quirky, fun, and wholesome- and I appreciated that.<br><br>*I was able to secure an internship through social media by networking with an active in another chapter.

That happens everywhere you go. We are a pretty tight group.<br><br>*I found that being in the Greek System provided privilege, which has it<sq>s added benefits<colon> fun parties, free concert tickets, more free activities, etc. It wasn<sq>t all fun and games- I really enjoyed getting involved with our philanthropic organizations and I will continue to make donations even after I graduate, so it has been a great learning opportunity for me.<br><br>*It<sq>s nice knowing I can go anywhere in the country and have sisters around who I share a common bond with. <br><br>*I<sq>ve met some of my best friends.

Being in/out of the sorority is not the be all, end all.<br><br>Worst<colon><br><br>*I was not in what is considered an <dq>Upper-Tier<dq> sorority, so I had to deal with the pettiness which came with that.

There<sq>s a lot of pressure and if you step out of line, it<sq>s not unlikely to see someone say something nasty about you on social media.

That said, it<sq>s not a fraternity thing, it<sq>s a people thing.<br><br>*Public Relations dictating what I can/can<sq>t wear to class. <br><br>*The mob-mentality. I am a very independent person and I can form my own opinions. I often stirred up controversy by going my own way on several issues. I wore jorts one day, and received too many dirty looks to count. It was silly. I also like Star Wars, so that<sq>s branded me as subversive (I mean, I<sq>m not watching Gossip Girl)<br><br>*Fines. OMG, the fines.

Unfortunately due to pressing charges in my first year I was <dq>black listed<dq> from greek life and was seen as a liability. Luckily a sorority opened up a colony and actual adult fucking human beings chose who became a member of the founding group. I was one of those. It was great for a year and a half. I became a VP and was very involved. I loved everything about my sorority. <br><br>In my third year there was an off campus Halloween camping trip (aka a <dq>Party<dq>) and because 7 sisters were going it was labeled a <dq>sisterhood event.<dq> Now my school was hardcore about drinking rules and when the President of the chapter found out there would be drinking (but no men and no driving and 3/7 were 21) she shut down the Party. She shut it down so hard that 3 girls lost positions in the sorority and everyone had disciplinary action taken. I was not invited to the party, so I was safe from this. It just struck me as a stupid overreaction.<br><br>That was until Halloween actually happened. On that night 2 of the underage girls who *would* have been camping with girlfriends went to the off campus party for the fraternity that I got kicked off campus. I heard they were there and flipped my shit. I tried to get into said party to get these girls out of there. I got in, and found one puking in the bathroom and the other downing shots. I tried to get them out, but the guys realized who I was and made me leave without them. <br><br>Yeah, can you see where this is going? Both were raped. They would have been safe, but being <dq>perfect<dq> got in the way of being a fucking pragmatic human being and these two women were hurt. I blew up. I would raise motions in chapter meetings for the president to acknowledge that her choice directly put people into danger and was called in for disciplinary action every week for about 2 months. It was stressful and I ended up have health consequences because of it.<br><br>My two cents are that I have been on both sides of the sorority situation and I can definitively say that my experience sucked balls. Yeah, you will probably never get hurt and could have a great experience, but why would you willingly opt in to greek life? You can see in the news that there are just never ending lists of abuse. Even if that isn<sq>t the norm, why increase the risk of getting hurt.<br><br>Join a sports team if you want friends. Its about 800x less hassle and more fun.</p>",

I felt bleak, but this felt like my only way out and the only step I could control between myself and total loss of my current life. Even while applying and working on my resume I felt like the hammer could fall anytime.<br><br>But... after a few weeks of diligent applying I started hearing back from places. Turns out during a recession anyone with a little experience and resume savvy who was willing to get back to work ASAP and take a bit of a pay cut was in high demand. I ended up getting 5 job offers in the span of 3 weeks. <br><br>I can<sq>t tell you how relieved I was and how proud I was of all my hard work in the face of wanting to just lay down and die. It was a pivotal learning moment for me - I figured out that continuing to push on when all seemed hopeless and clinging to even the smallest glimmer of light gave me just enough stamina to keep going day after day until I caught a break.<br><br>It reminded me of my favourite quote by the great Canadian poet Leonard Cohen<colon> forget your perfect offering, there is a crack in everything, that<sq>s how the light gets in.<br><br>Things WILL get better - I hope you find the other side soon and find your light.</p>",

You can get a job that is satisfying and tolerable with pleasant hours and benefits, to give you the money you need to dedicate the rest of your life to all the things that do make you happy.<br><br>For myself, I went into college wanting to be a lawyer, but knowing that law school was expensive, and you can do basically anything undergrad.  I also knew that you can get a job with a bachelors in a scientific field that is likely to pay for law school.  So I took a Physics scholarship, but when I realized I didn<sq>t like Physics, I switched to Comp Sci.  Graduated with a BA in CS, started working as a Software Developer with the intention of saving/using workplace education subsidies to go to law school, and liked my job so much that I never wanted to.<br><br>Now I work as a Software Engineer at a small startup and I love it.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Spend based on your budget, not your emotion. Live your life at the right time - what I mean is, don<sq>t get married/have a baby/buy a home because everyone else is, but do it when it<sq>s right for you (and your spouse).<br><br>Keep your credit card limit low. Mine was at the minimum ($1000) for years and that really helped me reign in spending. I also used a <sq>cash back<sq> credit card that I totally forgot about, and when I cancelled my card for a different one I actually had a big cash payout at the end (a little over $900). That was a really lucky windfall, and it kind of blew my mind.<br><br>Budget and always pay yourself first. I know that seems like common sense but as my mother always says, <dq>who says common sense is common?<dq> I <sq>ignore<sq> the money that pays the bills. It goes into my direct deposit account and I do not touch it. It doesn<sq>t belong to me. You wouldn<sq>t steal money from your friend<sq>s purse and spend that, would you? So don<sq>t steal from yourself, either.<br><br>Really understand what <dq>want<dq> and <dq>need<dq> are to YOU. My <sq>want <sq> and <sq>need<sq> are different from yours, and yours are different from mine. For example, I have a stressful job (but I do enjoy it) and so to keep my stress managed, I <sq>need<sq> a monthly massage. On the flip-side, I <sq>want<sq> a really nice car, but I don<sq>t <sq>need<sq> one. It goes back to budget vs emotion spending. <br><br>Know that you WILL be <sq>financially successful<sq> at some point, but it<sq>s going to take time to get there. Also, define  the term for yourself. For me, after growing up watching my mother struggle with debt so much, my idea of financial success is <sq>zero debt, at least a one-month cushion to pay bills, a comfortable lifestyle with the ability to address emergency expenses, and having money in the bank when the next cheque rolls in<sq>. Yours is probably really different.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m not sure how you define <dq>very<dq>, but I have what I think are some good tips for financial success.<br><br>* Start by doing everything you can to get awesome grades in high school. Become a great test taker and join a couple of clubs. You<sq>ll have your pick of universities and often won<sq>t have to pay to attend. (I live in the US where student loan debt is huge problem.) I graduated at the top of my class, got many scholarships, and graduated from college with zero debt. My parents would never have been able to afford for me to go to a good school.<br>* Get a degree or intensive, accredited training in a field where skilled workers are in high demand. Sorry, but this is the time to leave your rock star dream behind if you can name more than 10 people in the world who are better at it than you. My partner and I are software engineers. This is THE field right now. My partner is a CTO and his company throws money and crazy perks at talented 22-year-old engineers to get them to accept job offers. This type of recruit has the freedom to turn down multiple high-paying job offers if they<sq>re not exactly what they<sq>re looking for.<br>* Work hard. Make yourself irreplaceable in your workplace. Study new things in your off time so that you<sq>re always learning something.<br>* Save. Don<sq>t assume that you will always have this money. (Edit<colon> If you can afford it, get a fiduciary to help you make your savings work for you according to your goals.)<br>* Don<sq>t lend people money. If someone you care about deeply is in a bind, get the terms of the loan written up so that they are legally valid.<br>* Teach yourself the value of money. Living in cramped spaces with few possessions opened my eyes to what material things I actually use and need. Enjoy your money, but don<sq>t spend it on shit you don<sq>t need just because you can.<br>* Editing for the one I forgot (which of course had to be one of the most important pieces)<colon> Network the shit out of everyone. Even if you<sq>re inwardly bad at peopling, or hate people\u2014and believe me, I am and I do\u2014those connections will come in handy for you, and often at unexpected times. Grin and bear it, and pretty soon you will be known as the friendly one, the efficient one, the one who is always willing to go the extra mile.</p>",

Just took all the <dq>your dad<sq>s gay<dq> jokes and jabs his friends made in his stride, but it was killing him on the inside. Bright side, this realisation has helped him make significant progress in therapy!<br><br>Edit<colon> Forgot to add this, didn<sq>t see the second part to the question! We got back to the hotel, told him he we didn<sq>t have to talk about anything he didn<sq>t want to, washed him in the bath like a baby, tried to goof around with him by swaddling him like a baby in the spare hotel blanket and I brushed his hair while he was wrapped up in his blanket cocoon until he fell asleep. His dad invited us back round for breakfast in the morning, and he said he didn<sq>t feel strong enough to go. I told him he was in fact strong for not holding it in anymore, and that I would literally hold his hand under the table the entire time if he decided to go back in the morning. He went, and we got a lot of funny looks from everyone while both of us tried to eat a cooked breakfast one-handed ha! Never been more proud of him. </p>",

I knew it before she called, I couldn<sq>t feel him on this earth anymore. I will never forget that feeling. I commented this on a similar thread<colon> <br><br>>I lost the love of my life 6 years ago to a tragic accident. It was closed casket and I never felt like I got real closure, and I felt like I never got the real story on how it happened. I felt like my life had ended. He was one of the most beautiful souls that ever walked into my life and taught me so much about love, what kind of love into deserve, life, loving myself, and literally everything in between. He was my best friend in life. <br><br>>I want you to know it gets better. I know people tell you that, and it<sq>s hard to believe. But I<sq>ve been there and it does. The pain and heartache sticks with you, especially when you wake up from the all to real dreams about them, or smell them, or hear a song that really makes you think of them. But it gets better. The best advice I can give you is to embrace all the pain, hurt, anger, everything. You have to feel all of that bad stuff to be able to get to the point where you<sq>re remembering the good stuff and smiling about it. Don<sq>t blame yourself. I found plenty of ways to blame myself over the years and it<sq>s all wrong. Don<sq>t do it. Ever. Don<sq>t move on too quickly and don<sq>t tell yourself you have to move on in a certain amount of time. Also don<sq>t let yourself get stuck in your grief. Don<sq>t tell yourself you<sq>ll never feel that way again, that you<sq>ll never meet someone else again, you will. Don<sq>t compare anyone to him because no one can compare. Talking about it helps but you don<sq>t have to if you<sq>re not ready. You will be okay, you will make it through this. It will take a long time but I promise you it gets better.<br><br>>I still have days where I cry about it. I<sq>ve talked to my friends about it but it<sq>s not as easy talking to someone who hasn<sq>t been through such a thing. It<sq>s a different kind of pain and heartache. Keep your memories close, you will be okay, keep his voice in your head telling you to move forward, you can do this.<br><br>I really hope that helps. To be honest no one can give you a time when it will feel any better. There is no time line for grief. You<sq>re not required to stop crying after X amount of time. It took me 2 years to even go back to his grave. I kept him alive in my head for as long as I could. None of that was healthy, I realize it now. But I wanted to believe he<sq>d show up at my door one day and it<sq>d have all been just a bad dream. I still cry about it. Every time a relationship fails I tell myself if he was still alive, I wouldn<sq>t have to deal with any of this. But at the end of the day, I know without any doubt whatsoever he<sq>d kick me in my ass and tell me to wipe my face off and keep on living. When we were just friends and I<sq>d go through a hard time he<sq>d tell me <sq>redbird_ Get real and keep living life<sq> He was tough love when I needed it, and I tell myself those things every time I<sq>m having a rough time. I<sq>m sure your love would want you to do the same, and I<sq>m sure you<sq>ve heard that a million times but it helps to remember that, it really does.<br><br>I<sq>m sorry this is a small novel.

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m 40, and for me, the way I<sq>m treated has more to do with my current weight and whether or not I have children in tow.<br><br>Regarding children<colon>  I had my first child very young - I was 20.  Even though I was in the <dq>full bloom of youth<dq> at the time, have that stereotypical stuff that men tend to like (extreme hourglass figure, large boobs, blonde hair, blue eyes), and was rocking a body that a year of breastfeeding only made better, when my baby was with me in public I was invisible.  I would see guys doing their normal thing of scanning the horizon all around them, their eyes settling on the ones they<sq>d do and passing right over the ones they wouldn<sq>t.  They never even let their eyes settle on me.  The baby made me effectively invisible.  Going out in public without my baby elicited the normal car horns, animal noises, leers and whiplash double-takes. <br><br>At work the baby wasn<sq>t an issue.  There, it was my weight that determined my treatment.  When thin I was constantly flirted with and treated to little special favors and extras.  Getting hired to jobs was a breeze.  Very few men found it inappropriate to constantly compliment me on my looks, my hair, my clothes, etc.  Even in a professional environment the men were shameless about staring at my tits. Women were as catty to me as men were schmoozy.  You<sq>d think my tits grew out of the fertile compost of my moral failures or something.  <br><br>However, for all the flirting and trivial favors and special treatment and such, getting promoted or acknowledged for my talents and strengths was difficult.  In order to secure promotions and gain responsibility at work, I had to start pulling my hair back severely, stop wearing makeup and <dq>frump up<dq> my clothing a bit.  Even that was not terribly successful.<br><br>Gaining 30 pounds, however, was super effective at stopping all the flirting.  However, it also seemed to come with an attitude that I must be a little bit of a mental wreck, that I must not have my shit entirely together if I was <dq>letting myself go<dq> in such a way.  Men didn<sq>t flirt as much or stare as much, but they also developed a condescending tone with me, as if I was just a hausfrau doing a temporary stint as a secretary instead of mid-level supervisor.  I had to develop a very firm attitude with people because as soon as the flirting ended, the subtle bullying, marginalization and put-downs began.  <br><br>As I got older my kids got older, and I was out in public with them less.  I continued to be invisible when my kids were around, regardless of my weight.  Then my kids turned into beautiful blonde, blue-eyed teenage athletes and I amused myself by counting the number of neck injuries sustained by passing men as my girls dared to go out in public while being blatantly attractive.  Now my 20-year-old daughter reports experiencing a lot of what I did at her age, in terms of the antagonism from other women and the leering and nonsense from men.  The amount of antagonism from other women has made her too self-conscious to even wear tank tops in public, or clothing that is too close-fitting.  She even checks her shorts for length using the stupid rules from high school, just to be sure she<sq>s not dressing in a way that will elicit maximum hatefulness from any women she encounters in public.<br><br>In my 30<sq>s I dropped the extra weight and started going to the gym a lot.  I have found that now, I don<sq>t get honked at or screamed at as much as before, but I still get a lot of double-takes by men of all ages.  However, whereas when I was 20 it was mostly 20-ish and some 30-ish men doing most of the sizing up, now men old enough to have completely white hair are also noticing me and making me aware of it.  I kind of appreciate the older guys.  Instead of them just looking at me like a piece of meat and making a mental check on the <dq>Would do<dq> list before moving on, these older men will relax into the leering, take their time with it.  They will hold out for eye contact, wait for me to notice them looking.  Then they will give an appreciative smile or even a wink.  They aren<sq>t just making a list of the chicks in the room they<sq>d poke, they<sq>re letting those women know that they are desirable.  Most of the older men just ignore my daughters and focus on me.  Sometimes if they do give my daughters the eye, they seem guilty and awkward about it, as if they are embarrassed to have those feelings.  <br><br>At work, being thin at my age makes me a contender.  Nobody would ever admit it, but looking around at the organization I work for I can see that most in high ranking positions are my age or older, of average weight or close to it, and are at least somewhat attractive as well as looking healthy in general.  The younger people get hired, but they don<sq>t get promoted until they look like me.  The ones who get old and fat just kind of stagnate in place.  These are generalizations, but they hold up not only in my regional office but in all the offices across the state that I have visited.  It may be more exaggerated in my field since I<sq>m in a healthcare-related industry, so that should be considered.  <br><br>How do I feel about all this?  Mixed.  I don<sq>t like the societal bigotry regarding size and what that ostensibly says about a person, and I reject it whenever I feel like I am responding to those prejudices within myself.  I admit that I have kept track of which way the wind was blowing and used it to my advantage over the years.  I do not feel like acknowledging the game and learning how to play it necessarily means I agree with it, and I do hope for change.  I don<sq>t let looks play a part in my decisions as far as hiring and promotions go, although understanding how to groom yourself and dress in a professional manner are still to be considered in public-facing jobs.<br><br>As for personally, I have always hated car honks and animal noises.  Fuck those guys.  Seriously.  I ignore the looks, and I graciously smile back when someone makes the effort to catch my eye and smile, but when someone approaches me in a business setting and starts complimenting me on my looks, I refuse to acknowledge it and immediately steer the conversation into something business-relevant.  If they continue trying to talk about my looks I am firm about telling them to knock it off because it makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable, as if my professionalism is being ignored in favor of being commended as eye candy, as if I need to be eye candy in addition to the value I bring to my company.  (which, I think, probably has helped me get to where I am, but I still feel like this is wrong and I try to be an example of doing it differently, if only in my own department.) For the most part in the past 20 years the sexual harassment and flirting at work has curtailed tremendously.  I think the younger ones still do it a bit, but after about age 30 if you keep up that shit you get marginalized at work pretty quickly.  The younger guys in particular would never dare flirt with me, because I<sq>m a boss.<br><br>When I was fat and invisible, I did miss the looks a little.  Not specifically - I wasn<sq>t actually missing the leering in public.  But it<sq>s an ego caress even if it<sq>s annoying, and I did notice that I was no longer getting those random ego caresses from random strangers on a daily basis.  <br><br>EDIT<colon>  Thank you very much to whoever gave me the Gold!</p>",

She was afraid that he would kill the cat one day when she wasn<sq>t there. <br><br>She was right. I offered to take the cat to the shelter I volunteered at, and we skipped our afternoon classes so I could drive us to her house and get the cat. We arrived to see her father outside with the cat in the cage and a gun in his hand. He was *very* drunk. She shoved the cat in my car, and I peeled out of there before the situation could escalate.<br><br>The kitten was six months old- physically, being kept in a hamster cage damaged her spine. She<sq>s 8 years old now and winters are very hard for her. She and I spent a lot of quality time in vet offices talking about pain management options. In addition, her previous owners fed her dog food which lacks several vitamins that cats need for healthy vision. We<sq>re not sure just how bad her vision is, but I know that she has a hard time judging distances, and she can<sq>t see the bird feeder that is 10ft from the window.<br><br>Personality-wise, that cat hates everyone and everything on this planet...except for me. She has a serious case of hero worship for me. If I<sq>m asleep, she literally guards the door against intruders. In February, she actually alerted me to a home invader before they shattered the window and came inside! <br><br>She will cuddle me and beg for attention, but I have to tell everyone *not to touch the cat* because she bites with no warning and she will draw blood. For some reason, people always think that they are going to be the exception to that rule. I have a white board with a tally count of people that have lost that bet.</p>",

We think the spent most of her life in a cage - her back legs were very weak from not using them much, and she had some bladder control issues from all the litters. <br><br>She was the sweetest dog I<sq>ve ever met. Incredibly happy and friendly - even just going out in the yard seemed like a new wonderful experience for her. She basked in attention. If my dad gave my mom a kiss when he got home from work without giving the dog a pat, she would get in-between them and bark until he crouched down and said hello to her too. She was fascinated by the TV - she would watch it for hours, and if there were puppies on Animal Planet, she would get up on her (very weak) hind legs and whine to try and get close to them. <br><br>She ended up wearing a diaper for a year because her of her bladder issues. She started having seizures, and after trying some different medications to treat it and failing, my parents had to put her down.

Words like <dq>disgusting<dq> were never associated with anything coming from the genitals (even period blood) until my peers in high school would talk about such things, and I thought it was weird that they considered normal body parts disgusting and it never caught on with me. <br><br>If you feel this is hindering your sex life I think the best way to go about solving the problem would be to try and associate positive thoughts with your vulva. You don<sq>t have to do every thing at once, but try, every week maybe, to do something body-positive with that area. Incorporate something new into your routine to associated positive feelings with that area. Choose a favorite word to use to refer to that area (vaginal, vulva, genitals, pussy, even cunt if you like it) and try to associate positive feelings with it. Get turned on, touch yourself and say <dq>my pussy makes me feel so good.<dq> Do it during sex. Ask your partner to compliment it and then agree with him out loud. <br><br>Do you look at your genitals? Shower, groom in your preferred manner, lie down with a handheld mirror and take a look in good lighting. Look at it and say <dq>I look great!<dq> I know this probably sounds really weird, but I have seriously been doing this since I started developing (out of curiosity) and I have absolutely NO insecurities about that area. Also, if you don<sq>t look regularly, you won<sq>t know what you<sq>re looking for if you think you have a problem, it<sq>s also a health issue. <br><br>Normalize your genitals and associate them with positivity and you may very well find the <dq>gross<dq> feeling to abate. </p>",

That thing where it tells your personality by imagining a cube, right?<dq> <dq>Yeah!<dq> <dq>Oh do it, it<sq>s fun, I want to see what your cube is.<dq>  And he seemed so relieved and we had this fun conversation and went all around the party talking about this goofy personality imagination game.  So I went home and googled the Cube, and found all of these books about how to pick up women listed in the <dq>Amazon thinks you might also like...<dq> list.  Also a dog training manual.  Several hours of googling later, I now knew that the guy who wrote The Game advocates using The Cube to pick up chicks, that<sq>s definitely what he was doing, the fact that he was wandering around doing contact juggling was definitely some combination of peacocking and demonstrating value, and when he kept awkwardly touching me for reason that<sq>s called escalating kino and this is so weird omg I love it let me read all about this weird and kinda gross and fascinating subculture in my spare time.<br><br>So a year or two later, I was single, and at my office company picnic.  My boss and I were getting ready to leave and she had to run into the bathroom.  While I was waiting for her outside, I saw these dudes that worked at the gemstone panning booth gathered around a tent pole trying to do a human flag unsuccessfully.  I had just been working on the trick in pole class, and pointed out to them an easier modified version of the trick that you can do as you work up to it.  Then some dude noticed I was wearing the same weird Vibram 5 finger shoes as him, I gave him a foot-high-5, then he asked me to do a sexy pole trick.  I told him I don<sq>t do sexy pole tricks, but I flipped upside down on the pole and did some crunches hanging by my feet.  Then my boss showed up, I waved goodbye, and we left.  On the way out, he chased me down in her car waving a cell phone.  And I thought <dq>Oh shit, I must have dropped my phone out of my pocket when I was upside down<dq> but it turned out no, it was his cell phone.    He wanted my number.  I gave it to him.  He kissed me on the cheek.  We left.<br><br>We texted a few times, and I started to notice something was up.  Like, he couldn<sq>t have a normal conversation with me, instead it was like he was trying to impress me with how witty he is.  So I<sq>m thinking <dq>Oh geez, this guy sounds like he<sq>s trying to game me.<dq>  Like here and there things he said were coming off as someone trying to be <dq>cocky funny<dq>.        So I decided to play it like a game too to see where it went.  He tried to ask me what I was wearing.  I answered a Boba Fett mask, Hazmat suit, and roller skates.  He asked me what a nice girl like me was doing in pole classes.  I answered <dq>Why, you looking to take some?  My studio is really good.<dq>  He asked me what I did, telling me that he was a Bic Lighter repairman.  I googled that and confirmed that it was a line directly from the internet.<br><br>I was not looking for a serious relationship, and this guy was cute and fun to hang out with, so I figured, why not.  Let<sq>s see what happens if I try to go on a date with this guy.<br><br>And I swear to god, it was the funnest date of my life.  Just trying to fuck with this guy, it was like verbal fencing.  He<sq>d be talking about how important it is to try to be Alpha, and I<sq>d mention that study I read about how ideas relating to Alpha males in wolf packs were based on bad studies from the 1940<sq>s where people were too scared to get close to wolves, and now nowadays, the predominant belief is that wolf packs are nuclear families and <dq>Alpha wolves<dq> are actually just good fathers.  He<sq>d call me a <dq>clever girl<dq> and I<sq>d say <dq>Yeah I can open doors and everything, you condescending prick.<dq>  It was just like this verbal conversational sparring that was a ton of fun.<br><br>Like, if you are just looking for some random casual sex, and are willing to put up with some just like overpowering waves of insecurity and shitty opinions about women, I can not think of a better person to go on a date with than a good PUA, because 90<percent> of what they think about is just how to take somebody on a really good date.  We<sq>d go on this walk in the woods, and then we<sq>d make dinner together, and because he wants to have sex later, he<sq>s like <dq>let<sq>s make a chicken caesar salad<dq> so we weren<sq>t feeling like fat and gross.  He<sq>s got a huge box of backup toothbrushes, and individually wrapped toiletries, because he wants me to be comfortable.  And seriously just like a huge box of oversized sweatshirts so he can give one to me as a <dq>souvenir<dq>.  It was weird as hell, but also a lot of fun.  Like, I<sq>ve never in my life dated somebody who tried that hard to entertain me, and he was genuinely entertaining.<br><br>On a later date, I invited him to a murder mystery party at my house.  He was looking through my bookshelf and found my copy of The Game, and he looked at my roommate and was like <dq>Hey dude, is this yours?<dq> and I just casually was like <dq>Nope!  That<sq>s mine!<dq> and he said <dq>Did you read it?<dq> and I was like <dq>Yeah!  I did!  But I don<sq>t think that book is where it tells you to tell your date you<sq>re a Bic lighter repairman, where<sq>d you get that one?<dq>  And we spent the next several hours just talking about <dq>OMG, so when you said you were wearing a Boba Fett mask, you knew I was compliance testing you<dq> and going over every conversation we ever had.  It was seriously funny.<br><br>I dunno, definitely a weird few weeks of my life, but I really feel like it gave me some interesting insight into, just, awkward dating people in general.  It was really neat.</p>",

Personally, over the last year or so before calling it off, I found myself feeling much less of a desire to be intimate with him and thinking more about dating other people. We still got along great but I wanted our idealistic future we had planned for ourselves rather than wanting to be with him now. <br><br>Ultimately, after doing some long distance while I did a study abroad and having some many rough months, I got to a point where we hadn<sq>t seen each other in a week because of our busy schedules and I realized that I didn<sq>t really miss him.

I don<sq>t look at other people and wonder what it would be like to be with somebody.

                "answer": "<p>A friend of mine from high school was getting married to her first ever boyfriend who I knew was kind of a douche, but whatever, we were going to support a friend.<br><br>She invited all of us to her wedding by creating a Facebook invite. The event page ended up becoming basically a place for the groom to post information about the wedding such as<colon><br><br>1. Only family will be invited to dinner, here are some restaurants in shit box town that you can try instead!<br><br>2. We are charging $2 per drink for dinner guests. We will be increasing the drink price during the reception for those of you not invited to the dinner but are going to the reception.<br><br>3. (After outcry from the previous rule) We don<sq>t want anyone drinking too much or making any bad decisions, so that is why we are increasing the drink price. We also need the extra money to fund the midnight lunch.<br><br>I was pissed off about the drink thing (probably a bit more than I should have been) for many reasons. My friends and I weren<sq>t invited to the dinner since we weren<sq>t family, the wedding was also very far away and required all of us to spend two nights in a hotel, and when the couple did actually send out their invitations (a month before the wedding) they included a gift registry even though we had to pay for hotels and our own meal and drinks.<br><br>I sent the groom a Facebook message regarding the drink prices because I used to be an event planner and I know the laws around liquor permits. In our province it is illegal to charge anymore than $2 unless it is a fundraiser or something. I sent a very civil, polite message informing him of this and this and the reply was this exact message<colon><br><br><dq>Lol thanks for the advice. I<sq>m well aware of drink permits, so be at ease we are fine. By technicality I am the head of a not for profit organization so we have a little more liberty.<dq><br><br>I responded<colon><br><br><dq>So this wedding is serving as a fundraiser for your not-for-profit organization? Will I be given a tax receipt for the gift I give you and drink purchases?<dq><br><br>He did not respond.<br><br>When we finally got to the wedding which was in the middle of nowhere, we sat through a 2.5 hour church service, followed by a long break while the family ate supper. We arrived at the reception to find out that it was literally ONLY the bride<sq>s friends who weren<sq>t invited, so no, it wasn<sq>t a family affair after all. The speeches went on and on about how the bride is so tiny and the groom was a football player in high school so he is really big. ISN<sq>T THAT SO FUNNY?! Many of my guy friends at the end said <dq>I<sq>m kind of sick about hearing how big and strong the groom is<dq>. It was definitely <dq>the groom show<dq> and not <dq>the couple show<dq>.<br><br>They also each had one mentally handicapped person in their wedding parties. When they were thanking their brides and groomsmen, the groom<sq>s voice started to quiver as he introduced the handicapped individuals. He said something along the lines of <dq>we have a junior bridesmaid and groomsman up here have had a really tough time in their lives...<dq> then he burst out sobbing and said <dq>and we are just so happy to have them with us today.<dq> The way he said the speech made it sound like they were patting themselves on the back for being nice and tolerant and <dq>letting the handicaps be in the wedding party<dq>. They also couldn<sq>t really be considered junior brides/groomsmen because they were a lot older than the couple getting married, so it didn<sq>t make sense.<br><br>After the speeches, there was a <dq>bride dance<dq> and a <dq>groom dance<dq> where guests have a chance to take the couple for <dq>one last spin<dq> or whatever. Before the bride dance started, the groom got on stage and said <dq>Okay everyone, I<sq>m going to allow you to dance with my wife. However, I will ask that if you dance with her that you make a donation to buying our first house,<dq> so all the guests had to pay money to dance with the bride. <br><br>The groom dance was to <dq>I<sq>m Too Sexy<dq> by Right Said Fred. The groom was not in the best shape and he also isn<sq>t the most attractive fellow, but he proceeded to strip off his clothes and get on stage in just his suspenders and dress pants as the guests quietly hurled.<br><br>Apparently later on in the night they passed a shoe around to get more donations,.<br><br><br>It was a pretty bad wedding. <br></p>",

Adults spend more time teaching and reinforcing <dq>correct<dq> social behavior with girls.  If a boy is eccentric, it<sq>s more likely to be written off than called out.  <br><br>Some forms of autistic behavior- like being off in one<sq>s own world, in a fog- goes unnoticed by adults because little girls are expected to be quiet and placid.  A shy girl is just that.  A shy boy is encouraged to be more boisterous.  <br><br>Most little girls are socialized to be indirect about their feelings, to couch their emotions in coded terms, passive-aggressive behaviors, etc.  Whereas the autistic brain is literal to a fault.  So autistic girls may not easily pick up on the fact that their female peers are mocking them, or attempting to shut them out.  From a distance, this can look like the autistic girl is enjoying more social success than she really is.<br><br>Autistic girls<sq> special interests also tend to be a little more <dq>socially acceptable<dq> than the stereotypical special interests of an autistic boy.  Nobody really bats an eye at a thirteen-year-old girl becoming obsessed with her favorite band.  The fact that she<sq>s literally memorized every interview they<sq>ve given and can quote their entire concert schedule from memory is taken as <dq>extra enthusiasm<dq>, not signs of a mental disorder.<br><br>All of this (and more) contributes to autistic girls and women being massively underdiagnosed.  <br><br>Living with an undiagnosed mental disorder is a life where you feel an omnipresent sense of failure and lack of connection without knowing why.  It<sq>s being constantly exhausted by things other people seem to manage with only minor effort.  It<sq>s being 30 years old and berating yourself for having a <dq>tantrum<dq> (autistic meltdown).  It<sq>s blaming yourself for a problem that lies in your neurology- writing off a serious disorder as a character flaw, something you can fix with willpower.  Only no matter how hard you try, you never quite get there.  <br><br>Given that autistic weaknesses are almost a word-for-word match with what are heralded as women<sq>s strengths, or even just basic expectations for women, you have a recipe for self-loathing.  For never achieving one<sq>s full potential or even a base level of happiness.

There was much joking about my being <dq>old<dq> with friend and family. No one I knew really thought I was old.  I had no issues during pregnancy (I do know that<sq>s not the case for all, but I had an easy go of it).  My first was 4 weeks early, my second was 2 weeks early and anecdotally, they both arrived the day after I told them they could come whenever they wanted.  I love having babies, I love the little people they are learning to be.  It<sq>s exhausting and there are days when I<sq>d give anything for a hot bath and a massage.  My body at 39 isn<sq>t the same as it was at 20 and I don<sq>t bounce back quite as fast, but it<sq>s so fun.  This joy is added to by the fact that my hubs is an amazing dad. God bless single moms and dads out there because I would not be able to cope with 24/7 no breaks/no help.  Hubs is my salvation when I<sq>ve gotten locked into a power-struggle with the 2 year old.  He<sq>s in it and dives in and helps and it<sq>s... hot. <br><br>I should add, I do my level best not to paddle the toddler when he looks me in the eye and drops food on the floor for the dog.  Again.   The testing boundaries is hard. It<sq>s not all sunshine and roses.<br><br>Hope that helps!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As someone who has moved a fair bit I<sq>ve become quite proactive about making friends. I have a number of friends that I absolutely adore and who I would do anything for and they would do anything for me. Some I see regularly, some we might not see each other for months or longer but when we do it<sq>s like we were never apart except that there<sq>s so much to catch up on! <br><br>What I found works for me is<colon><br><br>* Figure out who interests me and why (I like a mix - people like me and people different from me). <br>* Assume that if they interest me there<sq>s a good chance that I might interest them. Proceed with the following as if it<sq>s going to be well-received, unless there is solid evidence that it is not (in other words, have confidence!). <br>* Put myself into situations where we<sq>re in close proximity and it would be natural and easy to acknowledge each other and chat a bit. Ask / talk to them about things relevant to the situation. <br>* If that goes well, either that time or another time ask / chat about interests. <br>* Keep conversations positive but real and show my genuine interest by listening to what they say and having relevant comments / questions. <br>* After a few such chats, I would suggest doing something either more advanced within the context we know each other (like studying for a test if at uni together) or that takes us outside of that context - sometimes it<sq>s as simple as something practical like grabbing lunch together, other times it<sq>s a shared interest, like taking photos of a particular place/event, or going for a walk/run together, etc.  <br>* If ever they invite me someplace, do whatever I can to make it possible to attend. If I can<sq>t attend, though, be up front about it and counter-offer by inviting them to something they<sq>d enjoy (so they know that my not coming was not out of lack of interest). <br>* If occasional catch-ups go well, do more - maybe even suggest a regular / semi-regular catch up (weekly walk/run, monthly photo catch-up with a few other enthusiasts). <br>* Once you<sq>ve chatted and hung out a few times, ask their opinion on things from time to time - it could be an outfit for a big occasion, or a situation you<sq>re trying to figure out how to handle. Asking for someone<sq>s opinion signals that you trust and respect them.<br>* There are also things like keeping in touch via text / FB / other social media as appropriate. People really notice and appreciate if you remember that they<sq>ve got something big happening and you send them a <dq>Hope it goes well<dq> or <dq>How did it go?<dq> kind of message on the day. <br>* Research shows that people like someone more after they<sq>ve helped them. The simple act of helping someone signals to the helper that they must like the person to have bothered to help them. So, if you need a lift, ask that new friend and it might make her like you more! Obviously don<sq>t ask for anything crazy big, but small things (no money!) is fine. Likewise, offer to help them if they could use help. Several friendships have been formed over helping someone move house, for instance. <br><br>In summary<colon> assume that they will want to be your friend, and treat them as you would treat a friend you<sq>re getting to know - ask questions, be interested, be real, suggest activities, be helpful and accept help as needed. <br><br>Also...at some point down the track once I<sq>ve actually become friends with someone and we<sq>re regularly hanging out I let them know that I specifically chose them as a friend and was intentional about getting to know them because I liked something about them. If they<sq>re what I call <sq>lifers<sq> I tell them that, too<colon> that they<sq>re someone I hope I know for life, and that even if circumstances change and mean we don<sq>t get to see each other regularly that it won<sq>t ever be because I<sq>ve lost interest in them - just that our lives might take us in different directions, and that<sq>s fine but I hope that whenever we can catch up that it will be real and totally us. <br><br>I<sq>ve found that the friends I<sq>ve spoken to specifically about our friendship have responded well to that. It avoids so many of those awkward situations down the track when we do see each other less regularly, because we always expected that to happen and don<sq>t mistakenly presume it was because the other was no longer interested. Which means we do still feel free to call each other up after six months or more and say, <dq>Let<sq>s catch up!<dq> <br><br>Edit<colon> formatting!</p>",

We clicked immediately, even moreso than me and my ex which I never thought would be possible, and he blew my ex out of the water. He was smarter, more attractive, funnier, more charming, sweeter, sexier, better in bed... and best of all, he wanted me just as much as I wanted him. We fell in love and we<sq>ve never looked back. Now that I<sq>m with a guy who truly wants me and treats me like something precious that he never wants to lose, I could never go back to dating someone like my ex. When I look back at that time in my life, I laugh. I thought I would never find anyone better than Aidan, but in reality I just had to let go of him and let real love come to me.<br><br>You<sq>ll be okay. I know it<sq>s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel right now, but you<sq>ll get there. It takes time. Don<sq>t give up hope! Put the dating on pause and give yourself time to realize that this isn<sq>t the end of your love life and that you *can* find someone better. <br><br>Good luck with everything <colon>)</p>",

You<sq>ll never regret the work you put in to better yourself.<br><br>That being said, last night I went on an incredible first date.

We talked everyday for hours and this lasted for years. I flew out to spend time with him in my early twenties. <br><br>I thought things would change for us. One of us would move so we could be with each other. By 22, I realized it was a pipe dream. I started dating another man, we broke up after 6 months. <br><br>Then I went through a period where I dated or fucked anyone who showed the slightest bit of interest. That really wasn<sq>t good for my self esteem. <br><br>I took a break from dating for about a year or so. When I was ready, I put up a dating profile on plenty of fish and met my eventual husband there. We<sq>ve been together for 5 years and I fall in love with him again every day. <br><br>But from 22 to 26 it was a pretty bleak time for me.  Life doesn<sq>t always turn out the way we expect it to, but it can end up being better than what we ever expected for ourselves. <br><br>Take the time for your heart to heal. Spend time with friends or family- just people that make you feel good. Or find some kind of organized activity to do. You don<sq>t have to jump back on dating wagon right away. Life can be enjoyable when you are single too! </p>",

                "answer": "<p>This is a pet theory of mine, actually. <br><br> I think there are people who legitimately like opposite sex friends (Group A) and there are people who really only have same-sex friends but have opposite sex <dq>friends<dq> around to be potential sex partners (Group B). Just for the LGBT kids let me say this; I could reword this to include y<sq>all but it made my head spin trying to get the words right but know that I was thinking about you in here as well. <br><br>So here<sq>s where the problem happens. <br><br>* Girl (Group A) meets Boy (Group B)<colon> All men are just friends with women so they can sleep with them<br>* Girl (Group B) meets Boy (Group B)<colon> Come on....don<sq>t we ALL know that opposite sex <dq>friends<dq> are just waiting to bang?<br>* Girl (Group B) meets Boy (Group A)<colon> Dude...what do you MEAN you just want to be friends with her? Is she ugly? Don<sq>t you find her attractive? Weren<sq>t you leading her on all this time cause why else would you ever want to spend time with a girl? <br>* Girl (Group A) meets Boy (Group A)<colon> Why the hell does no one believe that we<sq>re just buddies? Why is everyone so stereotypical and jaded? <br><br>Well, the reason that the last scenario is so difficult to believe is that it is only holding about a 25<percent> market share. That number might even be way, way off if you take into account that there may indeed be way more Group B people running around. And, hey, let<sq>s take ages into consideration. In high school or college, before anyone has standards/practice dating/controlled libidos/the good sense to keep it together there are way, way, way more Group B scenarios. Even when people didn<sq>t *intend* to fall in love with their female friends they do anyway because pickings are slim, crushes happen, and the younger you are the easier it is to overlook characteristics that would disqualify someone as a partner in the future. <br><br>As we grow older, of course, we<sq>re a lot more picky about the kind of people we date. We<sq>ve done a couple of destructive boys/girls and realized that the charm wears off and chaos is all that they leave behind. Maybe we<sq>ve even gone for the nice, sweet, simple person without any sexual chemistry once or twice and now we know better than to settle for someone that doesn<sq>t click with us. We<sq>re far more likely to take those people (with all that practical experience in mind) and relegate them to friends; <dq>Gee, I really like you as a human being but I would **never** date/sleep with you....wanna go to a movie?<dq><br><br>Lastly, there are communication issues here. When a 35 year old woman looks at a man and says that she doesn<sq>t feel anything for him romantically and they should be friends, we<sq>re all FAR more likely to take that seriously. That is NOT to say there isn<sq>t game playing and lying at any age, but I am more likely to trust someone older with more experience to know her own heart and be able to pro-actively communicate boundaries. Young people who are still scared *shitless* about even the concept of asking someone out will often couch their feelings in friendship because that<sq>s the safe way to play it. It is, by consequence, also the best way to a one-way friendzone ticket but we all learn that with time (or we should, more accurately). So your words don<sq>t mean much if her friends and your friends are used to people using friendship as a euphemism because you are, in their mind, confirming what they expect<colon> you<sq>re unaware of your romantic feelings or downplaying them because you don<sq>t have the social chutzpah to declare your attraction. <br><br>So OP<colon> they are giving you a hard time because they just don<sq>t get it. They might be naturally Group B kind of people, they might not have the life experience to have come across an attractive person you just don<sq>t *want* in a romantic way, and their life experience so far has told them they are right. They<sq>ve probably seen friend after friend swear that their budding relationship is not worrisome because they are *just friends* only to catch them banging in the pool house the next week. Maybe there<sq>s some internal mechanism by which they once THOUGHT it was going to be a friendship only to have feelings develop on one or both sides of the coin. <br><br>So....just relax. Time will help a lot because people will, given enough time, start to believe you and chill out about it. Time will also help inasmuch as this won<sq>t be a problem as you get older and more mature. Sorry people are dumping on you, but they aren<sq>t doing it to be assholes, they just don<sq>t know any better. Best of luck!<br><br>**Edit**<colon> Wow, what a great response. One thing though....I KNOW the math is wrong. It wasn<sq>t meant to be real math in the slightest. I couldn<sq>t even do the real math had I the inclination and, even so, I imagine it to be impossible to measure. I used percentages rhetorically, not with any intention of accuracy. </p>",

I get what you mean about not being able to relate to cat calls or sexual harassment. I<sq>m always invisible. It would be nice to be noticed, even in a way that is not wanted because then at least I would feel wanted. I realized that either I would be focused on my looks, something that I can choose to change drastically (go to the gym, get plastic surgery, clothing, etc) or just accept this is who I am.<br><br>There<sq>s no point in wasting my time being upset about being invisible to boys. There<sq>s no point in it because it<sq>s going to happen until eventually maybe one day it will not...

I do a lot of cool things - I<sq>ve met an Oscar nominated director, been to a party with YouTubers, gone ice climbing in Iceland, Sky dived in Hawaii, built a community centre in Nicaragua... I<sq>ve found meaning in my life that is beyond my appearance, beyond needing to feel like I should be attractive. <br><br>Instead, I<sq>ve found comfort in my mind, my sense of self... If you can<sq>t be one of the most attractive people in the room, why can<sq>t you be one of the most interesting? Or funny? Or exciting? Or pleasant? Or whatever you want? Placing value on something that will not matter in the long run is never going to make you happy. You<sq>re never going to be more attractive than everybody in the entire world, you<sq>re never going to be good enough if you<sq>re unhappy with yourself. Find things that make you feel good about yourself. Place value in those things. Don<sq>t place value in feeling less attractive. That feeling won<sq>t go away because even people who are insanely attractive will feel like they<sq>re unattractive in comparison to someone else. <br><br>If you learn to place less importance on your appearance, on comparing yourself, on other people<sq>s appearance, you learn to be more comfortable in your own skin. I know what I look like. I know what my body looks like. It doesn<sq>t have to hurt me or bother me anymore than I let it. I know that I won<sq>t get hit on at a bar. I know I won<sq>t have a guy come up to me on the street and tell me I<sq>m gorgeous. I know that dating is really difficult for me. But once people get to know me, they genuinely like me for who I am. <br><br>Next time I<sq>m at a bar and my hot friend gets hit on and I get ignored, I can either get hurt that once again, I am not attractive enough to be noticed, or I can just move on... I don<sq>t need to be attractive to be successful or happy. I shouldn<sq>t be looking for external validation to be okay with myself.

While living alone, have periodic check-ins with someone like a friend or a relative. If you haven<sq>t checked in a week and they can<sq>t get ahold of you, they should call your local police to do a wellness check. Make sure you give them the information you need.<br>4. If you can, replace your key lock with a pin-number lock. That way, you don<sq>t have to worry about losing keys or having a hidden spare around where a savvy burglar might find it. <br>5. If you can, get a dog. Make sure you research a breed appropriate for your living situation (don<sq>t get a husky if you live in a small apartment and aren<sq>t going to be active.) Even a chiwawa makes an excellent alert dog. <br>6. Don<sq>t worry about having the best stuff at first. Try to get the basics you need cheaply and have them be as multi-use as possible. Replace them later as you can. (When my BF and I first moved in together, we were leaving the Army so we had no furniture. We bought a couch that folds out into a bed from a thrift store. It wasn<sq>t ideal, but it held us over until we could afford to upgrade, which allowed us to buy pots and pans.)<br>7. As for buying stuff, get only what you absolutely need to begin with. It<sq>s easy to get excited and buy every little thing for a house, but start it slow. <br>8. DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR FOR VISITORS UNLESS YOU CONFIRM WHO THEY ARE FIRST! Don<sq>t just open it for anyone who knocks. Sometimes you might be tempted to open the door without looking, especially if you were expecting someone. DON<sq>T TO THAT! Also, sometimes a burglar will find some way to pretend to be a repairman or work for the city. Neither will arrive without an appointment. If they insist the city sent them, get their name and their boss<sq> info and confirm it by phone and DON<sq>T ANSWER THE DOOR UNTIL YOU<sq>RE ABSOLUTLEY SURE! Even then, you can tell them to come back later (when you have someone else with you.) <br>9. Do not let strangers know that you live alone. <br>10. If you have a feminine-sounding name, make sure that name is not on your mailbox. First names are almost never on mailboxes unless a person lives alone (See #9) and your name would reveal that you are a woman living alone. <br>11. Pick up your mail and any newspapers. Don<sq>t let them pile up. Doing that makes burglars think your home is empty and an easy target. If you go on vacation, make sure someone else picks up your mail for this reason. <br>12. If your neighbors start giving you trouble, even a little bit, DOCUMENT IT! Write it down in a journal with names, dates, times, and exactly what happened. Even if it seems minor or like a one-time thing. It<sq>s unlikely anything like that will happen at all, or that it will escalate if it does. But if it *does* escalate, and that neighbor becomes a huge problem, you want as much documentation going as far back as possible. Sometimes people really do run into <dq>neighbors from hell<dq> situations. They<sq>re unlikely, but you want to be prepared. </p>",

And it was just really really nice to have him come and watch movies and treat me like a human being even thought i smelt and resembled  trash and I couldn<sq>t talk. <br>- Having someone to remind you about social events and stuff you need to do. I<sq>d like to think I<sq>m organised, but shit slips through the cracks, so talking to him and being like <dq>oh fuck yeah that<sq>s on tuesday<dq><br>- Having someone to teach you shit. I cannot for the life of me understand any plumbing, electrics, auto or building processes or quick fixes or anything. Having someone close to leap in and show, encourage, teach and then not charge you is nice. Especially in emergency situations. <br>- It becomes someone elses joint responsiblity to buy the tooth paste and the toilet paper. And so there<sq>s a chance it<sq>ll be done sooner or not forgotten about. Sad part is that 2 people means you need twice as much. <br>- It<sq>s just nice having the little bits of affection. Just the hair stroke there, and the hand hold here. <br>- Having someone to use as an excuse. Having a partner makes it way easier to leave shitty events. Similarly if you<sq>re sick about talking about you and what you<sq>re doing, talk about them! It<sq>s not as relevant so whoever you<sq>re talking to thats asking the blandest questions will lose interest faster and bada-bing you<sq>re out of that conversation.  <br>- They know how to call you on you being a fuck wit. Yeah, you are wrong sometimes. Having someone who knows you so they ask those questions that make you pause and go <dq>yeah fuck I need to not do/be/say xyz<dq>. I LOVE love love my boyfriends ability to call me on stuff in a way that is supportive and means that I do actually alter what I<sq>m doing. <br>- Having someone to be silent with. To be calm. <br>- I love having such faith and pride in someone. It<sq>s really nice to find someone to cherish and to have that feeling of <dq>HEY LOOK AT THIS GUY THIS GUY IS AMAZING<dq>. I find it really refreshing for my empathy and my belief in others outside of him. I can be kind of cynical, and he is naively moralistic and ethical. His pure faith in that others wanting to good gives me faith that maybe they actually do. If he<sq>s so wonderful, imagine all the other people out there who are just so fucking brilliant. That twist of outlook can sometimes cause friction, but it<sq>s so wonderful being able to know someone so well you can really slip into their worldview. <br>- Making couple friends. I feel like that way I don<sq>t overload single friends with grossness. I really like that, up until someone splits. <br>- Having like, double the reason to celebrate anything. He got a job interview? WOOO!! I got a job interview? WOOO!! Any good news becomes like especially good news because he<sq>s there as my hype man. He just hypes me. And I hype him</p>",

In the books, some other girl\u2014who has never been a show character\u2014was raped. Sansa was randomly given this girl<sq>s rape storyline simply because, well, why not show even more torturing-women-porn on GoT, eh? I know the show is brutal and savage. No doubt. But it<sq>s like the writers get off on inflicting as much pain as possible onto the female characters. <br><br>Second of all, her rape ended up being not even about her but about how much it hurt *Theon*. She wasn<sq>t even given the dignity of us seeing how it affected HER as it happened, oh no\u2014the camera panned over to Theon<sq>s horrified eyes. Because lord knows Theon<sq>s manpain following Sansa<sq>s rape is more important than actually focusing on how it affected Sansa, right? \ud83d\ude44<br><br>RUNNER-UP<colon> how Jaime raped Cersei. Not only was it, again, *wholly* unnecessary because Jaime Lannister is not a rapist\u2014in fact, he mentions several times in the books how he wouldn<sq>t force himself upon a woman\u2014but it was also glossed over after, as if all he did was give her an innocent neck massage...versus raping her. But, ya know. Gotta get that rape in for shock value. \ud83d\ude12<br><br>SECOND RUNNER-UP<colon> how Drogo raped Dany. The whole point of their relationship being amazing in the books was that *Drogo didn<sq>t force her*. In the show? Nah. He just took her by force while she cried and said <dq>No.<dq> And yet, she still fell in love with him after and the rape was never addressed.<br><br>Uh, I think you guys can see a pattern with GoT here. And one can<sq>t even blame it on <dq>Well, it<sq>s a brutal world!<dq> because GRRM handled things way better in the actual books. It<sq>s just the show which seems to live to show women being abused.<br><br>**EDIT**<colon> Okay, I just remembered another that appalled me. In Shameless, when Sheila and Frank first start living together, she ties him up to her bed and uses her sex toys on him while he yells and screams, <dq>NOOOO!<dq> I understand we<sq>re supposed to hate Frank and like Sheila and therefore the scene was supposed to come off as comedic\u2014but it didn<sq>t to me. Because as much of a scumbag as Frank is, he didn<sq>t deserve to get raped. And that *was* rape; Sheila never waited for him to acually consent to her doing that. It always makes me feel really uncomfortable that the show totally ignored that (I<sq>m on season 4 now so no spoilers please!).</p>",

My boobs didn<sq>t really develop until I was 15 or so, and even now I<sq>m not very full-chested, (although I<sq>m very happy with what I have). So for several years in my teens, I was desperately wishing I had cleavage to show off, because I thought it looked really sexy and would make me more attractive to guys. I wished that guys would notice me because of my looks, because I<sq>d never really experienced that before. <br><br>So, now that I actually have some amount of cleavage and a much better self-esteem, it makes me feel extremely sexy to be able to show off my chest a bit. The idea that guys are looking at me and find me attractive is a huge confidence-builder for me. I guess it sort of feels to me like <dq>making up<dq> for the looks I never got in my earlier teens. <br><br>Note<colon> I don<sq>t dress outrageously or in an <dq>attention-seeking<dq> way by any means--my boyfriend says my style is even more conservative than most. But when I do wear a shirt that happens to have some cleavage, (though never anything extreme), it makes me feel especially attractive, knowing that guys are looking at me. <br><br>It<sq>s probably also fair to add that my sexual preferences play into this somewhat. I have a lot of exhibitionist fantasies, and I love being my boyfriend<sq>s <dq>little slut,<dq>  as he calls me. I<sq>m guessing that has something to do with enjoying the idea of guys staring at me; the concept that they find me attractive, but that my boyfriend is the only one who gets to have me, is personally very exciting for me. So...in retrospect then, maybe I<sq>m not showing cleavage so much for men, but rather for myself? I guess there<sq>s a bit of a grey area there. <br><br>Also<colon> I don<sq>t mean to invalidate anyone else<sq>s feelings on the subject. I think it<sq>s really wonderful that women feel that they<sq>re able to dress the way they want, without feeling the need to cater to men. These are just my personal experiences and preferences; I completely understand if they are not shared.<br><br>**EDIT<colon>** This has got me thinking a bit; the overwhelming response ITT seems to be <dq>no, I don<sq>t want men to look,<dq> and so far, mine is the only comment I<sq>ve seen that doesn<sq>t seem to share this opinion.

I think people just show love in different ways and you have to be willing to accept them for that, or find someone who loves you in the way you want to be loved.  <br><br>My current partner once said it to me in the middle of a fight.  It stung, a lot, but I just keep trying to help him see that I do love him.  What he was missing was the ways that I was showing him I loved him, he just didn<sq>t know about them.  He doesn<sq>t drink (at all) and isn<sq>t a big partier.  That<sq>s fine, those are neither good nor bad qualities.  However, I both drink AND when my friends go out it tends to turn into a HUGE affair quite often(there<sq>s a lot of us and we can get rowdy).  We also would go out at least every weekend, and frequently more often during the week.<br><br>When my SO and I started dating, I recognized that he wasn<sq>t comfortable with the huge crowds I hung with so I changed my plans to be with him.  I turned down more invitations to go out (still going out with friends when he wasn<sq>t around), and we would find things that we both enjoyed doing.  I don<sq>t normally drink when I<sq>m with him, and when we do meet up with my friends we try to make it smaller affairs (sometimes that works). <br><br>He<sq>s also allergic to poultry, which is what the vast majority of the protein portion of my diet has always relied on.  So, I found new recipes that I could cook for him that included pork, seafood, and other beef sources.  I will go with him to events that mean something to him to support him.  Since we<sq>re somewhat long distance, on the weekends that we DO get to be together I essentially set aside everything else I need to do and make sure I focus all my time on him.<br><br>The problem is, a lot of that can go unnoticed and without a lot of fanfare.  It<sq>s simple changes that you can forget because its just about making life a little more comfortable and easier.  I don<sq>t bring it up, and I don<sq>t expect praise for it, but its my ways of showing that I care for him.  I do big things too - I planned and payed for most of a vacation last winter, I<sq>ve surprised him with trips out of town and gifts I know he<sq>d like, etc.  But the little things, the day to day things, are the ones that mean the most to me.  <br><br>On the other hand, I<sq>m a pretty independent person who<sq>s in a challenging graduate school program.  I bust my rear every day at school, and there are times where I simply have to study instead of spending time with him.  I don<sq>t particularly like talking on the phone (never have, I find it boring), though I will because I know he appreciates it.  And sometimes, I just need some alone time because I need to reset myself before someone crawls up my ass again.  I am not particularly externally expressive in ANY emotion, and when I<sq>m upset I<sq>m very reserved.  I don<sq>t really show it, and especially not to the person who hurt me or made me upset.  So I think people tend to judge those qualities as me being aloof, disinterested and disconnected instead of just being a reserved person.  I think, more than anything else, those qualities can cause people to believe that they love me more than I love them because they<sq>re easier to observe.<br><br>I guess my whole point is, don<sq>t assume that you care for someone more than they care for you.  There<sq>s a quote that says <dq>Just because someone doesn<sq>t love you the way you think they should, doesn<sq>t mean they don<sq>t love you with everything they have<dq>.  Sometimes people are showing you that they DO love you, and its just not what you expect so you miss it.<br><br>As a caveat - if your partner is hitting you, making you feel bad about yourself, raping you, or doing anything harmful to you mentally, physically, or emotionally, then they do not love you and you should leave.  I<sq>m only talking about people who are not outwardly expressive with their love all the time.</p>",

Doesn<sq>t have to be a fancy blow dry, just get it completely dry.  While you<sq>re blow drying your hair, turn on the curling wand to let it heat up.<br><br>Step three<colon> use clips to section off your hair.  I usually curl it in 6 sections (but my hair is fine); bottom right, bottom left, middle  right, middle left, top right, top left.  BUT, I let the three main sections (bottom, middle, top) down one at a time.  <br><br>Step four<colon> Begin curling the bottom third of your hair first.  Turn the curling wand upside down (tapered side should be pointing at your shoulder; cord side should be up in the air pointing at the ceiling).  Pick a small-ish (1<dq> or so) section of hair, and wrap it *away from your face* around the wand.  Repeat until one half of the bottom section of your hair is curled.  When you do the other half of the bottom (depending on if you start with left or right), then repeat this process - just switch hands, turn curling rod upside down, and again, curl the hair in the opposite direction of your face.<br><br>Step five<colon> repeat step four with the middle section, and then finally with the top section of your hair.  <br><br>Step six<colon> examine hair (especially back) to see if you missed any parts, and curl as necessary.  <br><br>Step seven<colon> do your makeup or something until your hair completely cools (I usually let the curls set for about 15 minutes or so).  Lightly spray with a very light hair spray and then use a wide tooth comb to comb it out a bit - this will give some volume and make your hair feel touchably soft and manageable.  <br><br>Step eight<colon> Take a very small top section of your hair and pin it back with bobby pins.  <br><br>It takes a bit to get the hang of it, so try it at home when you don<sq>t necessarily have to go anywhere.

If you<sq>re coordinated enough to flat iron your hair, you should be fine.  <br><br>Also, have you checked out any of the tutorials on how to use a flat iron to curl your hair?

It<sq>s like having a world all unto your own.<br><br>3)When my SO says nice things to me that really let me know what<sq>s going on emotionally.

It\u2019s 70/30 or 90/10 or 20/80, and sometimes it\u2019s just plain 100/0.  Rarely will you ever have a situation where a perfect 50/50 compromise is possible.  The hard part is accepting that sometimes you just have to give in, even if sometimes it infuriates you to do so.

It takes a lot of warming up, foreplay and lubricant (I recommend popping a couple vitamin e capsules and using coconut oil).  A glass of red wine or a fat doobie will get you where you need to be; relaxed.<br><br>Now, the difference between PIV sex and anal is as comparable as apples and oranges.  Extremely different.  Anal is obviously much tighter and fuller feeling.  Again, when done properly, you won<sq>t feel like you<sq>re taking a dump.  Ideally the two anal muscles are relaxed allowing your partner or dildo to penetrate with ease.  <br><br>The best positions for anal are all of them.  However, starting out, it<sq>s best if you lay on your tummy with a pillow beneath your pelvic area.  Starting out slow is must, no matter how seasoned you are.  Before taking it to pound town, your muscles need to be relaxed, your mind needs to be relaxed as does the rest of your body; no tension, anywhere.   The penetrator should always point his member toward the vagina; this way you are getting vaginal stimulation simultaneously.  <br><br>My boyfriend is huge.  I was in fear of letting him in through the back door and we had many tries and failed attempts before we were able to make it happen.  For him, he can penetrate me deeper since there<sq>s no cervix stopping him and ironically, I don<sq>t tear anally as I do sometimes vaginally.  I really enjoy anal especially since it isn<sq>t always guaranteed that I have a PIV orgasm, but I always cum from anal.  Anal orgasms for me are explosive!  My body goes limp and I have this euphoric-orgasmic tingle throughout - even my nipples tingle!  If I could, I would have anal sex daily.  But I can<sq>t, so I wear a butt plug during sex to make up for it (\u0e51\u275b\u06a1\u275b\u0e51)\u2606</p>",
