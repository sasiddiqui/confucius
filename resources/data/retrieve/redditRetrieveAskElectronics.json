AM transmits at around 1 MHz or so, which has a wavelength of around 300 meters.  <br><br>When you want to receive a radio signal, typically you want an antenna that is similar in size to the wavelength of the signal you<sq>re trying to receive.  This is so that the oscillating electric field of the incoming wave will impose the largest possible potential difference (voltage) between the ends of the antenna.  1/4 wave or 1/2 wave antennas are very common.  For FM, a 1/4 wave antenna would be 0.75 m long, which is quite reasonable.  <br><br>For AM, a 1/4 wave antenna would be about 75 m, which is huge.  AM transmitters are about this big, but it is far too large for convenient reception.  So instead of trying to pick up a potential difference in the electric field, AM receive antennas are built to pick up the oscillating magnetic field that propagates along with the oscillating electric field.  Antennas that are far smaller than the wavelength are not very efficient, but with a small loop antenna you get the advantage of being able to turn it in to a coil where the relatively large number of loops can provide a significant amount of antenna gain (gain goes with the square of the number of loops - i.e. 10 loops provides a gain of 100).  Small pocket AM radios can have hundreds of turns wrapped around a ferrite core for a very compact antenna.  Stereos have more space to work with and will use something on the order of 10 turns or so with a much larger loop area.  <br><br>This <sq>trick<sq> with using a coil for an antenna is not a magic bullet.  It only works for antennas that are much, much smaller than the wavelength.  This applies to both the size of the coil itself as well as the length of wire that it<sq>s made out of.  Small AM radio antennas are less than 1 cm in diameter.  100 turns on a 1cm diameter coil is about 3m of wire.  If the wire is too long, you get phase shift along the wire that completely screws up the antenna performance.  This is why coil antennas are only used for very long wave radio - regular quarter or half wave antennas are far more effective at higher frequencies.  </p>",

HVDC transmission lines are becoming more common now that the conversion can be done with thyristors instead of mercury arc rectifiers.  Of course, they<sq>re still limited to backbone roles, since the end result still needs to be AC in most cases.  <br><br>Their main benefit is that it<sq>s a lot easier to feed power to the grid if you<sq>re just acting as a current source out to a DC bus.  No phase synchronization is needed, nor any frequency conversion.  <br><br>There are some major caveats to DC, though.  <br><br>First, there<sq>s the polarity problem.  At the moment, it<sq>s bad to switch hot and neutral, but it usually won<sq>t cause a great KABOOM from doing so.  If we went to DC, it probably would result in some spectacular failures from miswired outlets and whatnot.  <br><br>Then there<sq>s the breaker problem.  It<sq>s hard to make good DC breakers.  This is because the voltage never goes to zero, and certainly not 100-120 times per second.  So quenching arcs is a problem.  Not insurmountable in a home environment, but a little more difficult when you<sq>re talking 100 kV.  <br><br>The breaker problem is also an issue whenever you go to unplug something in a house.  Most connectors for AC aren<sq>t rated for DC disconnection under load; they<sq>ll just arc over if you disconnect them.

Still makes the transmission lines trickier, though.  <br><br>Incidentally, 50/60 Hz was regarded as too high a frequency around the time it came about.

It might be worth spending $5 extra on components for a $100 circuit, but not for a $5 one.<br><br>There are 4 main things to watch out for though.<br><br>1. Reversed polarity on the power supply. Swapping +ve for -ve will kill many circuits. A diode will work, but is inefficient with both voltage drop and current loss. A p-type mosfet is the best option but is expensive and needs to be matched to your circuit to an extent.<br><br>2. Shorts/Excess Current. A short to ground can cause a fire in some cases. But even an overloaded circuit can either heat components and connectors or kill them outright. Best solution here is a fuse or polyfuse (a fuse that self resets once the problem is cleared. This might not save the chip, but it should stop a fire. Again value needs to be matched to your circuit.<br><br>3. Overvoltage. Not generally a problem, but can be in some setups. The related problem of spikes can be though.A cap on the input power will smooth out any short spikes. While a flyback diode will stop spikes from motors coming back into the control circuit. Sustained overvoltage is best dealt with with a zener diode between +ve and -ve. This should be valued so that it only breaks down when the voltage is too high. At this point it will effectively short to ground and blow the fuse.<br><br>4. Static. This is the pain in the arse when making stuff. Your body can build up a huge static voltage in some situations. Of the order of 10,000V or more. This will fry many components, even if only applied from the fraction of a second of the spark. Best protection is pre-emptive grounding of yourself. Touch a grounded metal object before working on your circuit and give the case a good ground if you can. Also keep components in electrostatic bags until use if you can (particularly transistors, or transistor based stuff.)<br><br>Much of this needs to be tuned to your circuit. If you want any additional help, some more info on what you are protecting will help.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I am not an EE. In fact I<sq>ve struggled with higher math and physics all my life. This has contributed to me being poor, which compounds the problem.<br><br>My father was a mechanical engineer. He could build any circuit he could get a schematic of, and he was in a class of his own when it came to soldering. Never a cold joint. Always heat the part, not the solder. He<sq>s nearly 80 and can still solder better than me.<br><br>Electronics have fascinated me all my life and I struggled to understand it. I also knew that I had disappointed my dad by not picking it up. He may not have had an EE background but I would get completely anxious when I couldn<sq>t figure out how to translate a schematic to a breadboard. I went to my dad for every little thing, until a few years ago.<br><br>Because of the Arduino ecosystem, I got what I needed when it came to soldering - *practice*. There was no reason or justification to practicing prior to that because nothing I built ever worked. And, I mean, simple things, like an adjustable duty-cycle 555 circuit. I grew up with the Forrest Mims books from Radio Shack and the 200-in-1 Electronic Project kits. I could connect the wires to the springs, I could follow those instructions, and I could even experiment with modifying the circuits. But anything else, anything more ambitious, I would fail.<br><br>So you<sq>re probably saying to yourself <dq>well you<sq>re not an EE, you didn<sq>t go to school for it, you didn<sq>t get good grades, but I did, and I paid my dues, so that explains it.<dq> But that also explains why the Arduino stuff is so popular. Now, look, I know that it<sq>s ridiculous on paper to use a 16MHz CPU to blink an LED. And I agree that too much abstraction of the underlying physics takes away from your understanding. I was an early adopter of computers; trust me, I know what it<sq>s like to know DOS intimately and have to deal with people whining they can<sq>t figure out how to double-click a mouse.<br><br>There are a couple of different types of hackers/makers/whatever they<sq>re calling themselves right now. There<sq>s people like you, who have the knowledge and the luck/grace/skill/privilege/whatever to have understood it at the societally-approved age and gotten in your practice. On the other hand, there are people who are going to buy a brand new Arduino or RasPi every time they want to build something (which is also a sort of financial privilege I don<sq>t have) and, as they say, when you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.<br><br>Then there<sq>s me - and I say <dq>me<dq> because I feel totally alone most of the time - where Arduino et al opened the door for a better understanding, and provided me with just enough of a success rate to use it as a stepping stone onto some other things. Now I<sq>m not programming PICs, mind you, or doing diode steering, but I have moved a little beyond using a pre-made shield for everything, and that<sq>s a lot more than I could say for my poor, learning-disabled, anxious ass prior.<br><br>These days, I look at a lot of things I want to build and I am additionally anxious that I missed the boat, I<sq>m about 30 years too late. Arduino people still use breadboards, protoboard, 0.1<dq> pin headers, but increasingly, nothing comes in DIP anymore. That really turns the knife in my heart because in the 80s, *everything* came in DIP and I didn<sq>t understand 1<percent> of what I do now. What is the use, to a maker or hacker, or someone like me, if there<sq>s an IC that does *everything* I want with no external circuitry beyond a couple of passives, but it<sq>s only available in QFN40? With a ground pad? There are wildly talented people in this sub that will tell me all I need is an old toaster oven and a lot of patience, but on average my success depends largely on what<sq>s available in breakout boards.<br><br>So there<sq>s an economy - as there should be, I<sq>m not suggesting digital communism here - whereby the breakout boards that get made have to reflect what most hackers/makers are doing. The Arduino is a breakout board for the ATMEGA328. And if all makers want to do is use a 16MHz CPU to blink an LED, then that<sq>s all we<sq>ll get in the market. it<sq>s a double-edged sword. Yes, I have myriad tools available that I didn<sq>t have before, but it hastens the time I will outgrow them, at a much faster pace than I can learn. That market also, necessarily, focuses on basics and only basics because that<sq>s the majority of Arduino people.<br><br>Here<sq>s a good example of what I<sq>m talking about. I<sq>m building something right now that will use an Arduino for user input and a couple of HD44780 LCDs to provide output, and to drive a bunch of relays to switch audio signals. Yes, I know with proper DC bias I can do it all with CMOS switches, but actually that<sq>s one of the things that can (and has, in my experience) gone wrong every time I<sq>ve tried it that I instinctively distrust it. So, whatever; actual relays will work fine for my application. Now I<sq>m designing a PCB in Eagle. So I have been doing research on the proper way(s) to drive a relay - the transistor, the diode, the resistors - and for a year or more that<sq>s all I<sq>ve been running across. Now the relays I<sq>m using are so small that it<sq>s hard to be space-efficient on the board because the driving circuity (again, not comfortable with SMT) is larger than each relay.<br><br>So, last night, accidentally I ran across the ULN2805 - an 8-channel Darlington driver that needs *no* external components. Control signal in one side, relay on the other side, done. And they still make it in DIP18. Cut my board size (and price, natch) in *half*.<br><br>That<sq>s the double-edged sword about the Arduino ecosystem. Sure I can buy a Sainsmart 8-relay board with all the stuff on it on Amazon for $10, but what if I need DPDT relays instead of SPDT? What if it doesn<sq>t fit in my project case? What if I don<sq>t need 250VAC capability and need to go to a smaller relay? There<sq>s a huge chasm between the Arduino ecosystem and being a successful, well-equipped EE and I feel like I<sq>m in it.<br><br>Another example - what if I wanted to build something using the TI PurePath chips? These things are great. 4 channel audio transceiver,  24/96 digital, 2.4GHz, MCU controllable, auto channel-hopping, auto channel negotiation, <20ms audio latency. The chips are ~$40 but TI will send you samples *for free*. But they<sq>re QFN40 with a ground pad. 2mm square. I can barely handle a 555 without dropping it. Nobody is going to sell a breakout board for that chip; there<sq>s no demand, plus you<sq>d need to recoup the cost of buying the chip at retail. Meanwhile I have $250 worth of them and I can<sq>t use them. Even if I could use solder paste and an old toaster oven, I<sq>ve never done that before, and I imagine I<sq>d ruin three or four of them. TI offers a <dq>development kit<dq> for $150 that includes two boards with sample circuits built out around the chip, and for some people - me included at this point - that<sq>s a lot of money. Again, I understand and agree with how the free market works; I<sq>m just answering your question as to the challenges some of us still face.<br><br>A great example of the market failing me personally is with PWM dimming of LEDs. It<sq>s a great trick for indicators, but as more of the world converts to non-incandescent light for their homes and businesses, there are some problems with PWM dimming. Say you<sq>re making tech videos on YouTube. Unless you have some $50,000 Hollywood camera, every camera you have has a cheap rolling shutter system, which wreaks havoc with PWM-dimmed LEDs. You actually get black lines in your picture because as it scans the sensor, the LEDs are turning on and off. It would be one thing if they weren<sq>t trying to outlaw light bulbs. LED strips are great, but the RGB ones are common anode, which means you *have* to dim them with PWM. A single-color LED strip, sure, you can use an LM317 to reduce the voltage which has the side effect of reducing the current, but you can<sq>t mix the colors of RGB LEDs in the same way when you have one 12V input and three cathodes. It makes a chasm. Either I do it the <dq>maker<dq> way or I have to be a world-class power supply designer, or re-invent the LED strip and hide in Bunnie Huang<sq>s luggage the next time he goes to Shenzhen to find a cheap factory.<br><br>There<sq>s so much about electronics that, if you didn<sq>t go to school for EE, doesn<sq>t make sense. Schematics are written as if electrons flow from positive to negative, but they flow in the opposite direction. The schematic symbol for a diode is backwards. That TI PurePath chip I was talking about earlier, *eleven* of the 40 pins are to be connected to VCC. Think about that<colon> it auto-negotiates and frequency-hops around the 2.4GHz spectrum...digitizes and un-digitizes multiple channels of HD audio at blazing speed...doesn<sq>t have a power bus. Really? One resistor is a current divider, two resistors are a voltage divider. People are still hand-winding air-core inductors whose resonant frequency may change irrevocably if they have to put the breadboard aside for a few days and something disturbs the distance between the windings.<br><br>The problem I have with the <dq>Lego brick<dq> approach is, mostly, that I can<sq>t get the Lego bricks I need to build that way. And the only other approach is going to college for 8 years and hoping I understand everything after all the money is gone. Even my local makerspace is too expensive for me to afford, and it<sq>s made up mostly of local twentysomething IT guys in khakis that just want to have a LAN that doesn<sq>t belong to their boss and do the occasional 16MHz-CPU-blinking-an-LED project, or add Bluetooth to their motorcycle. I hope, as an EE, you can understand where I<sq>m coming from; the Arduino ecosystem is totally a double-edged sword, catapulting you quickly to a set level of knowledge, at which point it goes back to being nearly impossible for some of us to progress any further, unless somebody decides the exact breakout board I need will sell millions.</p>",

At DC, inductors have 0 ohms, but as you increase the frequency, the resistance increases, because the inductor tries to <dq>prevent<dq> changes in current and since AC causes a lot of changes in current, it<sq>s resistance increases. And capacitors have infinite ohms at DC once they<sq>re charged. As you increase the frequency, their resistance decreases because they try to prevent changes in voltage. By <dq>shorting<dq> their pins together, they can accomplish it. And a capacitor of a higher value has the same impedance at a lower frequency as a capacitor of a lower value at a higher frequency. So bigger capacitance means less impedance. And bigger inductance means more impedance. So when you work with high frequencies and want to transmit energy, then you want that the conductors have a low inductance end-to-end and a low capacitance so that they don<sq>t short out each other.</p>",

Nothing in reality perfectly allows the flow of current, everything **resists** in some way. This just makes electrons harder to push through a wire, and turns some of the energy in the flow of that current into heat. <br><br>But little known is the fact that everything also has **capacitance** and **inductance** of some kind. On a pure, unchanging DC signal (say the lights in a car) - capacitance and inductance play no role after the first few moments of turning it on, and we really just ignore it. Voltage stays the same, and current has no reason to ever change. <br><br>But when you start switching the voltage (and therefore current) back and forth, you<sq>ll notice a lag between the supply and the end of a long wire connected to it (greater than the speed of electrons in that material). <br><br>This is because AC has different properties than DC. As you change voltage supplied to the wires, components, or circuits, they resist **change** as well as resisting the flow of current that comes from having a voltage at whatever level (like in a DC circuit).<br><br>So you add the factor of it resisting change to the factor of it resisting current, and you<sq>ve got impedance.<br><br>In inductors, energy is stored in magnetic fields, which is delivered as forcing the circuit to better maintain current.<br><br>In capacitors, energy is stored in potentials, which is delivered as forcing the circuit to better maintain voltage. <br><br>So with these two properties, it *likes* to be a DC circuit (always pushing for constant voltage and constant current), but the supply keeps changing voltage (and therefore current) so the components just continually do their best to try to keep it consistent as possible. <br><br><br>----------------------<br><br>There is a video from the 70<sq>s I remember seeing with a bunch of guys in a pool running in a circle to create a whirlpool with rubber ducks representing the flow of electrons.

In the case you mention, the contents of the A register is copied into the arithmatic unit, and incremented by one.

Poor [RP Feynman tried to make changes](http<colon>//www.textbookleague.org/103feyn.htm), but it totally defeated him long before he got to the physics books.   Nobody in later decades has had any better luck.  These incorrect books cause great problems for beginners who want to visualize what<sq>s going on inside the wires.   <br><br>Perhaps the biggest problem is that *two separate things* flow in electric circuits, yet the books call both of them by the name <dq>electricity.<dq>    How do we measure the flow of electricity; in watts or in amperes?   Watts and amperes are measuring two entirely different flows.  Calling them both by the name <dq>flowing electricity;<dq> that<sq>s as bad as teaching everyone that sound is the same thing as Oxygen.<br><br>OK, in metal electric circuits there are two separate things flowing<colon>  energy-waves and electrons.    The electrons always go in a circle (or, in AC they wiggle back and forth in that circle,) and their top speed is very slow.    On the other hand, the energy-waves go at nearly the speed of light, they *don<sq>t* go in a circle.  And in AC circuits the waves *don<sq>t* move back and forth, but instead flow constantly ahead.   For example, the energy in a flashlight goes from battery to light bulb, one way down both wires.   Or the energy goes from electric company to distant homes, one-way rapidly (one way along *all three wires* of the power grid.)   At the same time, the electrons found inside the wires are flowing totally differently...<br><br>The speed of electrons during an electric current is not c, not the speed of light.   Electron-flow has nothing to do with the speed of light.    Instead, electrons travel quite slowly, with top speeds of inches per minute.  Look up some physics websites about <dq>Drift Velocity<dq> of electrons, those are pages describing the flow-speed of electric current.   The electron drift-speed is proportional to the amperes, so if we double the electron speed, we double the electric current.   But also their speed is controlled by the size of the wire (the area,) so when electrons flow from a narrow wire to a wide one, they slow down, even if the total flow-rate is the same in both sections of the wire.<br><br>Also, note that during electric currents, the density of electrons is fairly constant.   Every atom in the copper metal will donate one mobile electron.   So, the number of electrons in any bit of copper is the same as the number of atoms in that bit of copper.   The <dq>electricity<dq> inside metals is very, very densely packed.   Just a very slow flow will give a huge amperage.   As JC Maxwell describes, electricity behaves like a nearly-incompressible fluid which fills all electric circuits.<br><br>If all this is hard to visualize, you can try out the water analogy.   But if you suspect that your confusion is caused by the analogy, then stick to electron-flows only.     Me, I suspect that the analogy isn<sq>t your problem at all.     First you have to accept that all wires are always full of electricity, that batteries are electron-pumps, and that electric currents are not a flow of energy.<br><br>PS<br><br>Traditionally we don<sq>t use visual teaching where circuitry is involved.

I<sq>m in 12th grade myself, so feel free to ask for any more clarification, although I<sq>ve tried to make the following as easy to understand as possible while still being comprehensive.<br><br>Voltage (in volts) is just the potential energy (in joules) between two points for every coulomb (6.241\u00d710^18 electrons). In other words, it<sq>s basically the amount of energy an electron stores and can release, usually as heat, when it goes from point A to B. Voltage is relative. When current flows through a resistor and gives off heat, you can say that, relative to the negative terminal of the battery, one side of the resistor is at 4 volts, and the other at 3 volts. You can also say that the voltage across the resistor is 1 volt. This is the voltage drop of the resistor.<br><br>Current (in amps) is how many coulombs (again, 6.241\u00d710^18 electrons) pass through a point in a circuit in one second. Current can change in a conductor because just because electrons are there doesn<sq>t mean they have to be moving.<br><br>Resistance is the relationship between voltage and current in a resistor, determined by the equation V=IR, ohm<sq>s law, which says that the voltage across a resistor (energy per coulomb) is equal to the current though the resistor (coulombs passing per second) times the scaling factor resistance (measured in ohms). What this equation says is that when current through a resistor increases, more energy from each electron is converted into heat, so the voltage drop will be greater. Resistance changes with material; a colder, thicker wire will heat up less with the same current, so the voltage drop will be lower.<br><br>Power (in joules per seconds, or watts) is determined with P=VI. It<sq>s I, current, the number of coulombs passing through a circuit per second, times V, voltage, the energy each coulombs loses. For example, if a resistor had a current of 5 amps running through it, and the voltage dropped by 2 volts across it, this means the resistor would be giving off 10 joules of heat every second.</p>",

If you<sq>re waiting, for instance, for a falling edge of a signal in order to do something, the FPGA<sq>s reaction time is going to be REALLY quick. It has dedicated logic sitting there waiting, doing expressly this, and nothing else (in this particular group of hardware). Of course, the FPGA can be doing other things in parallel in other parts of the chip.  <br><br>But because of the designs that CPUs normally find themselves in, the CPU will likely be doing some background task processing, and a falling edge would trigger an interrupt. And then the CPU has to detect that this has occurred, and then it has to do a lookup into interrupt-handler table, and then jump to that location of the code, start executing the code, and then if the response desired is another signal, then transmit that signal. And remember that many OSs have multiple layers of hardware abstraction.... in order to make the software easy(and safe), they insulate the programmer from the hardware. This adds reaction time when you are jumping through multiple API hoops to get at the hardware.  <br><br>Long story short is that their use-cases are completely different. We use CPUs because we have high-level constructs that make it easier for us to write code. It<sq>s easier to use C for many tasks than design that same function in digital logic. For most complex tasks, you<sq>d use a CPU for everything you can, but implement the time-critical portions in hardware --- using an FPGA when you have a decent amount of hardware to implement. Plenty of digital designs do not require an FPGA OR a CPU, so your task has to be fairly complicated before these discussions even begin.  <br><br>This is a drastic oversimplification but CPUs will not be replacing programmable digital logic in the near future.<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>Simply put, it<sq>s thanks to semiconductor technology.  A human can switch a lightswitch on and off maybe around 7hz. An electromechanical relay can maybe do it at 60-100hz (probably quickly destroying the relay with the arcing and sparking).  A transistor has no such moving parts (hence the term <dq>solid state<dq>) and can theoretically switch currents as fast as the electrons  flowing through it will allow.  There are limits to this due to the real world not always matching up to the <dq>theoretical<dq> world and the construction and design of the transistor, but these limits are very, very high even for the slowest semiconductor devices.<br><br>Edit<colon> ever rode in an electric train or subway? Those electric motors are actually being switched on and off at several khz by large banks of semiconductors called IGBTs.  The speed of the motor is varied by controlling the length of the <dq>on<dq> time vs. the <dq>off<dq> time, called the <dq>duty cycle<dq>, and because it switches so fast, the motor just sees an average of these two time periods due to its slow response time.  You can sometimes even hear the high pitched whine coming from the motor because the switching speed happens to lie within the range of human hearing, turning the motor into sort of a <dq>speaker<dq>.<br><br>This is how digital circuits control analog devices with varying voltage and is called <dq>Pulse width modulation<dq>.  Pretty much every digitally controlled motor/light/whatever is controlled this way.<br><br>Edit<colon> a way of achieving high frequencies to drive these transistors (especially in RF circuits like you mentioned) is by taking advantage of resonance.  Imagine a wine glass.  You tap it once per second (1hz) but it will ring at a frequency many thousands of times higher than that.  This is how oscillators work.  The frequency of an oscillator is determined by either crystals which ring at a set frequency, or a resonant capacitor/inductor circuit.  The <dq>tapping<dq> (like the wine glass) is is done by either a transistor or vacuum tube, which will begin to switch on and off at a frequency determined by the resonant part of the circuit.<br><br>Edit<colon> you can even multiply the base frequencies of these oscillators many times higher using what<sq>s called a <dq>phase-locked loop<dq>.  That<sq>s what a lot of modern high frequency equipment nowadays does, like cell phones and WiFi.  Generate the high frequency, impose modulation on it, such as varying the frequency a bit or the phase of the wave to impose information on it such as analog voice or data protocols, and send it out through an antenna that<sq>s carefully built to be tuned with the wave and radiate it, and there you go.<br><br>All this was basically Nikola Tesla<sq>s whole deal, that everything, even the entire planet, has a fundamental resonance frequency.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>(You<sq>ve already received an excellent explanation. I<sq>m going to take a slightly different approach. Multiple explanations can sometimes help).<br><br>People commonly think of the purpose of a resistor being to limit current. It can sometimes help to think of a resistor as being a way to allow two points that are connected to be at different voltages.<br><br>When you connect a constant voltage V directly to some terminal X of some device, then X is forced to voltage V. When you instead hook up through a resistor, X can be at a voltage other than V, and it is the device that gets to decide that voltage by controlling the current through the resistor and hence the voltage drop across the resistor. The value of the resistor determines how sensitive the voltage at X is to changes in current.<br><br>So suppose you<sq>ve got a device that would <dq>like<dq> 1 V, and you are giving it 3 V. If you use a low value resistor, the device will have to pull a lot of current to lower the voltage to 1 V, and that might exceed the device<sq>s current handling capability. If you use a high value resistor, the device only needs to pull a very small current to lower the voltage, but that might not be enough current to operate the device. This is why you have to pick the resistor to fit the device needs instead of just tossing in any random resistor you find lying around the bench or sticking out of your beard.<br><br>When you give each parallel diode its own resistor, each diode gets to adjust its current to get the voltage it wants, independent of what the other diodes are doing. They all can make themselves happy, only limited by the possibility that if you have too many of them the total current may be more than your power source can handle, and so the voltage may start going down.<br><br>When you just put the diodes in parallel, and then give the who parallel group one resistor, then all the diodes are forced to operate at the same voltage. It is very unlikely that there will be one voltage that is optimal for all of the diodes (there are variations from diode to diode even among the same model), so you may get uneven lighting.<br><br>Also, if a diode fails, it may cause a chain reaction failure. Suppose you have N diodes, all actually identical. You<sq>ve picked the resistor so the diodes are all operating at their optimal point. The N diodes are drawing a certain combined current, which they contribute equally to, that causes a voltage drop across the resistor that gives the voltage the diodes are happiest with.<br><br>Now one of the diodes dies, so that it acts like an open circuit on that branch. You now have only N-1 diodes, but your resistor value was chosen for N diodes. You resistor is now undervalued, and the N-1 diodes will have to increase their current draw to find their new happy point (which will be a higher voltage and current point than where they were). For a large N, this probably isn<sq>t a big deal. The current and voltage increase will probably be small. But if N is only 3, it could be significant...perhaps enough to cause another diode to fail, and then the one remaining diode would likely soon follow.<br><br>When each diode has its own resistor, it doesn<sq>t matter if one of the other diodes dies. </p>",

This is why it<sq>s hot. You get in between it and ground/neutral and you can fry a hot dog<colon> [video](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo_jLssjOYE)<br><br>The neutral line is approximately at ground. The only difference is that any current that goes in and out of hot should go out and in on neutral. This current times wire resistance (to ground) is a voltage drop and why neutral is different than ground (usually a few volts rms). An absence of this voltage will tell you that there isn<sq>t a separate wire for ground and neutral or there isn<sq>t a significant current on neutral. Also, the GFCI breakers you see around sinks and other water work by determining if the current going out of the hot line is the opposite on the neutral line. <br><br>Ground should be very close to earth potential since under normal circumstances there shouldn<sq>t be any current on it. Any electronics with a metal enclosure or other metal that isn<sq>t connected to the electronics should be connected to ground. If not, a hot wire can touch that piece of metal/conductor and fry the next innocent bystander. If it is grounded, when the hot wire touches, it will trip the breaker because of an over current short on the line. If ground is poorly designed in your house, it can carry the current from hot and also be at a voltage. This is why some old homes will give you a shock if you touch a metal enclosure that is grounded.<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Notice the thick copper pour going to the right side of the mezzanine connector. You circled your edited photo with alternating red and magenta loops so I<sq>m assuming you buzzed those out with the meter and found that every second one is shorted. If you pull off the connector, you should notice a similar thick copper pour on the opposite side. If this is the case, they<sq>re your GND and Vcc.<br><br>Grounds are usually a good starting point. Try your luck and see if either of those pours are connected to the metallic brace for the fan. If so, congrats this is your ground, and the other is Vcc. If not, you<sq>re gonna have to get freaky with the capacitors.<br><br>A good place to start would be on the two capacitors (browny orange things) just north of the A5930 IC you circled. You can immediately see a trace connecting the right side of the left capacitor to the left side of the right capacitor. Now check if the capacitors are in parallel. Do this by putting your meter in continuity and seeing if there is a connection between the left side of the left capacitor and the right side of the right capacitor. If there isn<sq>t, you can be 99<percent> certain the trace between them is ground. Confirm this by putting one of your meter probes on the right side of the left capacitor OR the left side of the right capacitor and the other probe to one of the copper pours at the mezzanine connector. If it beeps, it<sq>s ground. If those caps ARE in parallel, put one probe on one of the pads and put the other probe on another capacitor somewhere else on the board and see if they connect in any way. If they do, the pad that beeps is probably your ground. Reasoning is, any capacitors used in this application are probably going to be decoupling. you probably won<sq>t find one in series with anything and they<sq>ll all almost certainly go to ground. My money is on <dq>1<dq> being ground and <dq>4<dq> being Vcc.<br><br>Once you<sq>ve got your ground, you<sq>ve also got your Vcc, since it<sq>ll be the opposite pour. You can probably safely now apply 12V to these pins and start probing around the board. The components directly to the right of the mezzanine connector are most likely a local switching regulator. Reasoning is, there is a diode, caps, and what appears to be an 0402 inductor. You can confirm this by probing the two capacitors. The one next to the diode should have +12V on it and the one next to the IC should have something else (+5V perhaps?). If this is the case, this is a regulator and of no interest to you.<br><br>Last things left are the two signal pins. If this is indeed a standard 4-pin fan (it probably will be, no need for them to reinvent the wheel), one will be PWM and the other will be the feedback. This is where an oscilloscope will probably come in handy since you will be able to see the actual signal with all its fidelity. A multimeter may or may not however do the trick. The basic idea here is, as long as the board is powered, the controller will be monitoring the speed of the fan. So, if you power it up, probe the two signal pins, and spin the fan with your hand, you should see some signal develop on one of the two pins. This is your feedback and the other is your control.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>OK, take a deep breath and let<sq>s start at the bottom... <br><br>Imagine that the universe only contains one electron and nothing else. Also, let<sq>s imagine vectors (which are just lines that have a direction) radiating out of that one electron towards all directions so that if you would follow any one of those vectors to it<sq>s start you would end up at the position of our electron. Now imagine we move our electron for a distance (there is no intrinsic <dq>up<dq> and <dq>down<dq> in the universe, so let<sq>s say, by convention, that the direction we moved our electron is <dq>down<dq>) very quickly (almost instantaneously). You would imagine the vectors also displacing themselves down all across the universe to point to the new location of our electron. But, there is a catch<colon> the vectors can<sq>t be displaced across their whole length instantaneously. There is a set speed at which the change in position moves across the vectors. Thus, we must imagine very sharp bends (<dq>knicks<dq>) forming on the vectors and those knicks move away from the electron at this set speed. So, if you were sitting a long distance away from the electron and watching the vectors, you would not know that the electron moved until the knicks arrived to where you were looking at. Also, and this is a bit hard to imagine but if you think about it that<sq>s how it is, the knicks get <dq>sharper<dq> on the vectors that radiate 90 degrees to the direction we moved the electron and there are *no* knicks radiating towards and away the direction we moved the electron. This will become important later on.<br><br>So far so good. Now let<sq>s add another electron to our universe, to the left of and far away from the first electron. As you might already know, electrons are both negatively charged and because of a law of the universe called <dq>Coulomb<sq>s law<dq> they attract and will move towards each other if nothing is in their way. Let<sq>s for sake of simplicity also imagine that the first electron is actually <dq>trapped<dq> in a magical tube and can<sq>t actually move any other direction other than up and down. So, what we have then is the second electron (let<sq>s call it electron B) moving towards the first electron (the one in the tube, let<sq>s call it electron A). But how does it know where to head towards to? Easy<colon> follow the vector. The vector will always lead you towards electron A.<br><br>Now imagine I move electron A down again. What happens to electron B? It keeps moving towards the *old* position of electron A *until* it encounters the knick on the vector. Then it changes direction and starts moving towards the new position of electron A.<br><br>Great. Now imagine we <dq>trap<dq> electron B in exactly the same way we did with electron A<colon> a tube that only allows it to move up and down for a small distance and let<sq>s see what happens... Since both electrons can<sq>t move either left or right they stand still (if there were no tubes, they would move towards each other, but the tubes prevent that from happening). Now, imagine I move electron A down. What happens to electron B? Well, nothing at first. Until the knicks arrive, nothing happens to it. The moment the knicks arrive, it also moves down. So, if I keep moving electron A up and down, electron B would also move up and down but with a time delay of how long it takes the knicks to reach it.<br><br>If you think about it, this is more or less how EM radiation works. The vectors are the EM field, the <dq>set speed<dq> is the speed of light, <dq>knicks<dq> are photons and the <dq>tubes<dq> are antennas. Of course, there are other subtleties to it that are lost in this example but this is the general idea.</p>",

The self-sustaining loop this forms results in what<sq>s called <dq>propagation<dq>, or the travel of a radio wave through space. We simply have created a generator which can generate this electric field at high speed. Specifically ~2.4 billion cycles per second, cycles being the process of the generation changing from a positive voltage to a negative one and back. Due to a property of physics, the antenna being the correct size causes the changing electric field in the wire to cause a magnetic field in the space around it, which further causes an electric field and so on and so forth. This happens at the speed of light, and the field is reduced in intensity by travel through space, and greatly reduced by travel through dense objects such as metal and concrete. There<sq>s many other interesting facets to how this works and is the basis of Electrical Engineering, so it<sq>s not easy to sum up in a few words.<br><br>Edit<colon> I should also add that the pattern of the waves is determined by the shape and position of the antenna(s). The typical 3<dq> long plastic stick is a dipole inside, meaning it has two elements. It radiates in a doughnut shape, and is rather deaf towards the tip of the wires. So you<sq>d orient the dipole to be perpendicular to the receiver for best reception. Linear antennas which feature <dq>higher gain<dq> is actually a tradeoff, you don<sq>t get power/signal strength for free. These compress the doughnut shape into a flat disc, again perpendicularly to the direction of the elements. You<sq>d have best reception towards the horizon and get drastically worse as you increase the angle the receiver sees it from 90 degrees. Antennas with very high gain (yagi, axial helix, lpda, and parabolic dish) focus the wave into a tight cone. These are typically used for a fixed point to point link and must be aimed accurately at their target. Also effects such as reflection, addition/cancellation, diffraction, refraction, and scattering also come into play when the wave interacts with various obstacles. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>A note<colon> I<sq>ve been out of my EE text books for ages. I know I have the correct idea, but I may have the terminology wrong. Sorry to OP if they were looking for a more technical answer, I went with definitions and lay mans explanations. Also, LONG SRY PLS FORGIVE.<br><br>I<sq>ll give you it from the wave theory on up. <br><br>The funny thing about wave theory is that it is nearly universal. You only have to understand one basic principle to make it easier to understand. There are TWO types of waves. Most of what we thing of as waves (like the ocean) are literal waves, they usually look like actual physical sine waves! When we talk about radio propagation, we are actually talking about amplitude-based waves (with exception of antennas themselves, but that<sq>s beyond what I can explain without a piece of paper and a coffee). The wave isn<sq>t physically going up and down so much as it<sq>s amplitude is pulsating in a inconsistent pattern. Because of the pulses, signal strength can vary second to second as the reflective interference from all sources changes. It<sq>s very hard to visualize this, which is why I<sq>m using water in my examples.<br><br>I<sq>ll use water as an example but I<sq>ll put a near equivalent in reference to radio in parentheses. We will start with question 2, in which 3 roughly gets answered, and then moved to question 1.<br><br>Image a pool of water. When you drop a bowling ball (packet of info) in from a certain hight (power level), rippled waves go out (packet is sent). Say you have a person standing on the other side of the pool (receiver) who is waiting to get their feet wet from the wave (waiting to receive information). If the wave is high enough(has enough power at a given distance) and still has enough force(packet is clearly readable), it will only get their feet wet (information is received correctly). <br><br>Now, if you put a gigantic pole (physical obstruction) in the pool DIRECTLY between the drop location (broadcaster) and the person (receiver), wouldn<sq>t that effect the quality and hight (quality and strength) of the wave? <br><br>Now image a foam pool toy placed across the pool. That would have the same dampening effect that a thin wall would have. It<sq>s not the best example but it<sq>s enough to give a basic idea that it<sq>s amazing we can get most signals to work as well as they do.<br><br>A little interesting bit is that most (re<colon> omnidirectional) radio signals are best received in a donut shaped range. To close to the source can actually cause interference. As far as the way that different radios broadcast, most wifi and FM band are omnidirectional antenna and have that donut effect. There are mono-directional and bidirectional antenna used in some radio settings, but they tend to be rather specialized (see microwave transmitters for cell towers and yagi antenna for OTA pre-digital TV).<br><br>The other thing to remember is that waves usually follow the rule of inverse squaring. A rough approximation is that doubling the distance from a source cuts the amplitude to 1/4 of the original distance. I know someone is going to ream me for simplifying it that much but it<sq>s true IN THEORY. In practice, this doesn<sq>t work well with radio signals as they have so many outside factors. <br><br></p>",

This means that MOSFETs will usually be easier to use for high current applications, such as motor and lighting control. Up to a certain level, anyway...for really high currents, even a very low RDSon can result in a higher voltage drop than the typical saturated junction voltage drop of a BJT. That<sq>s why you see hybrid devices in things like electric cars, which use IGBTs (essentially a giant BJT driven by a MOSFET).<br><br>HOWEVER<colon> you only get a low MOSFET RDSon if you can fully drive the gate.

Let<sq>s say you switch a MOSFET on using a microcontroller output...maybe it<sq>ll take a few microseconds. During that time, it<sq>s not saturated!

MOSFETs saturate to a resistance, so the power dissipation is I^2 \\*R. BJTs, on the other hand, saturate to a voltage, so their power dissipation is Vsat*I. For very large currents, the BJT will actually dissipate less power than the MOSFET. For smaller currents, the MOSFET dissipates less power. When you<sq>re switching small currents, the power dissipation is negligible for both device types, and either type works just fine.<br><br>Another difference between the two is that BJTs are able to work at higher frequencies than MOSFETs, although this only becomes noticeable at frequencies that are much higher than what you<sq>re probably working with.<br><br>The last big difference between the two is that BJTs require some current through the base terminal in order to function, while the MOSFET requires no static input current at the gate.

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m going to copy and paste the best answer I found when I was looking into the same thing a while back<colon><br><br>There are difference between the two.....obviously. I can only point out a few comes into my mind so chances are I am going to miss some<colon> <br><br><br>1) First and most important is the input current. BJT is a current device that amplifier the base current by \u03b2. So it needs base current. MOSFET on the other hand as the name indicates..<dq>Insulated gate<dq>. The gate is really a capacitor and the charge on the gate cause inversion at the channel right under the oxide insulator when turn on. So if you have very high impedance drive that cannot provide current, but only voltage, MOSFET will be a much better device to use. <br><br>2) BJT can go into saturation where both the BE and BC diode both turn on at the same time. When that happens, it will take some time ( into u sec.) to get out of saturation and turn off even if you remove the base drive. This is commonly called recovery time. MOSFET do not have that problem at all, as soon as the Vgs goes below the turn on voltage, the FET turns off. That<sq>s one important reason why digital IC today mostly are CMOS logic because the internal speed is so so much faster than TTL which is BJT. <br><br>3) When BJT goes into saturation, it still has about 0.3V across the collector emitter, MOSFET behave like a resistor when fully turned on. The bigger the MOSFET, the lower the Rds on resistance. <br><br><br>That all sounded good, but there are few catches<colon> <br><br>1) The capacitance of the input of MOSFET can be high if the transistor is large. A power MOSFET can have input capacitance in excess of 3nF. Driving MOSFET require strong drive to get speed. That<sq>s the reason why the processor can run GHz internally, but when the signals and bus interface to external logics, the speed is not very fast. Transistor for internal logic is very small, don<sq>t have much gate capacitance, so very little drive requirement is required. But when it has to drive external bus, much stronger drive is necessary to sink and source a few mA. The transistor has to be much bigger than those for internal logics and it need much strong pre drive. Sometimes, the internal logics has to be buffered a few stages before gaining enough drive for external bus. That really kill the speed. It is common for power amp to have BJT as a pre driver stage just to drive the big power MOSFET. <br><br>2) Small signal MOSFET has much higher 1/f noise that dominates the lower audio frequency range. The noise can extend all the way into MHz and beyond. Noise performance is almost inferior for regular speed op-amp, much worst for audio circuits. <br><br>3) the Gate source turn on voltage variation between MOSFET even on the same die is much greater than Vbe of BJT, temperature drift is much higher. If you want precision op-amp, BJT op-amp are mostly superior. <br><br>4) Because the gate source turn on voltage vary with temperature, propagation delay of logic change with temperature is much worst than TTL or ECL. For precision timing control, you cannot use CMOS logics....at least up to a few years ago. <br><br><br>The major problem of MOSFET is the input capacitance that limit the usefulness. But in RF world, people make use of this. LDMOS is very popular in RF power amps. We always use matching network to get best power transfer. The matching network usually have a capacitor right before the input of the power transistor. A lot of RF power BJT are actually a hybrid where they put chip capacitors inside before the base. They have to put it inside because the lead inductance of the transistor become inductive at that frequency and create an inductor after the capacitor if it is outside. The input capacitance of the LDMOS is actually being used as that stage. This will reduce the cost tremendously as you don<sq>t need to put chip capacitors anymore. <br><br><br>MOSFET and new group III and V transistor ( function either like MOSFET or JFET) really taking over BJT in microwave electronics. At microwave frequency, the noise of these devices are lower than BJT as it is beyond the 1/f noise range. All you have to do is using high pass filter to block the lower 1/f noise. At this frequency, BJT has a big disadvantage that it draws base current and thereby has current shot noise that can be bad. FETs has only thermal noise to deal with at microwave frequency. It is common to find FETs with noise figure below 2db or even 1db.<br><br>Reference https<colon>//www.physicsforums.com/threads/when-to-use-a-bjt-or-fet.640242/</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As 1Davide said, you want a MOSFET.  Here are some ways I shop for them, in no particular order<colon><br><br>\u25ba Right off the bat, you can filter by number of pins.  You probably want 3, and can eliminate the specialty stuff you aren<sq>t interested in right away.<br><br>\u25ba If you believe you will need a heatsink (you very well may not), shop for heatsinks first.  Especially true if you think you need a big one that can passively cool several watts.  The little ones that are just a bit of bent sheet metal are easy, but there<sq>s a small selection of bigger, cheaper heatsinks.  Reason to shop for these first is it will give you a list of what package types to filter for, which really helps narrow down your selection.  What you<sq>re looking for in heatsinks is <dq>Degrees per Watt<dq>, which gives you a very rough idea of how hot the heatsink gets when you try to cool a certain number of watts through it.<br><br>\u25ba Determine the voltage at which you want the mosfet to be fully switched on.  This is V^GS  and can be somewhat a limiting factor if you<sq>re looking to push a lot of current, like through a motor.  Sites often let you filter for V^GS threshold voltage.  Look for MOSFETs with a V^GS threshold that is significantly below your ON voltage.  (The threshold voltage is where the transistor starts to be affected by the gate voltage, not the voltage where it turns fully on.)  Use a min/max filter on this, and increase the max if you aren<sq>t finding what you need.<br><br>\u25ba Look by package type.  (The list you get from looking at heatsinks helps here.)  If you<sq>re driving something big, look at packages like the TO-220.  (There are lots.)  This can get confusing, but if you can e.g. eliminate surface mount package types when you<sq>re doing through-hole, it really helps.<br><br>\u25ba Look for low R^DS ON resistance.  The lower the R^DS ON, the less power the transistor burns with higher current.<br><br>\u25ba You can look for R^DS ON test voltage, but generally it<sq>s possible to operate the mosfet much lower than this test voltage while only gaining a few milliohms.  It<sq>s like V^GS threshold...  If the number is lower, you have a better chance of finding a transistor that works well at your lower voltage.  Manufacturers can show better R^DS if they use a higher V^GS though, so they tend to e.g. use 14v to test a mosfet when 5v would have been perfectly acceptable.<br><br>\u25ba Look at Continuous Drain Current.  It<sq>s not the most useful thing to shop by (the manufacturer tends to boost this any way they can too) but you can use a min/max filter to help you look only at tiny low-power transistors, or big beefy motor-driving transistors.<br><br>Once you have a filtered list showing transistors that are roughly the kind you want to be looking at, sort by price and start looking at datasheets.  I usually skip right past the tables of specs and look at the performance graphs.  First, find R^DS vs. V^GS and verify that you can operate that transistor at an acceptably low R^DS using your intended V^GS.  Use the graph to figure out what R^DS you can expect.  Take your intended current and that R^DS, and use P = I^2 R to figure out how many watts you<sq>ll burn while it<sq>s on.  If you get an acceptable number, you have a match.  <br><br>At that point, I scan the rest of the datasheet to make sure there aren<sq>t any surprises.  I just want to make sure I haven<sq>t accidentally selected something with a max current or max power that<sq>s too low, max V^DS that<sq>s too low, unacceptably high gate capacitance, or anything like that.  Usually here I<sq>m using the current and voltage I intend to apply while on or off, and marking dots on the various graphs, to get a feel for how the device will behave.  Sometimes this is overkill, but it<sq>s a good idea if you think you<sq>ll be operating it close to the limits.  (Like trying to use a SMD to control a motor.)<br><br>It<sq>s a long, time consuming process.  The sensible thing is to go through it once and find a good all-purpose small mosfet for low-current demands at the voltages you tend to use, and buy a bunch of <sq>em.  Then do it again to find a good all-around high-current mosfet, buy a bunch of those.  Then you only have to go through the grueling process of vetting a new part again if you<sq>re doing something specialized, like trying to maximize battery life or find the perfect component for a device you<sq>re going to make a lot of.<br><br>[Here<sq>s a good high-power low-V^GS low-R^DS mosfet](http<colon>//www.newark.com/nxp/buk9575-55a-127/n-channel-mosfet-trench-automotive/dp/70R3583) that might be good for your needs, depending what voltage you<sq>re going to drive it with.  You get a relatively acceptable 0.06 ohms at 5v V^GS.<br><br>One thing you can do to make your shopping easier is use a different transistor to drive the MOSFET gate using your motor voltage.  Just make sure to remember that the gate is a capacitor.  If you put voltage on it to turn it on and then disconnect the voltage, the motor will keep running.  Also if your path to +V or ground is high resistance, it will transition slowly and your mosfet will heat up more than it should.  You need to provide a low-resistance path to +V to turn it on, and a low-resistance path to ground to turn it off.  (The 555 output pin is fine for this, but it becomes important if you try to build a mosfet driver circuit.)</p>",

Unfortunately it does invert the input, so you<sq>ll need to take whatever your control signal is and invert that, or have your device be powered on and off through it<sq>s ground lead.<br><br>Also this is just a general summary, feel free to correct but I know I<sq>m missing a lot.<br><br>The **common-emitter** is pretty common for switching, this goes through the full operating region of the device. Basically when it<sq>s off it<sq>s fully off, and when it<sq>s on it<sq>s fully on. You can use them linearly too, in which case you invert your input signal. Note since you go through the non-linear region of the device you have to use a few tricks to make it stable as an amplifier (emitter degregation, feedback, etc). This is what a lot of digital logic, [including 74-series logic](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File<colon>TTL_npn_nand.svg), tends to use for an output stage. CMOS Logic is sort of a [sandwich of two common-source amplifiers](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File<colon>CMOS_Inverter.svg) together, although again they tend to be operated as switches.<br><br>The **common-collector** is useful for linear high-current outputs. They are also called **emitter-followers**. They give no voltage gain, but high current gain. Basically, the emitter tracks the input signal volt for volt, with allowance for a diode drop in a BJT. But while the input <sq>sees<sq> a high impedance input the output can be low impedance. This is very common in the output stages of various devices, including opamps and some (ECL) logic gates. The transistor tends to be operated in the linear region, so this configuration is fast but not great for power consumption.<br><br>The **common-base** is typically used on the input stage of a device, including again 74-series logic. You get a high voltage gain out, but no current gain. You also are presented with a low impedance input, but have a high impedance output. This is also not an inverting configuration, and is probably the fastest configuration of a transistor (they are used in RF circuits a lot). </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Well, there are a few things to it. The main issue is convenience. I don<sq>t know how much you know about this, but there are two types of BJT transistors, NPN and PNP. Similarly, there are two types of MOSFET transistors, NMOS and PMOS. An NMOS works differently from a PMOS, namely because an NMOS turns on when the gate-voltage is HIGHER than the source by some threshold voltage (V_GS > V_Th), and the PMOS turns on when the gate voltage is lower than the source voltage. The labelling of drain and source is a bit confusing, and it is similar to collector and emitter with BJT transistors. <br><br>NPN/NMOS is prefered over PNP/PMOS because they are cheaper, since they are physically smaller. Due to production issues, the size of the die in a PMOS/PNP is typically ~3 times lager than an NMOS/NPN with the same capabilities. <br><br>When you have to turn on something with an NMOS transistor, you need to apply a certain voltage to the gate. As mentioned previously, this voltage must be above the source voltage(V_GS > Threshold voltage). If you place the MOSFET between the supply and the load, you will need to get the gate voltage higher than the supply voltage, in order to make it turn on. Thats it. That is why you place the MOSFET between load and ground, because that way you can drive the gate voltage all the way to the supply voltage. But the source voltage will still be at ground(because its connected to ground). This practice is called low-side switching, because the switching MOSFET is placed on the low side of the load.<br><br>Now, if you want to control your load from the high-side, you can do two things. You can either use a PMOS, because that works inversely of an NMOS. This means that you turn it on by lowering the gate voltage. When the gate voltage is as high as the source voltage, its off. When its lower than the source voltage, it will be on. This is why you will see negative numbers for V_GS if you look up a PMOS. This way you can control a device from the high side as well. But PMOS devices are expensive, so sometimes you use an NMOS high-side as well. You then need a gate voltage bigger than the source voltage. This can be acheived by using a bootstrap capacitor. A bootstrap capacitor basically gets charged and is then <dq>lifted up<dq> above the source voltage, so that its charge can be applied to the high-side gate .<br><br>The issue is similar with NPN/PNP transistors. For an NPN transistor to act like a switch(saturation), you need a base voltage that must be larger than the emitter voltage and larger than the collector voltage. Similary, for a PNP you need a base voltage lower than emitter and lower than collector. (You also need the collector and emitter voltages to be right with respect to each other, of course).<br><br>So the reason is that the most typically used transistor types are easier to control if they are placed low-side. <br><br>Regarding your side question<colon><br><br>I don<sq>t know about any videos, sorry. I would suggest that you try out the [Falstad Circuit Simulator](http<colon>//www.falstad.com/circuit/) instead. While it doesn<sq>t do a good job in terms of advanced circuits, it stows the basic principles nicely. Also, there is really no substitute for math, when trying to understand the devices.<br><br>Read the wikipedia articles on [Regions of operation for BJT transistors](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor#Regions_of_operation) and [Modes of operation for MOSFET transistors](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET#Modes_of_operation).

The course does less than all of Horowitz and Hill, of course. We treat chapters 1-11, omitting Chapter 7, on Precision Circuits..., which is more specialized than the rest, and skimming Chapter 4 on Active Filters and Oscillators. Even this selection includes more information than we expect students to absorb fully on a first pass through the book. This Manual tries to guide students to the most important material.<br>The typical student that we see--if there really is a typical student--is an undergraduate majoring in Physics, and wanting to learn enough electronics to let him or her do useful work in a laboratory. But we do not assume such background in these notes. Students very different from that typical student thrive in our course. Graduate students in the sciences appear regularly; during the summer we see many high school students, and some of these do brilliantly; now and then a professor of Physics takes the course (and they do all right, too!). In the <sq>extension<sq> version of the course, we see lots of programmers who want to know what<sq>s going on in their machines, and we see people who just happen to be curious about electronics. That curiosity, in fact, is the only prerequisite for this course, and suggests the only good rule to define who will enjoy it. Someone looking for an engineering course will find our treatment oddly informal, but a person eager to learn how to design useful circuits will like this course.</p>",

Yes, it<sq>s not trivial to make that stuff work, but it<sq>s not that hard either. The earliest radios were spark-gap transmitters, and although their range was limited, they were not complicated. Today, even people with no freakin<sq> idea what they<sq>re doing can make an AM radio transmitter out of an opamp chip and a few resistors and caps. See http<colon>//www.instructables.com/id/Easy-AM-Transmitter/<br><br>Tracking down a radio transmitter is possible, but not trivially easy. Some pirate radio stations have <dq>gone mobile<dq> by putting all their gear in a large van and transmitting as they drive around. The FCC usually can<sq>t track them by radio triangulation, they generally have to visually spot the van.<br><br>Transmitters that don<sq>t move *and* broadcast continuously are generally sitting ducks. Triangulation works well on those kind and it<sq>s only a matter of time.<br><br>A covert radio would be small enough to be easily portable (say, pocket sized or at least clip onto the belt easily) and would only power the RF circuits when the user was holding down a button. Such a radio would be almost impossible to track as long as the person using it was careful to never use it in the same location twice, never use it where he could be seeing using it, and only transmit for ten seconds at a time.<br><br>> What would it take to broadcast a distress signal in an emergency?<br><br>The hard part is the power amplifier to make the outgoing signal strong. The other parts aren<sq>t too difficult.<br><br>> To recieve signal?<br><br>Receivers are usually more complicated and more battery-hungry than transmitters. (Which can be surprising to some people.) As heksodokem said, the simplest receiver is a crystal radio, which is basically just a diode and a poor quality inductor that has lots of stray capacitance.<br><br>> Can you make one from generic parts that will broadcast/receive transmissions or would you need to gut parts from other radios?<br><br>Depends of the frequency. The lower the frequency, the easier it gets. heksodokem<sq>s link talks about <dq>foxhole receivers<dq>, which are about as simple as you can get.<br><br>Even at FM radio frequencies, very simple receivers can be made out of the right kind of transistors. These transistors aren<sq>t in absolutely everything, but they aren<sq>t hard to find either. E.g. http<colon>//www.electroschematics.com/5150/tiny-fm-radio/<br><br>The hard part of building radios is really the theory on how they work, and the expense of the test equipment to verify they<sq>re working.

Some stop band current in the first inductor can leak into the final inductor. Note that this is only an issue if you want, say, >60dB isolation. If you want 100dB stop band attenuation then torroidal inductors with shielding between filter stages would be needed.<br><br>TL;DR go ahead and try air cored inductors but if the circuit doesn<sq>t operate as desired (oscillator drift, poor filter attenuation, noise pickup from nearby electronics etc) then torroidal (or other shielded geometries) inductors will likely improve things.<br><br>NB<colon> The only disadvantage of ferrite cored inductors is that if the core saturates the inductor becomes strongly non-linear. This can introduce distortion (harmonics or IMD) as it causes the inductance value to change with instantaneous inductor current. This is typically only an issue in RF circuits for high power filters (ie<colon> after a 100W power amp).

Yes, more than one multimeter is VERY useful but you didn<sq>t ask for advice on that.<br><br>Honestly, a solid performing dual channel power supply will be INFINITELY more useful than a scope. Quite simply, there is just more that you can do with a well built PS, it is more fundamental to doing electronics. You can often work around having a scope by using other methods. You seldom can work around having a reliable power supply. I strongly dislike ATX conversions for a variety of reasons. First, they are seldom properly current limited (some can source enough current to start a fire) and second they have VERY high ripple for a power supply, usually in the tens or more of mV. It can actually get even worse for certain types of loads. This ripple can manifest itself in all sort of instability in your circuits. You can look at used power supplies from companies like HP, Power Designs, Sorrenson, Lambda, Thurlby Thander(sp?) etc. Most will be old and have analog dials but they will have proper current limiting, proper voltage regulation and reasonable accuracy. Do NOT go with one of the cheap power supplies from China. They have huge problems with turn on spikes and overshoot (which can kill your circuit). Why dual channel? So that you can provide both a positive and negative voltage for op-amp work/learning.<br><br><br>Having said EVERYTHING I said above, I am going to completely switch gears here and recommend something you likely hadn<sq>t encountered. Since you are a poor student, you should look into the Digilent Analog Discovery. This device combines a low power dual channel power supply, 30Mhz usb oscilloscope, logic analyzer and function generator into one device for under $200 for students (see the following link). National Instruments just acquired Digilent and the never [version 2](http<colon>//sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/213328) adds a few slight enhancements (named adjustable voltages on the power supply and the ability to source more current). These devices are NOT as capable as any individual device. For exanple, the oscilloscope is not as powerful as a Rigol DS1054Z, but it is good enough. The power supply is not as capable as a standalone dual channel PSU (it is too low power) but it is good enough for learning. The logic analyzer isn<sq>t as powerful as a Salae Logic 16 but it does well enough for analyzing the digital circuits you will encounter as a student. Same with the frequency generator, it is not as powerful as a stand alone Freq Gen, but it is good enough to do quite a lot actually. It sounds like I am trashing this device but I am actually not, because the power comes in the ways that you can integrate all of these parts. For example, one user has made a full featured [impedance analzyer](http<colon>//www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/impedance-analyzer-build-and-experiments/msg603602/#msg603602) (for measuring the properties of capcitive and inductive networks from DC to 20MHz). This ability alone is only found in devices above $1000. He also made an [audio analysis suite](http<colon>//www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/analog-disovery-as-audio-analyzer/) with THD performance down to 0.01<percent> if I remember correctly. Quite simply, this is a VERY useful device for a hobbyist at an affordable price point (plus it is small so it saves a LOT of space in the dorm room. By the time you out-grow this device, you will have time, the knowledge and finances to figure out HOW you should expand your instrument purchases.<br><br></p>",

We have coffee, tea, and Mountain Dew.<br><br>Your question is basically asking us to download a first semester electronics course in a reddit comment, but I<sq>ll see what I can do.<br><br>**Clock speed**<br><br>Your Arduino has a 16MHz clock, which means 16 million times a second the oscillator will complete a transition from logic <sq>low<sq> (binary zero, or zero volts with respect to ground) to logic <sq>high<sq> (usually 3.3V or 5V with respect to ground) and back again.  This oscillator is tied to the Atmega328 chip at the heart of your Arduino, and tells it to <dq>do the next thing<dq>, or more specifically to perform the next instruction in memory.  Each <dq>thing<dq> is very simple, usually just adding numbers or moving them around, but it can do so VERY QUICKLY.  <br><br>**Main Loop**<br><br>Your main loop is written in C, which as u/iRobinHood has already said means that it gets reduced down to a number of individual instructions.  Each C command is *compiled* down to one or more machine instructions, and each of *those* takes one or more clock cycles to complete.  So your <sq>main<sq> loop may take a long time to complete, or it may be very quick - that<sq>s entirely dependent upon your specific program.<br><br>**Wavelength** <br><br>This term describes a repeating signal, but doesn<sq>t really apply to what you<sq>re doing; the term you<sq>re looking for is *frequency*.  <br><br>Typical signals are sine waves (a line that smoothly rises up to a maximum and then dips down to a minimum, and repeats - like waves on an ocean) and square waves (a bit going from, say, 0V to 5V and back again, over and over).  <br><br>*Frequency* is the measurement of how many times that signal repeats itself in one second.  The units are Hz.  Your oscillator<sq>s *frequency* is 16 MHz.  The LED<sq>s frequency is whatever you coded it to be.  On your scope, figure out how long it takes the LED<sq>s voltage signal to complete one cycle, you have its period.  Take 1 divided by that number (invert it), and you have your frequency.  As an example - if it takes 10ms total to complete the <dq>on<dq> and <dq>off<dq> parts of the cycle, it<sq>s got a 10ms *period*.  1 / 10ms = 1 / 0.01 sec = 100Hz.  You will not see this with the naked eye, it<sq>ll just look a bit dim.<br><br>**The Oscilloscope**<br><br>Things are not <dq>in tune<dq> with the scope.  For a digital scope, they<sq>re just insanely fast.  They measure the voltage on the scope probe at frequencies on the order of *gigahertz*, and simply plot those values on the screen.  Plot enough values and you can get some nice smooth looking waveforms.  It<sq>s a trick of digital electronics - do digital stuff fast enough and it looks analog.<br><br>**8-bit data**<br><br>This is an entirely different question, unrelated to the clock, the scope, or even the main loop.  This has to do with how data is stored and used within the chip itself.  An 8-bit chip has circuitry to work on 8-bit numbers, and that<sq>s it.  Larger numbers are handled in multiple math operations, again - tricks of digital electronics.  8-bit chips are cheap and easy to use, but they have their limitations.  16- or 32-bit chips exist for the hobby market, are typically far faster, and can handle math operations on these larger numbers in single clock cycles.  <br><br>If you<sq>re really curious about how your specific chip handles its memory organization, maps memory to I/O pins, or deals with register data, you<sq>ll need to read the user manual.  This is not a trivial thing, but it<sq>s the best source of information to general questions like this.<br><br>I hope that helps!  </p>",

These often need to go in first so you can solder them quickly, and so avoid overheating them.<br><br>The main things to remember are flux and confidence. Once you apply heat to a leg, either get it soldered or back off and leave it to cool for a minute or so. Flux will help with this a lot. A lot of new solderers do the tap-tap-tap game. This heats the leg and burns off the flux, without getting hot enough to get a good joint. By the time they get it up to temperature, the joint is half dry (due to crud building up within it) and the component is being cooked.<br><br>Press firmly on the pad touching the leg, apply solder (with flux) and hold till it wicks up.

                "answer": "<p>I think another (somewhat different) answer to your question has to do with serdes (Serializer/Deserializer) systems. Both your CPU and PCIe run off the same master clock, usually 100.000MHz. The CPU has its own PLL that brings it up to its 3GHz or so, hence the clock multiplier that you can configure in high-end/non-OEM motherboards. The PCIe (as well as other interfaces like 10GigE and XFP+) has its own PLL that locks onto that clock. Note that PCIe sends a clock signal and a data signal (1 differential pair per lane), and on the other end is another PLL that the receiver uses to synchronize its own clock. That way you can get rid of any small phase or frequency differences between the clock generators on the motherboard and say video card. The PCIe takes in parallel data and serializes it to send at a much higher data rate using fewer physical signal lines. Your little cell phone camera also has a little SerDes chip in it as well so you<sq>re not routing 30-some signal lines to your phone<sq>s main board.</p>",

In case you were curious why<colon><br><br>Realistically, your only limitations would be the gauge of the wire not being able to handle the current, your power supply not being able to handle the connected load, or you tripping a breaker. I<sq>m assuming you<sq>re referring to typical wall power when you say power supply, so you won<sq>t have to worry about not being able to supply the demand. If not, you can simply find the max output specs on it (in amps). During hurricane Sandy last year we had to figure out what could and couldn<sq>t be handled by our diesel generator based on the specs of all the devices we would consider plugging into it. Be careful with power supplies like this though. <br><br>If you wanted to crunch the numbers and see how everything stacks up, you can probably also get the <dq>max load<dq> capacity (in amps) on the amplifier and keyboard. The keyboard should be minimal. I<sq>m not too familiar with audio electronics but a given 1000W amplifier should only draw ~8 amps at 120VAC (what comes out of the wall) at *full output* (1000W/120V=about 8.3A). Power in Watts = Volts * Amps. Full output means pushing the device to its absolute limits. You won<sq>t be doing that or else that would be one odd wedding. At least it would keep the grandparents awake. A typical circuit breaker amperage for the outlet like the one it<sq>s going to be plugged into is probably 10 or 15 amps, which you wouldn<sq>t have to worry about tripping (by exceeding it). Your chosen extension cord<sq>s wire gauge can handle 15 amps, so you<sq>re good in that department as well.<br><br>A short would trip the breaker, but the only way I see that happening is if Helen<sq>s damn kid Gregory wasn<sq>t waddling around the party pouring his sippy cup everywhere, especially on the spot where you have the two extension cords connected to each other.

                "answer": "<p>Yes you can. Two diodes will get you to approx. 3.6 volts. As others have said, the voltage drop varies with current. If your device is fairly steady with its current draw, you can check the data sheet to find the voltage drop at the exact current. Your device takes 1 watt, and so draws current = 1W/3.6V = 278mA. Using the datasheet from Diodes, we find the drop is 0.8V from the If vs. Vf graph. This means your voltage out will be closer to 3.4V, so verify your device can operate at this voltage input from the datasheet. Your diodes will consume power = 0.8V * 278mA = 222mW. <br><br>To calculate if the 4007 can handle this, again we find the datasheet, here<sq>s an example from the company Diodes<colon><br>http<colon>//www.diodes.com/datasheets/ds28002.pdf<br><br>The current is rated at 1A, so you are good there. Now the power.<br>We have thetaJA=100C/W, and a max junction temp of 150C. What this means if you are sitting in a room at 27C, and put 222mW through the diode, the junction temp = 27 + 0.222 * 100 = 49.2C. This is well below the max junction temp so you are good to go!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>It actually discusses the real reason but doesn<sq>t really say it in detail.  I<sq>ve posted this before but here is more detail<colon><br><br>Regular silicon diodes are also exponential so this isn<sq>t really the whole reason.  <br><br>The actual reason comes from LEDs being III-V semiconductor-based.  Things like electron mobility and such have temperature coefficients that cause them to increase current even with only increasing temperature.  Because passing an operating current through them also heats them, they are prone to <dq>thermal runaway<dq>.  <br><br>Silicon does the opposite until you reach avalanche breakdown which is generally not a normal operating mode (excepting diodes specifically design for that).  So thermal effects are generally <dq>self-limiting<dq> within the normal operating range for a silicon device.<br><br>Compounding that problem is the fact that LEDs have typically (especially for recent high output LEDs) very delicate [heterojunction](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterojunction) structures with very small dimensions (given the power they pass) which can be damaged by heat.  This means their failure mechanism are greatly accelerated by heat more than typical [homojunction](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homojunction) (normal PN diode) silicon technology like a standard CMOS transistor used in  common digital circuits.<br><br>Because the heat is proportional to power dissipation, and power dissipation is proportional to primarily current (since voltage is more or less a <dq>diode drop<dq> due to the exponential), limiting current means limiting heat that triggers thermal runaway and causes device failure.<br><br>So the limiting resistor is about prolonging the life of the LED.  The key is to understand the acceleration is exponential as well so you can exponentially reduce the device lifetime with a very small change in current.  20+ years lifetime can be reduced to 1-2 years very easily.<br><br>Strictly resistors also have temperature coefficients as well so there are apocryphal stories about early LED-based street lights in southern California that had >50<percent> failure rates in the first year - they had resistor current limiting and operated in high ambient temperatures so the current rose to accelerating levels anyway.  They probably picked the low bid supplier and got what they deserved.<br><br>A better way to maximize life that accounts for ambient temperature is to use a LED driver IC which has a band-gap reference and which current limits using a switching power supply.  These will tend to control the current far better over temperature.<br><br>For hobby stuff lifetime probably doesn<sq>t matter so much and you are less likely to use the circuit in extreme environments (i.e. outdoors) so it<sq>s often just easier to use a resistor.</p>",

You would be amazed at the number of people that have the same problem understanding the meaning of the word ground as it relates to different systems. Do not try and compare the meaning of ground in one type of system to the meaning of ground in a different type of system. Study the meaning of ground in EACH type of system separately. In an AC system ground is a secondary return path used only for safety reasons and DOES NOT normally carry voltage or current and is not part of the main power.

Their output is used to make a crystal oscillate and the phase difference creates a control voltage for said VCO. However if the crystal oscillator (or whatever input you use) does not match the VCO the PLL will never lock properly and you get erratic (non-defined) behaviour.<br><br>The microcontrollers manual tells you what range of oscillators you may use for the input.

You want your elevator to start without a jerk and smoothly stop at the floor without overshooting? PID. You want to keep a boiler at a constant temperature even as cool water is added or just sitting there leaking heat? PID.<br><br>Think about bringing a large boat into a dock. You don<sq>t want to creep slowly towards the dock but you don<sq>t want to slam into the dock - you need to control your motion of the huge mass carefully - probably choose roughly how fast to approach the dock, and how much reverse thrust, without overdoing it each way. The boat is a difficult case because it<sq>s underpowered compared to the mass. <br><br>Cruise control is another example - here PID is used to keep a constant speed in the face of changing load - going up a hill or down a hill will change the amount of power required from the engine. Poorly tuned systems will apply power when they detect it is needed but this leads to a problem of lag - if you apply power at the start of a hill, the delay between power applied and increased speed may cause the car to overshoot the target speed. A PID algorithm in the speed control will anticipate approaching the target speed and smoothly decrease the power applied to avoid overshooting. Mistuned, the algorithm may undershoot, leading to reapplying power and making it more likely to overshoot.<br><br>Oscillations around set points is common in untuned systems.

Someone like this guy<colon> http<colon>//vimeo.com/41401404<br><br><br><br><br>Let<sq>s say I had this problem and I found better pictures to figure out correct and precise placement. I *could* use a hot glue gun with a tiny tip, and tweezers, but, I<sq>ll also need a pair of optivisors to make sure I didn<sq>t break the leads. Ultimately the optivisors will be used to make sure I am placing the SMDs precisely where they need to be. I<sq>ll more than likely also need to bend/reset the leads/pins. I would do this oh so very delicately or I know they<sq>ll break off. I wouldn<sq>t user my finger nails I would use a pair of tweezers for this. Once I am sure they will make contact with the board again, I need to make sure the board doesn<sq>t move while doing all of this. I would place the board on a nonslip fabric, maybe a towel, laid out on a table. I like lot<sq>s of room when I do this kind of stuff, it<sq>s the only way to make sure I don<sq>t mess up. I<sq>ve tried doing repairs in my lap while sitting on my bed, incredibly bad idea that was. Now I use a table. I even have a large piece (24 in. W x 48 in.) of MDF just for this stuff. So I<sq>d use a full towel laid out on a hard flat level surface and it would even be taped it down, or tacked down to that surface. Then I would place the board and the SMDs in the middle of the towel, with my tweezers. so I don<sq>t have to worry about dropping anything and spending the next half hour+ like a crackhead exploring the ghetto. Now I have the ability to lean in really close and hold myself still with my elbows, reinforcing my ability to keep my hands still and precision. Next I would tape the board to the fabric. I wouldn<sq>t use anything too sticky because I don<sq>t want anything else pulled off the board. I might use a bunch of scotch tape, but I notice there are grounding holes in the board so I might take the opportunity to tack the board down through those holes, as long as I knew the tacks wouldn<sq>t damage the board, I just need to make sure the board doesn<sq>t move around, at all. It needs to be completely stationary. Because I<sq>ll need to precisely, slightly and delicately press the SMDs down with my tweezers in my left hand while managing 1 drop of hot glue for each. I need this to be pin point accuracy, and I can<sq>t allow any amount of the hot glue to get underneath the SMD before it sets. Hot glue is an insulator, a great insulator, so if any of the hot glue gets underneath the SMDs, well, I won<sq>t know where the problem is when I put everything back together... So I need to make sure I have constant pressure on the chip while the hot glue is laid. While I<sq>m laying this 1 drop of hot glue, I want to go around the SMD in a <dq>backwards C<dq> movement, then quickly close it. I can<sq>t let the tip of the gun touch the SMDs or I might accidentally push the glue under it. I<sq>m right handed so I<sq>m holding down the SMD with the tweezers in my left hand, the technique or movement is akin to a <dq>backwards C<dq> becuase I<sq>m going around the SMD. All with just the minute amount of 1 single drip of hot glue. I need to make sure the hot glue is as hot as possible during this so it flows and forms a bond with the sides of SMD and the board. This is why I use that tiny tip. I use a cheap hobby hot glue gun with the tiniest tip. (*I don<sq>t use superglue, it<sq>s so thin it will wander underneath the SMDs* and be impossible to save.)<br><br><br><br><br>Once I<sq>m finished with all 3 SMDs, I would go back and put 1 more drop on each. Since I know the SMD is held down already, I also know I can seal the deal, making sure each has a nice complete coating. When I<sq>m doing this, I know just this next drop is going to partially melt the cooled hotglue, this is turn will seal the sides to the top of the SMD, since the surface of the board is going to keep the glue attached to it cooler, it will reinforce the *weld* on the sides. Helping it to form a nice little blob. Any more hot glue than that, may interfere with the space constraints. If I do this just right, I know the hot glue will also help to hold the SMD in place when it<sq>s all put back together.<br><br><br><br><br>Now, you and any others may be curious as to the measurement of what a drop of hot glue is. Well, it<sq>s easy. After you plug in the hot glue gun, and let it sit for it to heat up. After maybe 10-20 minutes at some point it will start leaking. The leaks will form the exact size of the drop of hot glue I<sq>ve been speaking of.<br><br><br><br><br>Also, if my optivisors were MIA in this instance, I could get away with using a cheap magnifying glass taped or hot glued to the bottom of a well selected cup, turned upside down.

If using dual supplies, place two.<br><br>* Place test points everywhere.  A 35 mil plated hole with 10 mil annular ring is a good size.  You can fit a scope probe in it, and it will hold itself in place.  If you get in a pinch, you can also solder to it.<br><br>* Place several 0.1<dq> headers around the board connected to ground.  You can attach the scope grounds to these.<br><br>* Label your test points with text on the silkscreen layer.<br><br>* If using >2 layers, try to avoid routing signals on the inner layers.  Reserve the inner layers for power and ground.  You can<sq>t fix traces on inner layers with a razorblade.<br><br>* Place large electrolytic capacitors on the main DC power input to the board.  This will provide decoupling from any long wires you use to connect the board to power externally.<br><br>* Pay attention to how much heat ICs generate.  All ICS will tell you (1) how much power they dissipate and (2) their thermal resistance to ambient.  From these numbers you can calculate a temperature rise.  You probably don<sq>t want anything running more than 50 to 60 deg C.  If an IC is available in a special thermal package, odds are that<sq>s the one you<sq>ll want, and you should connect the thermal pad to the ground plane (if electrically possible) or an appropriate heatsink.<br><br>* Lean toward smaller resistor values.  Almost all opamps can drive 10 kOhm at resonable voltage swings.  A lot of them can drive even less.  Smaller resistances make the circuit less sensitive to capacitive loads, which can cause stability problems.\r\rEdit<colon>\r\r* Terminate any inputs to your board with resistors to ground or an appropriate input level. Use 50 ohms for RF or 10 kOhm or so for low frequency analog. This will make sure your opamps on your board aren<sq>t railing out when you have no input connected.  Don<sq>t do this if your signal source is high impedance, e.g., condenser mic.\r\r* Put resistors in series with analog drivers. 50 ohm for RF, less for low frequency. A small 10 or 20 ohm resistor in series with amplifier outputs can prevent them from oscillating with large capacitive loads (cables). Keep in mind that you don<sq>t want to do this if driving very low impedance loads due to the voltage division.\r<br><br></p>",

For most LEDs with an absolute max of 30mA, 5-10mA is often enough to be visible, 20mA if you want it to be bright. If you need to go too close/beyond the absolute maximum rating to get the desired brightness, you<sq>ll want to get brighter LEDs instead. (LEDs have different brightnesses as a function of current, and a bunch of other characteristics, but you probably don<sq>t have this information if you got the LEDs at a hobby electronics store or something).<br><br>Also, you don<sq>t need the exact resistance calculated, as someone mentioned\u2014whatever value of resistance you use, you want it to a) allow a safe current to pass through the LED (preferably with some headroom, since LEDs and resistors both have tolerances); b) light the LED brightly enough.<br><br>I don<sq>t know what source voltage you<sq>re using, so I have no idea whether the 56\u03a9 is calculated at absolute max or a lower value.

                "answer": "<p>Let<sq>s take a look at the most basic requirements<colon><br><br>1. Let<sq>s assume that you will be using Red LEDs. Different LEDs will have different voltage drops across them. That is, to turn them on you will need at least Vd potential across each LED. Red LEDs require 2V, others may require more. <br><br>2. In addition to voltage, you will also need to provide a constant current. The current is really what controls the brightness. I usually work with anywhere from 5mA - 20mA for my work. Let<sq>s assume 20mA. *You* will need to control the current the LED consumes -- you can do this via resistors or transistors.<br><br>3. From the physics of the problem we can see that each LED will consume Power = Voltage * Current = 2V * 0.02A = 40mW. Multiply that by 1500 and you are looking at 60W. From there, you will have to power those lights for 5 hours -- 300 watt-hours. Let<sq>s add 10<percent> energy conversion overhead -- 330 watt-hours. <br><br>4. Batteries are usually spec<sq>d in milliamp-hours and have an output voltage. Multiply their charge (mA-hours) and output voltage (Volts) and you get energy (watt-hours). (Simplified) Find a battery whose energy capacity is >= 330 watt-hours.<br><br>5. You will have to decide what topology you want for your LEDs. You can arrange the LEDs in series, parallel or a combination of the two. The LEDs in series will require 20mA of current and 3000V across all LEDs. In parallel, they will require 2V across them and 30A (!) of current. Read into current limiting resistors and using BJTs for current limiting. <br><br>6. To really make this project efficient you will need to investigate buck and/or boost converters to regulate current and convert the voltage from the battery to another level. Take a look at some [LED drivers](http<colon>//www.ti.com/general/docs/gencontent.tsp?contentId=28887) from Texas Instruments.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>You know, the one thing I would warn you about this is that it looks like those coils are meant for fairly low voltage and high current drive signals. It looks like each actuator only has 40 turns on the electromagnet (about 10 per leg per side, and there are two legs and two sides). So you<sq>d want to measure the resistance of one actuator with your multimeter, and figure out what a reasonable voltage is. You could probably try increasingly large numbers of AA batteries in series until you could get one of the pixels to flip back and forth, and then add 20-40<percent> more voltage for a safety factor. Make sure you<sq>re driving the things through the intended diodes, so that voltage drop is factored in as well.<br><br> Then you<sq>d divide the voltage by the measured coil resistance to get the current that your driver/drive transistors would need to handle.<br><br>My very, very rough estimation of those coils (based on a lot of guesswork) is that you<sq>ll find the actuators to be about 2 ohms each. You<sq>ll probably find that you need at least one amp to get the actuator to flip (this is even more of a guess than the coil resistance). The diode burns maybe 1V at that current, so you<sq>d expect to need maybe 3V.<br> <br>I<sq>d definitely start as low as 1.5V, to be safe, and only apply the voltage briefly. [Those diodes](http<colon>//www.vishay.com/docs/88711/s1.pdf) can only handle 1A safely for extended durations. Although they can handle as much as 10A for a tenth of a second (see fig 6), and as much as 20A for 0.01 seconds, so this doesn<sq>t really clue you in as to how much drive is needed.<br><br>Let me know what you find out, I always like seeing if my guesswork is near to the mark!</p>",

This 240v single phase is connected to a center tapped transformer, where the middle is grounded. You might hear this referred to as a split-phase system. Between the ground and either end of the transformer is 120v, and between both ends of the transformer is 240v. But, they come from 1 single phase. The middle of this transformer, which is grounded, is connected to your neutral wire.<br><br>So, now you have 3 wires. 2 wires are carrying 120v (with respect to neutral), and the neutral wire, which is grounded. The 2 120v wire are 180 degree out of phase, since you tap them from opposite ends of the transformer. This does something pretty cool...<br><br>Say you take your first 120v wire and nuetral, and connect some load to it. Now take the OTHER 120v wire and nuetral, and connect an EQUAL load to it. This is called a <sq>balanced<sq> load. Both of the wires will draw the same current, but 180 degrees out of phase from each other.<br><br>While you will get the entire current going down each 120v wire (the <sq>hot<sq> wires), when both currents RETURN down the SAME nuetral wire, the currents will add together and cancel (think of 180 degrees as being a minus sign). You get 0 current through the nuetral! <br><br>Now, your loads are never balanced, so you WILL get current through the neutral wire, but it should be minimal, since the currents will at least cancel out partially. Also, since your neutral wire is grounded, its at ground voltage. Again, it will be at some non-zero voltage since the wire travels some distance from where its grounded, but it will be small.<br><br>These two characteristics, small current and near-ground voltage, make it a relatively safe wire. You still shouldn<sq>t grab one until you have measured the current and voltage, since there could be a large difference in the current going through both hot wires, or a fault somewhere.

Figure out your actual absolutely minimum specs (preferably via evaluation of existing COTS devkits or boards, not from numbers pulled out of your ass) and shop those specs around to TI, Broadcom, NXP, Freescale, ST, Samsung, etc and see what they have for you.  Getting in touch with an Arrow / Avnet rep is probably a good idea, too.  Be weary of companies like Samsung - their own business comes first, so you<sq>ve gotta be ready to eat long lead times if you buy from them.  <br><br>Once you have prelim pricing on all your chips in volume, you<sq>re gonna have to make it lower.

Tier-1 CMs (Foxconn, Jabil, Flextronics, etc) will be hard to deal with if your volumes aren<sq>t huge and consistent, but tier-2 CMs don<sq>t have the same leverage, buying power, and muscle that they do.  Choosing the wrong CM can completely fuck you, so talk to people with experience and choose wisely.  Expect to go to China (Shenzhen) at least twice during this process, and consider working with someone like Dragon Innovation to help you pick partners.  <br><br>Once you<sq>ve picked your chip, designed your boards and picked your CM, you<sq>re almost good to go.  You<sq>ll have some finance stuff to figure out here and there, getting lines of credit with various vendors, etc, as well as some scheduling stuff (dealing with lead times, wrangling vendors, etc), but it usually isn<sq>t that bad.  Your engineers will need to design your production lines including bed of nails test fixtures and jigs, programming fixtures, burn-in fixtures and other final QC / eval test systems.

                "answer": "<p>There are too many variables to directly tell you why your usb dac sounds better. /u/MuffleTheFox gave one possibility - the on-board circuit is more noisy. But you didn<sq>t specify what do you mean by <dq>better<dq> - is it less noisy, is the base deeper, does it reproduce higher frequencies better?<br><br>DAC has 2 major properties - sample resolution (8, 10, 12, 16, 32 bit) and sample rate (24kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz). Sample resolution means how many voltage levels can your DAC output. Common audio goes from -1.2Vpp to 1.2Vpp for a total of 2.4 Volts. So if you have an 8-bit  DAC, it can output 256 descrete levels. 2.4 Vols / 256 Levels = 9.375 mV per level. That means if you pass, say value 127 into your DAC, it<sq>ll output 0V and if you output value 128 into your DAC, it<sq>ll output 0.009375 Volts and so on. Obviously, the more levels DAC can output, the smoother the <dq>jumps<dq> in voltage levels will be, the less noise you<sq>ll hear. <br><br>If you graph voltage over time of a DAC output (something that oscilloscope does), the bit-rate will directly affect the vertical resolution of your signal. <br><br>The sample rate is what affects the horizontal resolution on that graph - how many changes per second of your voltage levels can the DAC do. There<sq>s a special rate called the <dq>Nyquist rate<dq> which is double the frequency you want to reproduce. So if you want to reproduce 22kHz sound, your DAC MUST have a sample rate of 44kHz or higher. But even with sample rate of 96kHz, you<sq>ll run into the problem of alaising. It<sq>s the problem we meet when we convert a digital signal to analogue. DAC<sq>s output still looks like [this](http<colon>//www.ni.com/cms/images/devzone/tut/dhall_architecture_fig4.JPG) unless your bit-rate and sample-rate are very high. <br><br>So now you need to add anti-alaising filters to your DAC output. It can be a simple integrator. An integrator turns [square wave into triangular wave](http<colon>//www.electronicshub.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Input-and-Output-Waveforms-of-Integrator.jpg) and so if you choose your RC constants well, you can smooth out the square drops of the DAC to be smoother. <br><br>At this point you need to think of the <dq>colors<dq> of the sound you want to hear. Do you want bass enhancement? You then probably want to split your output, pass one feed through a low-pass filter and an amplifier, and then add it to the second output. Or maybe you want to do pre-processing on the digital side? Then before the bytes flow into your DAC you want to fourier transform them and adjust bass/treble to your liking.<br><br>Is you card going to output to a speaker, or to some amplifier first? If the former, then you want to build the amplifier in your circuit.<br><br>Now that we are getting the sound we like, we need to think about impedances. Most op-amps have great isolation, so we don<sq>t really need to think about signal degrading through resistance. But now we have ear-phones or head-phones or speaker. They all have different resistance values. Do you know/remember what a voltage divider is? Well I have bad news for you, because your amplifier reduces down to a resistor, and your speaker is already a resistor, and the only way to make sure that the voltage that is passed through your speaker is the best possible - we need to make sure that our amplifier reduces down to the same-value resistor. (In voltage divider, if 2 resistors are the same, both get 1/2 voltage, but if they are not, higher resistance one gets more voltage)<br><br>Oh, and the noise /u/MuggleTheFox mentioned can creep in at any point of this circuit.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>To start, let<sq>s try to come up with some specific criteria for <dq>Sounds better.<dq> What do you (think you) mean by that? <br><br>Once you<sq>ve come up with specific criteria, the next step is to figure out how to translate that into measurable qualities. To do so, you<sq>ll probably benefit from looking at what<sq>s been learned in decades of research into the physiology and psychoacoustics of human auditory perception. I<sq>m not 100<percent> sure, but I<sq>m guessing that hydrogenaud.io would probably be a good starting point for finding resources and asking questions.<br><br>I only have passing familiarity with the subject matter myself, but I know enough to make the same guess Hexorg made, that at least part of your personal definition of better is<colon> more bass. I guessed as much because most people recognize and favor boosted bass. More subtle, if the bass is weak, people think things sound better if the high end also rolls off a bit.<br><br>You are asking in an electronics forum for help explaining the electronics of why your motherboard sound card sounds worse to you than your USB sound card. That<sq>s a reasonable thing to do, and its reasonable and expected that people are answering in those terms. Those answers are fine, as far as they go.<br><br>It<sq>s true that audio codecs on motherboards can be subject to a noisier environment than an external USB DAC. That might even be the problem you are having, but I doubt it. Its possible for motherboard designers to screw up motherboard audio to varying degrees, but its also possible for them to get it right. In fact, compared to many of the signals slung around on a motherboard, like communications with DDR3 RAM, or PCIe, or SATA, or WiFi, USB, or Gigabit ethernet, maintaining the integrity of an stereo audio signal is pretty tame. At the same time, USB is, itself, a potential source of interference; the signaling lines swing ~2v, with sharp edges; and it is all happening within milimeters of analog circuitry in a USB DAC<br><br>Sample rates and resolutions *could* have an impact. Whether they actually do is another matter. Human hearing is the real limit at this point, and all things being equal, the CD audio standard of 16-bit samples at 44KHz per channel is enough to accurately reproduce anything any human can hear, and even if it weren<sq>t, the differences between it and higher sample rates of bit depths would be incredible subtle, subtler than things like whether you had a little drainage in your eustacian tubes from a low-level viral infection or allergy. <br><br>And, BTW, thinking of 24 or 32-bit DACs as creating smoother waveforms than a 16-bit DAC is misleading. All DACs have reconstruction filters that emit smooth waveforms. The stairstepped figure Hexorg linked to is actually an example of the sample-and-hold step used by some analog to digital converters. It<sq>s also what an intermediate stage of of a, oh, ~4-bit DAC would look like before the reconstruction filters. <br><br>Now, that isn<sq>t to say that we have always been good at capturing and encoding digital audio, or that CD players were always good at reproducing it, but at this point, digital-to-analog conversion at audio frequencies is pretty much a non-issue these days, and has been for the better part of a decade. It<sq>s entirely possible that your motherboard maker skimped on the audio codec and supporting circuitry, but again, its may be entirely up to the job.<br><br>Impedance differences can lead to reduced signal levels, but a USB DAC could easily have the same problem.<br><br>I<sq>d step back from explanations in the domain of electronics, and instead look to the pragmatic considerations of commerce and psychology.<br><br>Why did you buy an external USB sound card in the first place? Why did you spend $50 dollars on one? Something convinced you that spending $50 was going to result in an improvement, and having done so, you are going to be predisposed to 1) hearing a difference, 2) favoring the sound of your new purchase. <br><br>Oh, but that<sq>s not all. The maker of the USB dongle is going to want to make sure you feel like you<sq>ve gotten your money<sq>s worth. Since bad audio codec chips are rare these days, and since the average $~4 audio codec chip these days is really good at reproducing the digital audio played through it, they don<sq>t have much they can do. <br><br>If they provide a good DAC, chances are you won<sq>t notice, because chances are, you already have a good DAC. If they provide a DAC with superior specs, chances are you won<sq>t notice either, because those superior specs will likely be outside of perception. Besides, while such chips exist, but they tend to be expensive, both because don<sq>t sell well (for obvious reasons), and also because the only people who buy them tend to not to be price sensitive, or may actually think more $$ = better.<br><br>They might include something like a small headphone driver. That could actually be genuinely useful AND noticeable. If nothing else a USB sound card with a headphone driver is pretty certain to sound louder at the same system volume setting though headphones or an amp compared to a motherboard sound card with no such circuitry.<br><br>Another thing they can do is actually use a worse DAC, that is to say, a DAC that doesn<sq>t accurately reproduce the digital audio played through it. That<sq>s likely to be noticed, and if they do things like, oh, boosting the bass, there is a good chance that it will be noticed and judged to sound better. Chances are though, on a $50 USB sound card, they aren<sq>t actually using a worse DAC, they are using a good DAC with a DSP and using the DSP to change the audio. Or, perhaps they got you to install their proprietary driver and other software, any of which could be processing the audio before playback. You probably have to spend 5-10x as much to actually buy a DAC that implements its <dq>enhancements<dq> outside the digital domain.<br><br>All that said, I<sq>m pretty sure that I didn<sq>t really answer your question, so, let me try again...<br><br>Most of what makes a DAC good is more than half a century of R&D, and particularly, a few decades of consumer digital audio. That, plus probably less than $10 (in quantities of 1000 or more) in readily available parts goes a long way to creating a good quality sound card<br><br>There is, of course, a little more to it than that. You<sq>ll have to select the parts, starting with the DAC chip, but that doesn<sq>t have to be a very involved decision (TI, or Cirrus Logic probably have what you need). Having chosen the chip, you start with the manufacturer<sq>s reference design for the chip you<sq>ve chosen. You choose supporting components, again, it doesn<sq>t have to be a very involved decision. You design and make a circuit board and assemble some finished boards. Next, you test it, review the results, if there are deficiencies, you revise your design and repeat the process.<br><br>At some point, you decide things are good enough. If you are designing a general purpose motherboard with audio that is mostly going to be used for system sounds, skype calls and playing back low-quality cat videos, your standards may be a bit lower, and you might worry less over component substitutions at manufacturing. If you are designing something that people are going to be more discerning about, you<sq>ll have higher standards before finalizing the design, and higher standards for manufacturing and QA. If a typhoon causes a delay in delivery of the proper capacitors, you won<sq>t go ahead with a substitution without testing them.<br><br>If you want more details, you can read about the process of [developing the ODAC](http<colon>//nwavguy.blogspot.com/search/label/ODAC<percent>20USB<percent>20DAC). I<sq>d also suggest the forums at http<colon>//diyaudio.com for discussion of the impact of certain design and implementation decisions on the character of audio, though I<sq>ll warn you that some of the folks there have one foot firmly in group and self-delusion. <br><br>Oh, outside digital domain tweaks, and including a headphone driver, one simple thing that can cause obvious audible differences is undersized caps on outputs.</p>",

But I<sq>d also assume you won<sq>t get 100<percent> of the energy onto it, and it won<sq>t absorb all of it.  But as approximations go, that<sq>s a starting place.  [edit] additionally, come to think of it, a mosquito<sq>s largest surface area is its wings and those are probably easier to burn.  so it may be a lot less.<br><br>Of course, keeping a laser aimed at a mosquito for 1S is really really hard.  If this were my project, I<sq>d figure out how to do that with a $1 red 5mW laser before even considering lethal options.  In fact unless your tracking system is dependent on the laser illumination I<sq>d test it with no laser at all.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Most people use microcontroller and microprocessor interchangeably, but there is a difference. <br><br>Microprocessors aren<sq>t really used anymore, they<sq>re basically a CPU. There isn<sq>t any RAM or memory in a microprocessor, you need to add them in separate ICs. <br><br>Microcontrollers are a microprocessor with all the useful bits added to the same package. They have RAM, memory, I/O controllers, peripherals, etc. You just need to throw that one IC on a board and you<sq>re ready to use it. The Texas Instruments MSP430 line, Atmel ATmega328 and Microchip PIC line are all microcontrollers. There are thousands if not millions of microcontrollers to choose from. <br><br>An Arduino is a microcontroller development board. It<sq>s a generic board with an Atmel microcontroller and some extra circuitry so you can prototype something without needing to build a new board and assemble it yourself. It has the microcontroller, power regulators, indicator LEDs, a second microcontroller so you can program it through USB, etc. You can get development boards for most lines of microcontrollers. If you<sq>ve never used a certain kind of microcontroller before, they<sq>re extremely useful; you can build a prototype without having to worry about any hardware issues around the micro. <br><br>As soon as you put a microcontroller or a computer *in* something, it is an embedded system. The circuit board in a Kurig is an embedded system. They can be small and run from a tiny microcontroller or they can be big and run from a 64-bit computer. Basically if it makes up the brains of a stand alone system and isn<sq>t being used as a generic desktop PC, it<sq>s an embedded system; however, they tend to run off microcontrollers and have much lower power than a PC. An embedded system will be designed and optimized for one specific application. <br><br>A Raspberry Pi is another development board. It<sq>s powered by an ARM microcontroller. ARM microcontrollers are made by a variety of manufacturers, but have then same microprocessor inside them (ARM is basically electronic speak for <dq>really big and powerful microcontroller<dq>) The microcontroller on the Raspberry Pi is powerful enough that it can run a special version of Linux meant for ARM microcontrollers. Lots of people use them as tiny, low power PCs. Their power makes them very useful as embedded systems though. You can program it in Linux with just about any language you want, it has HDMI out, USB, tons of processing power, etc. If you wanted to build a robot with vision, the Raspberry Pi has USB to connect the camera and the processing power to do something with it; an Arduino does not. <br><br>The Raspberry Pi also highlights the grey area between PCs and embedded systems. If your Raspberry Pi boots to a desktop and you use it like a normal computer, I would argue that it isn<sq>t being used as an embedded system. If you use it to run a robot or specifically to run XBMC, I would say that it is an embedded system.</p>",

A transformer works by converting a voltage on the primary coil to a magnetic flux in the core, then back to a voltage on the secondary coil.  The magnetic flux in the core is a function of primary voltage and the number of turns.  Here is the relation<colon><br><br>flux ~ Voltage / number of turns<br><br>So if you increase the number of turns, the flux goes down.  If you increase voltage, flux goes up.  If you want to keep the flux constant, while increasing the voltage, you have to increase the number of turns.<br><br><br>This is important because a transformer<sq>s core can only handle a certain amount of flux.  If you exceed the saturation flux, your transformer will not work as advertised.  <br><br><br>Another very important factor when it comes to determining the number of turns is the inductance of the coil.   Lets say you want to make a power supply transformer that converts 120V to 12V.  What happens when the 12V side has no load while the power supply is plugged in?  In that case the transformer<sq>s primary coil acts as an inductor.  The inductance of the coil prevents large currents from flowing through the transformer.  The inductance of the coil is a function of the number of turns.  Here is the relation<colon><br><br>L ~ N^2<br><br>The current through the inductor is a function of inductance<colon><br><br>I ~ 1/L or I ~ 1/N^2<br><br>So that means that the current through the inductor goes up by a factor of 100 if you decrease the number of turns by a factor of 10.  If your wall transformer has too few turns, the current will cause it to heat up and you may start a fire.<br><br>**TLDR<colon>** If the number of turns is wrong, at best it won<sq>t work- at worst you burn your house down.</p>",

The magnetic field created by the primary is what causes currents in the secondary. As such, you want to couple that field to the secondary. If it goes outside of the transformer, you can waste energy in a variety of ways, cause interference, cause eddy currents and subsequently ohmic heating, in nearby conductors, etc.<br><br>The core is as important in transformer maths as the turns. You need to understand the mean magnetic path lengths, the permeability of the material, its BH curves, etc. Not terribly complicated, but somewhat obscure as far as typical EE knowledge goes.</p>",

In some cases, phasing is important, but not in this one.  <br><br>It is normal for a transformer to make a very quiet buzzing, but if it is making a loud buzzing, the transformer is likely saturating.  Applying too much voltage to a transformer will cause it to saturate.  When a transformer saturates, the current drawn by it increases sharply.

When given the option, that<sq>s just how people do it.<br><br>The fact that you have the transistor in the wrong place on the solenoid has already been noted.  The same situation applies<colon> as you have noted, NPN transistors are slightly cheaper or more capable, so we prefer to switch the low side if possible.<br><br>In the button, you know that you could delete the resistor and use the chip<sq>s built-in 33K pull-up resistors?  Just connect the button between ground and the I/O pin.<br><br>It<sq>s also common to have buttons active-low<colon> the button shorts to ground, with an opposing pull-up resistor.  That<sq>s mostly because ground is slightly more available than Vcc in an enclosure design; for example, it may be possible to connect to the chassis.  Or if the button is at the end of a long cable and someone cuts the cable, a short-circuit via the cutting blade is likely to be to ground.<br><br>Have you checked your voltage headroom margins?  The solenoid won<sq>t get all of your 5V supply, and as the drop across Q1 falls below 0.7V (4.3V across the solenoid), its beta falls off (saturation).  Is R3 chosen to produce the necessary base current?<br><br>Regarding the schematic choices, although I generally don<sq>t care for the everything-broken-up style, you<sq>ve got related functional blocks connected together so it<sq>s all quite clear.  And generally voltages arranged top-to-bottom.<br><br>You might want to put the Q1 label closer to Q1 than D1.<br><br>Assignment of functions to I/O pins is always interesting, especially when they<sq>re so limited.  Are you sure you don<sq>t want the button on PB5?  A reset button can be handy during development.<br><br>I see you have the reply solenoid on a pin which can be a timer PWM output.  This is good, because you might want to play with PWM on the solenoid control to vary the loudness of the knocks.<br><br>Oh, circuit-wise, some anti-reversal protection on the input, like a series Schottky diode, might be useful.</p>",

As /u/thwumpsauce pointed out, the Pi has a non-realtime OS with a ton of stuff you probably don<sq>t need.<br><br>IIRC, there were a couple of commercial devices out there which were basically Raspberry Pis wrapped up with a bit of software and some specialized hardware. But I bet you that you won<sq>t need that much CPU power to just log data and control relays.<br><br>---------<br><br>A realtime OS has precise control over every task. You know the OS will return to any function within a given number of miliseconds... or even microseconds. You have no assurances of that with Linux / Raspberry Pi. <br><br>In contrast, the much <dq>weaker<dq> AtMega328pb / Arduino (without an OS) will have **strict** guarantees on data-logging. Its a much simpler CPU and most instructions take exactly one clock-tick. Sure, 20MHz is much slower than the Pi<sq>s 1.2GHz, but the lower speed will save power **and** offers stronger guarantees on response times and whatnot.<br><br>Depending on what goes on with the Raspberry Pi, Linux might decide to switch to another task for up to 10ms!! Allegedly, worst-case kernel code may block for 100ms or even more! Therefore, there<sq>s no guarantee that your task will even run within a certain timeframe. Despite the huge CPU girth (1.2GHz)... Linux offers absolutely no guarantees to run your task with strict <dq>microsecond<dq> timing.<br><br>Other major pains are the Rasp. Pi<sq>s 16mA maximum source/sink current per pin (50mA throughout the device), and the lack of a Real Time Clock (RTC). On the first point, microcontrollers like AtMega328pb (aka<colon> Arduino) can supply 40mA per pin, and two sets of 100mA sets of ports (100mA drawn from Vcc and AVcc each). I<sq>m seeing that some relays are ~30mA or so, which is well beyond what a Pi can actually drive, so you need an external transistor while a uC will just drive the relay itself.<br><br>On the RTC / Real Time clock issue... if you want to shutdown power but still keep time... you<sq>ll need an external module to do that. In contrast, a simple dumb Microcontroller / Arduino can enter sleep-modes but wake up precisely each second (with aid of a 32.628 kHz crystal and a bit of configuration)... saving a gross amount of power (AtMega328pb draws less than 2uA in power-down mode... but the 32kHz XTAL is still active and counting!)<br><br>That<sq>s why the Pi is both ironically <dq>overpowered<dq> but also inadequate for the task. You probably don<sq>t need 1.2GHz for the task... but you need other things. Like the ability to drive higher currents from your GPIO pins, RTC (or RTC-like behavior), low-power sleep mode, and strict-guarantees on execution times.<br><br>The Pi is a good <dq>cheap computer<dq> though. So you can get your Ethernet connection, WiFi, HDMI, USB-ports for mouse or keyboard input, etc. etc. But I<sq>d say leave the data-logging and relay driving to lower-level microcontrollers.</p>",

The downside to this is if someone does notice that your product does not conform and you didn<sq>t test it and lied about it, you<sq>re in deep doo-doo.<br><br>Verification is actually having your PCB design tested with a certified testing house that will validate RF performance and leakage of your design. It will give you pass/fail data on whether or not your device conforms to FCC/IC/CE/etc... Assuming you pass, a test report will be generated and it can sit in your desk until someone asks for it. This will allow you to use the FCC/IC/CE marks without worrying about someone coming along later and getting you into trouble since it was the test lab that verified everything.<br><br>Also since you are still using a pre-certified module in your product, you still will need to do Unintentional radiator testing. This will validate other aspects of your design to make sure there is no leakage or parts behaving as an antenna, when they are not supposed to behave as an antenna. Usually the test lab will work with you to make sure you pass (they will basically spoon feed you). <br><br>EDIT<colon> I will add the unintentional radiator testing usually costs ~$2,000 and takes usually less than 5 days.

                "answer": "<p>**Short answer<colon> Yes**.<br><br>**Long answer<colon>**  There are a lot of companies you can pay to assemble boards for you.  They use a machine called a pick-and-place machine that has a robotic arm and will individually pick up a part and place it on the board for you.  The pick and place machines take a lot of effort to set up.  <br><br>For each type of part you have on your board you need to install one reel on the machine.  Most machines can only accommodate 20 reels at once, so if you have 21 types of parts then they will have to set up the machine once for the first 20 parts, then one more time for the 21st part, greatly increasing labor costs.<br><br>Also, each reel of parts might contain several thousand individual parts.  Lets say you only want to assemble 10 boards, and each board only has one 20k resistor on it.  You still have to buy a full reel of 3000 20k resistors.<br><br>This means that you should always try to reduce the number of part types.  In the example above it seems stupid to put a 20k resistor on the board when you can instead use two 10k resistors.  Unfortunately, it is not always clear where to draw the line.  Two resistors does take up more board area than one, and if board space is a huge concern then maybe you wan<sq>t to keep the 20k resistor.  Also, the cost of adding another reel to the machine will vary from place to place, and the number of reels that a pick and place machine holds is not always the same.  If you really want to know the marginal costs of adding another reel, you will need to contact your board assembly house and ask them yourself.</p>",

You can make series combination that can be stuffed with one or two parts if the pads are 90 degree symmetrical, or you do some ugly routing (pads in B-A-D-C order, with series parts in A-B and C-D, or one part stuffed A-D).<br><br>Basically, it<sq>s a tradeoff between the cost of mounting the reel on the pick & place (setup cost, and possibly capacity limits) and the cost of the pick and place machine time itself.<br><br>An SMT resistor costs about $0.0015 in bulk, which is damn close to negligible.  But the machine time to pick & place it will cost more like $0.015.  That<sq>s the extra cost to using multiple parts.<br><br>For resistors in particilar, assembly houses usually stock common values and so there<sq>s no cost to order and stock it.<br><br>But it still needs some administration, and to be pulled from stock, mounted on a feeder, and the feeder mounted on the machine.<br><br>That<sq>s a few dollars right there, which can pay for a thousand placements or so.<br><br>And if that one extra part type puts you over pick & place machine capacity, a saving can be extremely valuable.<br><br>So for runs of a few thousand, there<sq>s a cost savings.<br><br>When you get to really big scales (Apple, Nintendo, etc.), it<sq>s per-unit costs and assembly speed above all, so it<sq>s not generally done.</p>",

Alternatively, you could ask, <dq>for gate charge Q and risetime t, how much current do I need?<dq>, and the answer to that is a bit more straightforward, at least for a simplistic approximation.  <br><br>If you make the assumption that your gate is being charged and discharged by a constant current source/sink, and you have charge Q and risetime/falltime t, all you need to remember is that i(t) = dQ/dt, which simplifies to i = Q/t if i is constant.  <br><br>Of course, it<sq>s rarely the case that you have a constant-current device charging and discharging gates; it<sq>s usually more like a resistance (because a lot of gate drivers contain MOSFETs).  It<sq>s also not entirely accurate to think of MOSFET gates as just capacitors; the charge vs. voltage looks more like [this](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/IHbVeYf.png) (which is a snippet from [this datasheet](http<colon>//www.vishay.com/docs/91047/91047.pdf)).  Many MOSFET gate drivers will give peak current ratings based off of a completely discharged gate, but it<sq>s really at the flat portion (the Miller Plateau) and above that you want the most current.  <br><br>A better approximation is to model the gates and drivers as RC circuits.  From the datasheet, you can look at the gate charge vs. voltage graph and come up with a number for capacitance.  For example, for the graph I showed, if Vdd were 320 V, and Vgsmax were 15 V, that is about 35 nC, which can be modeled as a capacitor being charged to 15 V.  In this case, it<sq>s C = Q/V = (35 nC)/(15 V) = 2.3 nF.  Many gate driver datasheets will give Rout figures, which is part of the R in the RC circuit.  You must also factor in the gate resistance you<sq>re using, which will sum with this intrinsic R.  <br><br>As you probably know, risetime is usually given as the time it takes to get from 10<percent> to 90<percent> of the settled max, and that works out to somewhere between 2 and 3 RC time constants.  </p>",

The manual will show proper voltages/signals at various test points.  This will allow you to track the problem down to a module.  Once you have found the faulty module, the manual will provide the information required to find the faulty component.  Learning how to do repair, at most levels, is simply following the manual.<br><br>Also, most devices have common failure modes.  Once you have worked enough with one type of device, you learn the common failure modes, what causes them, and how to fix them.  This allows many repair engineers to fix common electronics without a repair manual.<br><br>Repair is also very different today than it has been in the past.  Modern devices are generally not designed to be repaired.  A good contrast can be made with old AM vacuum tube radios.  The vast number of tube-based AM radios were based on a circuit known as <dq>The All-American Five<dq> for the five vacuum tubes they contained.  Although there were slight differences in various models, all of them used the same basic design.  And furthermore, all of them contained a schematic glued to the inner back panel.

Ground as a voltage reference level for a circuit (the <dq>0 volt<dq> point of a circuit - voltage has no absolute, just a relative value like energy or time so pick a <dq>0<dq> and that defines the rest).<br><br>2. Ground as a current path to protect against electrocution.  In this case an alternative current path is created by adding an <dq>redundant<dq> ground to enclose the other circuits - currents will preferentially flow through this path rather than through a human touching part of the circuit.<br><br>3. Ground as a shield or conductive path for RF signals or noise.  The presumption is that <sq>DC<sq> ground like above also works for <sq>AC<sq> or <sq>RF<sq> but it only does up to a point.  This can cause paradoxical circuit currents that flow through the ground line in ways that are not ideally <dq>0 volts<dq> and thus affect main circuit performance.  This is where you have transmission lines rather than just <dq>wires<dq> in a DC sense.  AC currents do not flow the same as DC (and not just because they are alternating).<br><br>4. Ground as in earth ground in terms of atmospheric effects like radio or lightning.  In this case it<sq>s a combination of 1 & 2 for lightning where the voltage is that of the cloud relative to the ground (for DC).  For radio, the ionosphere and earth can form a waveguide/capacitor akin to 3 and is an AC effect.<br><br>So the ground plane of a PCB is a case of a transmission line where <dq>ground<dq> is not exactly the same as the DC ground.  It takes a finite amount of time for signal changes to flow down a transmission line so you can have AC voltages and currents that aren<sq>t at zero when you expect them to in a DC view of things because you have wave interactions instead.  <br><br>*When do you have to worry about these AC effects?  Roughly when the wavelength of the AC approaches the physical dimension resolution of your circuit.*  When the wavelength is much larger than physical dimensions, you can think of even AC as being like DC.  Near that dimension and shorter, you can not think of AC as like DC - a whole other mathematics and intuition is **required**.<br><br>This [transmission line video](http<colon>//techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2011/3/7/AT&T-Archives-Similarities-of-Wave-Behavior) illustrates this mechanically but is also valid for electrical transmission lines.<br><br>PCBs have to worry about this because digital clock edges reach the above criteria at about 100 MHz clock rates.</p>",

The reason an electret mic has the electret element is because the diaphragm doesn<sq>t have its own charge, right? Perhaps you<sq>re less interested in the electret and more interested in the JFET amplifier that<sq>s built into the capsule?<br><br>I<sq>d like to better understand the capsule type that you<sq>re using, and exactly how you<sq>re modifying it. Putting a shield behind a single sensitive electrode will add capacitance, and if the electrode is connected to a high impedance amp this will reduce signal voltage. But a typical electrode from an electret mic isn<sq>t alone, it<sq>s already in a grounded capsule. Putting a shield behind this won<sq>t reduce the signal much. <br><br>Some more detailed pics, diagrams, part numbers, whatever  might be nice. <br><br>If I were doing this, I<sq>d probably build a transimpedance amplifier out of an op amp and make my own electrode assembly. With a transimpedance amp, which is a low impedance amplifier, you could add a shield behind the pickup electrode with no reduction in sensitivity. You could also design the amplifier to roll off in gain at moderately high frequencies above say 2kHz, which would tend to suppress many noise sources. <br><br>Edit<colon> actually it might be better to configure the transimpedance amp as a charge amplifier, which has a capacitor in the feedback network which dominates in the signal range of interest. This could be made to roll off gain at high frequencies by putting a resistor in series with the sense electrode. <br><br>Edit 2<colon> I guess I didn<sq>t quite have a clear picture of how most electret mics are built. Didn<sq>t realize that the diaphragm _is_ the electret. Now it<sq>s clear that you<sq>re just using the built-in JFET amplifier. If this is so, then putting a metal shield behind the capsule really shouldn<sq>t reduce the signal that much. If your shield is closer to the bee than the microphone electrode, then it will add capacitance to the bee and reduce the voltage appearing on the bee. But if the shield is farther from the bee than the pickup electrode it shouldn<sq>t matter. <br><br>Also you should be able to put a capacitor across your audio input to roll off high frequencies if the noise you<sq>re getting is high frequency noise. </p>",

Logically, this is pretty similar to saying <dq>I<sq>m on this side of the wall, I need to get to the other side, but breaking through the wall takes energy, so to avoid this I<sq>ll just run at the wall _really fast_<dq>. <br><br>The problem is that the capacitor can<sq>t get from voltage A to B without passing through all the points in between. And the whole time it<sq>s charging up, current is flowing through the transistor. Let<sq>s say you want to charge a capacitor from 0V to 10V, from a 10V supply. You use a 1F capacitor and a 10A current. How efficient is this? Well, you start out 0<percent> efficient<colon> the switching device is delivering 1A current from 10V to 0V, so it<sq>s dissipating 10W, and the 0V load may be conducting 1A, but 0V times 1A is 0W. Half way through the process, the capacitor is at 5V and is absorbing 1A (5W), but the switching device is also conducting across a 5V difference. Also dissipating 5W. So the efficiency is now 50<percent>. Finally, as you approach full charge, the system transfers energy to the capacitor with an efficiency approaching 100<percent>. <br><br>Overall, though, the efficiency averaged over the whole 10 second charging process is exactly 50<percent>. <br><br>That<sq>s a particular scenario, the more general rule is that there<sq>s no way, using just a capacitor, to get power from one voltage to another without losing energy. There are tricks you can play, such as charging up two capacitors in series and then discharging them into a load in parallel<colon> this allows you to buck the voltage down to 1/2 with efficiency approaching 100<percent>. But this only works for integer ratios of voltages, and it gets really complicated for ratios like 2<colon>3. This technique is called charge pumping (the circuit is called a charge pump). <br><br>It works, and where efficiency isn<sq>t paramount it<sq>s a good solution.

Good job for doing experiments!<br><br>To answer your questions<colon><br><br>1. Ideal transformers only depend on the turns ratio, and not the actual number of turns. But real life transformers have something called magnetizing inductance, which is basically the inductance of your transformer, if the secondary side was open. (There is also something called leakage inductance, but we<sq>ll ignore that for now). Any inductance depends on the number of turns on your core, so if you have a larger amount of turns, you have lager inductance. Since inductance limits current, more turns will give less current tough the primary winding, when the secondary winding is open. This current will run regardless of what is connected to the secondary side. If there is nothing connected, only this magnetizing current will run. If there is something connected, the current into the transformer will be the sum of the current used by the secondary side(with respect to turns ratio) and the magnetizing current. You don<sq>t want your transformer to use any power when there is nothing on the secondary winding, so you want the magnetizing inductance to be as big as possible. A gazilion windings will make the magnetizing inductance very large and thus consume little current. Thats why you have a lot of turns. The number of turns is limited by the size of the transformer, the current cabability of the wire used and the amount of leakage inductance that is introduced, so you can<sq>t just keep adding turns. Leakage inductance is caused by the field from the primary side that doesn<sq>t couple to the secondary side. In practice this is the same as adding an inductor in series with the transformer. <br><br>2. Because you didn<sq>t have enough magnetizing inductance. You drew too much current. <br><br>3. Your turns ratio was 28<colon>6 or 4.67<colon>1. This would put a theoretical voltage of 5V on your secondary side. However, the large current drawn by your primary side magnetizing inductance probably meant that the voltage was significantly lower than 24V, which in turn gives an even lower secondary voltage.<br><br>Hope the explanations made sense.

Very little of the energy that you put into the core on one end is turning into electrical field in the coil on the other end (which is one of the factors contributing to the very low voltage you saw on the other end)<br><br>In any case, good on you for messing around with transformers!

Looks like there is a lot of soldering involved and some higher voltages.  Soldering is an art that takes a good bit of practice to get right.    There are good videos on youtube for soldering.  Stay away from lead-free solder.  It is hard to work with for beginners.  You can probably get a $20 soldering iron as the cheapest.  You still need other supplied - solder, flux, wire cutter, angle cutter, soldering stand/cleaner. Get a $10 solder practice kit, like this - http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Elenco-Practical-Soldering-Project-Kit/dp/B0002LUAL6/ref=pd_sim_328_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=11AZJT2AZAG0R3AXE4RC&dpID=519bj4ev-jL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR158<percent>2C160_ and try that.    The other thing is troubleshooting.  What happens when you build the thing and plug it in, and nothing happens?  Now you need a multi-meter and maybe other test equipment, so before you go spend $150 on a kit, try the practice one, and see how that goes. Or suck it up, and buy pre-built! Good luck!</p>",

Delays are horribly difficult to do in analogue, and I suspect 200ms would be particularly so if not impossible, depending on your signal bandwidth.<br><br>A time delay in analogue, _at a specific frequency_, is defined by the magnitude of its phase shift. So, a 1Hz signal that is shifted by \u2013\u03c0 radians is shifted by 500ms. At 2Hz, \u2013\u03c0 radians is 250ms.<br><br>This presents the obvious problem that a non-sinusoidal waveform must have all its components shifted by different values. In fact, a _linear_ phase shift as a function of frequency will result in a _constant_ delay of all components of a signal, and therefore the waveform will be preserved. We call the derivative of the phase shift _group delay_, as it represents the delay in time (not phase) of the components of a waveform; group delay = \u2013 d\u03c6/d\u03c9. If, over the bandwidth of a signal, you have a constant group delay, you preserve the waveform over that signal (all components are delayed equally).<br><br>Getting a perfectly linear phase shift/perfectly constant group delay over a very wide bandwidth is not going to happen, especially for very big group delays. I think making this precisely adjustable is completely impractical in analogue.<br><br>In general, the higher the bandwidth of your signal, the harder it will be to maintain big group delays. If you have a very narrow band, you can possibly build a circuit that has a maximally flat group delay in that band, or that sufficiently closely approximates it.<br><br>Hopefully that theory is enough to start you off if you want to do this in analogue (and good luck! Report back =P ).<br><br>You could look at a lot of common filter topologies (e.g. Butterworth, Bessel), which have group delays up to around the cutoff frequency. In particular, Bessel filters are known for having very good group delay response up to above their cutoff frequency.

If it<sq>s on 50<percent> of the time, the **average power** would be half of what it would be otherwise.<br><br>PWM controllers do this so fast that for all intents and purposes, it<sq>s exactly the same as variable power, but since you<sq>re not doing it with resistors, you don<sq>t have the very high losses due to heat.</p>",

I apologize in advance for my penmanship, and I hope I<sq>ve made no mistakes this late at night in my explanation.  <br>Time for some pictures!  <br>[Picture 1](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/Hf4qIdc.jpg)  <br>This is a series circuit.  <br>Regardless of what your resistors are, if one end is tied (with a wire) to the positive of the 10V source and the other is tied to common (the other side of the source) then your circuit HAS to drop all 10V.  <br>Ideally, your voltage **will not change** along the wire. It will change across a component. This is indicated by the blue dots. Any wires connected to a wire with a voltage will share that voltage.  <br>In a series circuit there is one path, so therefor **current does not branch** anywhere and remains a constant value through every component along the path.  <br>[Picture 2](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/EN80hCc.jpg)  <br>This circuit contains a parallel section.  <br>In the parallel section the current **will** branch, and since current tends to travel the path of the least resistance, more current will be found in the branch with a smaller R. As indicated by the orange guide, the current will branch and add up again at the end.  <br>Resistors in parallel will have both ends of each resistor connected together. If both ends are connected, that means they have to share the same voltage values, correct? Therefor across the resistors in parallel the same amount of voltage is dropped.  <br>The blue indicates the voltage distribution.  <br>[Picture 3](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/UTxWxky.jpg)  <br>This last part is just an aside. If it is given that the wire there is 4V, regardless of what that<sq>s connected to (not floating, lol) then you can make those assumptions in blue<colon> the top two resistors drop 6V and the bottom resistor drops 4V.

When the switch needs to signal your phone, by ringing it, it sends around 100vac down the line. Once you pick up the switch notes the open condition of the line and connects through to the calling party. In analog (and most non VOIP) systems voicel is modulated as an AC signal on top of the -48vdc carrier. Bell practices from the old days decided on a bandwidth of 300-3400Hz for voice grade circuits. So on analog systems that is the bandwidth of the modulated signal. <br>For digital signals they<sq>ve just called it 4kHz with guard bands. Using the Nyquist theorem means that the voice band is sampled at 8kHz. That is digitized into 8 bits per sample making a traditional voice call 64kbs.

Our audio signal is just a voltage that is proportional to the variations in pressure from the sound waves hitting the microphone. So its average value is zero. We can say that there is no DC component to the audio signal, only AC components. Likewise, we can transmit power as DC with no AC components. So all we have to do to send a signal and power down the same wire pair is to shift the average value of our audio signal to something nonzero, then shift it back at the other end. This is easy enough to do with simple passive components like resistors and capacitors.<br><br>The next trick is to get bidirectional communications over the same wire. The simplest way to do this is to just connect everything to the same wires. This might work, but there will be a lot of sidetone - meaning that you will hear yourself really loudly in your own earpiece. The way to get around this is to use what<sq>s called a hybrid<colon> a circuit that subtracts some of the signal being transmitted from the signal being received.

How would you do that? resistor + capacitor in series. <br><br>I<sq>ve never actually had such oscillation problems, so I assume circuits are generally not-so-sensitive to the precise resistor and capacitor values... So basically, I feel that if you have several output capacitors in parallel, and have just one that has higher ESR, you may be in a <dq>good enough<dq> situation... <br><br>This resistor + capacitor looks a lot like an AC termination to a transmission line; no DC consumption, just dissipates high frequencies... It is also how some high-frequency snubber circuits work, you see those in switching converters sometimes, where stray inductance and fast transistor switching can cause high-frequency ringing. <br><br>While googling just now for more <dq>formal<dq> information on the subject, I found this<colon> [look at figures 7, 8, 9]( http<colon>//www.designers-guide.org/Design/bypassing.pdf ), perhaps it explains it better than me. <br><br>This all can be simulated in PSpice or LTSpice BTW... This way you can easily create oscillation conditions and experiment with component values to damp the system. <br><br>Also, I guess a low-enough resistive load also helps; voltage oscillations are effectively power oscillations in the load, so this dissipates energy that has been coming in from the inductor... </p>",

I don<sq>t know if you are familiar with the subject, but most of a CPU is composed of a few very simple blocks called [logic gates](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate). Basically all you need are devices which can compute a few boolean operations<colon> AND, OR and NOT (technically you only really need NANDs or NORs, which are combinations of NOTs and ANDs/ORs).<br><br>These can be made from many different things, mechanical relays, vacuum tubes, transistors, etc., and have either one or two inputs and only one output. The Wikipedia article will explain what they do.<br>Now these gates can be configured to make a simply adder, which can add two binary numbers. Negate one number and you can make a subtractor. Be a bit more clever and you can make a multiplier, and be even clever-er and you can approximate any mathematical function, like sin(), log(), etc. (often these are done in software though). Now you can combine all those into an [ALU](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit) (or FPU) that will take in (say) two binary numbers, and allow you to perform whatever mathematical operation you want on them.<br><br>You can also configure gates accordingly to make flip-flops (which can store one bit), and flip-flops to make registers or RAM; so your simple computer can now store numbers, and perform mathematical operations on them. The next thing you need is a [control unit](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit) to be able to read instructions from memory and execute them on the CPU. This is also done with gates.<br><br><br><br>Note that none of this gate stuff necessarily involves transistors. Transistors just happen to be the current approach to implementing them (before it was relays and tubes). You can make a NOT gate, for example, from two different MOSFET transistors. One is turned on by 0 V (PMOS) and the other by, say, 5 V (NMOS). Since they<sq>re complementary, the combination is called [CMOS](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS#Inversion).<br><br>This simple CPU may not sound very powerful, but it<sq>s actually fairly typical. Computer software is really just a sequence of incredibly simple operations (add two numbers, store them in memory, flip this bit, etc.). More advanced microprocessors usually just add more instructions (e.g. maybe one to multiply entire matrices instead of just individual numbers) and tricks to make them faster (pipelining is a simple example).<br><br><br>You may want to read up on digital electronics if you<sq>re still interested (and I haven<sq>t confused you too much!).

                "answer": "<p>As roger_ says in his post, we have transistors some of which conduct when their input is at a low voltage, and some that conduct when their input is at a high voltage. We can arrange these transistors so as to perform logical operations - AND gates, OR gates, NOT gates and so on. [This page](http<colon>//www.iclayoutonline.com/Education/CMOSIntro/intropart4.asp) shows how transistors can be combined to produce NAND and NOR gates, and a NAND gate followed by a NOT gate is the same as an AND gate.<br><br>Once you<sq>ve got the basic logic gates, they can be combined to form things like a [full adder](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_adder) - and with 8 full adders in a line, you can add two 8-bit numbers.<br><br>If you look at the instruction set for a microprocessor - personally I<sq>m fond of the [PIC 16F628A](http<colon>//www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/devices.aspx?ddocname=en010210) - you<sq>ll notice it<sq>s got a pretty short instruction set - things like and, or, add, subtract, rotate left and so on - and it<sq>s got one register and a bit of memory.<br><br>So for each instruction, it<sq>s fairly easy to imagine the electronics you<sq>d need; for or you<sq>d use your or gates, to add you<sq>d use your full adder, to subtract you<sq>d use your full adder with [Two<sq>s complement](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two<percent>27s_complement), and so on.<br><br>Once you<sq>ve got the (decidedly manageable) set of instructions that a basic processor offers, more complicated operations like multiplying can be done with a series of those simple instructions - or with special hardware that amounts to a similar thing, but faster. For example to multiply X by 3 I shift the bits of X left by 1, which is equivalent to multiplying by two, then I add the shifted copy of X to the unshifted copy, which is equivalent to multiplying by three as  2*X + X = 3*X.<br><br>After that, it<sq>s all a matter of adding to the hardware so that more complicated operations can be done in less time.<br><br>Personally I like the book <dq>ARM system-on-chip architecture<dq> for more information but I haven<sq>t read that many different books on the subject, so other people might have recommendations based on broader foundations.</p>",

Without going too much into detail, a processor, is, fundamentally, what is called a state machine. That means that, given the state of a set of 1s and 0s called the current state, there are a number of possible <dq>next states<dq> that the processor can go to. When a processor is in a certain current state, it can change a number of outputs (also 1s and 0s) to make the processor implement a number of simple functions, like math, incrementing counters, twiddling bits- simple stuff. Learning about logic circuits and sequential state machines will help you enormously in understanding this. All a computer is is what<sq>s called a sequential state machine. It has state memory (what state it<sq>s in now), next state logic (what state it will go to next), and output logic (what being in its present state does to its surroundings).</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Part of being involved in firmware is that conceptually with software it truly doesn<sq>t matter what you program. Everything is turing complete. So python, or assembly, it completes and all that.<br><br>With hardware you need to be aware of things<colon><br><br>* What is asynchronous? Vector tables, UARTs, etc And how does your hardware physically handle that.<br><br>* What is the clock speed? What operates at that synchronous speed? Waht operates at a multiple of that speed. I.e. your analong to digital conversion happens much slower. for /r/arduino the documentation on the hardware (AVR ICs) says the ADC is 50-200 khz speed. But we can set the fuses on the main processor to 16mhz, or higher with an external quartz.<br><br>    Assume the AVR is clocked at 12MHz then do 12M/200k. The result is 60 so in a perfect world we<sq>d<br>    set the ADC prescaler to be 60 and hit 200k exactly. But its not a perfect world and your prescaler<br>    choices are limited to a shift to the right (i.e. dividing by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 etc) 64 is close to 60 and<br>    larger so it will give us an answer under 200k<colon><br>    12M/64=187.5kHz.<br>    Now the normal speed of the AVR chips is 8mhz<br>    if the main IC is 8mhz/200khz = 40, since the two choices are 32 and 64 and you have to go<br>    higher (on your divisior to go down on your speed to hit the acceptable range) we must choose 64.<br>    8m/64=125KHZ<br>    If we SLOW the main processor down though to 6.4 mhz so that we get 64M/200khz = 32<br>    we end up with a PERFECT prescale number and can eek every ouch of our ADC out.<br><br>* Why is the above important? If the bottle neck in your hardware is Analog to Digital Conversion you can actually SLOW the main processor down to speed the whole PROCESS up. For instance if the device you are writing firmware for is reading 300 analog temperature sensors and displaying the results or sending the results over some bus protocol we don<sq>t care about anything else except polling those sensors as quickly (while maintaining accuracy.)<br><br>* In the above example (300 sensors) we can also take advantage of PORTS that is on an 8 bit /r/arduino we have port size of 8 (because registers are 8 bits) so PORTA is often 0-7 pins, while B is 8-15 etc. We can decouple the ADC functions and actually run one ADC conversion on each port simultaneously. so instead of writing a loop to run 0-15 we write a loop that runs 0&7, 1&8, etc getting stuff done faster.<br><br>* I<sq>d suggest you get into a low level cheap hardware like AVR chips (of which you can start easy by getting into /r/arduino or the like)<br><br># Where do I begin?<br><br>* First. Firmware<sq>s job, its goal is not to present information, it is not to mess with the cutting edge AI, or algorithms.  **The job of firmware is to give hardware control to software as fast as safely possible while protecting hardware from software.<br><br>* The LIPO chargers that work in your cell phone or laptop are hack-able, they run firmware. If they are programmed poorly or incorrectly or deliberately you can burst Lithium ion batteries and cause fires. Your job as a firmware person is to never allow this to happen.<br><br>* At the same time as protection your job is to provide information to the software interface. Don<sq>t assume what people want to do with those 7 pieces of hardware you are sensing or moving. That is not your job. You don<sq>t write a program to read all 7 then give the average temp your job is to give them access to every sensor quickly with different options. I.e. how do I set a high level alarm so if a sensor goes above X I know immediately. As a firmware guy I write code that implements a hardware interrupt if a piece of software asks for one. The software guys doesn<sq>t care HOW that is done, only needs to know the fundamentals. i.e. what is in the data sheet. if you see a high alarm you are guaranteed to check that ever 18us and get an alarm in 2x that.<br><br>* You interface hardware. You need to know the amount of time it takes for that signal to oscillate into a stable voltage and then sample it. That<sq>s physics and testing and temperature dependent etc.<br><br>Sorry for the rambling mess of advice that is this post, but I<sq>m tired and not goign to fix it until tomorrow.

This plot shows, as a function of frequency, the approximate maximum power levels we can produce with electronics. Increasing in frequency from the left side is conventional analog electronics. As you may know, electrical signals of a given frequency can be described by their equivalent wavelength, according to (speed of light) = (frequency)*(wavelength). As you get to higher frequencies, it makes more sense to think of it as light of a certain wavelength.

Sometimes a batch is bad and doesn<sq>t meet specs, or has a high reject rate. It is discovered by the customer, all chips with that date code are rejected and returned to the manufacturer. The manufacturer would normally destroy them and send the customer a replacement batch. The customer puts a note in their parts database that the chips with that date code are unacceptable, because other vendors might have them in their inventory and you don<sq>t want to get them again.<br><br>Some customers may not notice that the batch does not meet spec, because they don<sq>t push that spec to the limit that reveals the flaw, so you find that there is no recall of the defective batches from the vendors, especially the secondary vendors (as opposed to prime vendors) who keep selling the known defective parts with the hope that nobody will notice. <br><br>A good manufacturer will recall a known bad batch from all prime vendors. They often can<sq>t recall them from secondary vendors because they don<sq>t know who those people are. The secondary vendors often know that some stock they have is under recall and known bad, but since they are not prime vendors, they can<sq>t get their money back, so they continue to sell the bad batches.<br><br>And that, boys and girls, is why you should only buy from prime vendors. =-} Sometimes you are forced by circumstance into buying from non-prime sources to keep production going. In that case you normally would ask for 20 samples, then test some of them in house, and send some out to a test house. There are specialty companies that do this for a living, testing non-prime parts for validation for OEMs who are in a pinch.<br><br>Non-prime parts can look like a bargain, but if you have been bit in the ass often enough by the high reject rate and the all the overhead of outside testing for validation, then you will find it is not the great bargain it seems to be. Keeping the assembly line rolling and the end customer happy is normally worth more than saving a few thousand on some non-prime parts.<br></p>",

Look at ACKme instead (same crew, same philosophy).<br>* Atmel<colon> Currently releasing their WILC1000 and WINC1500 modules. Unknown what their pricing is in ~100 units. I have personally spoken with their product team on these units and they are heavily targeting the low power MCU space with these products. Personal opinion is that they would be a good first party vendor to work with.<br>* Gainspan<colon> From what I can tell, they are fairly decent price/performance/reliability, but I<sq>ve never dealt with them other than getting a quote. Their tools are fairly pricy at $5k for the sdk to work with their chips directly.<br><br>**Reccomendations**<br><br>What is your use case?<br><br>* Serial to TCP only on LAN<colon> Probably the MxChip. Unless you actually need support. Then I<sq>d lean towards Ackme.<br>* Arduino on LAN<colon> Atmel may be more attractive due to historic partnership.<br>* Max Throughput<colon> Broadcom WICED module with custom firmware. Only way to go. BCM43362 chipset has throughput >30Mbps. TI CC3xxx is ~11Mbps. Serial-to-Wifi devices running SPI is 4-5 Mbps usually (My custom one is ~12 Mbps but runs with external stack and lots of custom things; not applicable in general).<br>* IOT and the Cloud<colon> Ackme offers some sort of device cloud service. Also, the previously identified Spark device. I have no experience in this area, so Your Milage May Vary.<br><br>[Edit]<colon> I forgot to mention one - Gainspan</p>",

When the compressor starts, there is a high current draw to the fridge, which in conjunction with possibly bad wiring (higher resistance) causes a voltage dip at the monitor that its internal power supply caps can<sq>t keep up with.  This is the fault of the building wiring but if your monitor<sq>s power supply caps are going, this will exacerbate the problem.<br><br>2.  The fridge motor is likely a split phase motor with a starting cap.  If the cap is bad, the motor is going to take longer to start, increasing the time of the voltage dip on the line.<br><br>3.  As your monitor only goes on the blink when the motor turns *on*, not when it turns *off*, this leads me to suspect it is not noise, but a dip.  (The explanation is complicated, but it involves the back emf of the motor windings vs. the opening time of the motor relay causing arcing.  Electrical noise is caused by contacts *opening*, not *closing*.)<br><br>Therefore<colon><br><br>Because it likely isn<sq>t electrical noise, conventional solutions like a ferrite on the line aren<sq>t going to help.<br><br>A surge protector isn<sq>t going to help either, as what you<sq>re seeing is a dip, not a surge.<br><br>I would suggest moving either the fridge or the monitor to a different circuit in the house.

(http<colon>//www.radioshack.com/electronics-learning-lab-kit/2800055.html#start=35&q=learn&sz=12) also they have the engineer books, which I have and am learning ( http<colon>//www.radioshack.com/engineers-mini-notebook-volume-1/6200101.html#q=book&start=8) and the makers book (http<colon>//www.radioshack.com/getting-started-in-electronics-book/6200100.html#q=book&start=1)<br><br>this should get you in the right direction. A ton of it can be gotten at Radioshack ( I used to work there, so I still try to support them) but you can get all that stuff online too. </p>",

From what I can understand, there is 0.5mg/m3 of Barium, the element, but less than 5<percent> Barium in terms of insulation composition, minimum of 1<percent>.<br><br>So lets start with what the msds lists.  From the Barium based dyes<colon> *Can cause irritation of mucous membranes, skin and upper resperatory tract.  Acute overexposures<colon> Can cause benign lung disease (baritosis).  Effects are reversible on cessation of exposure.<br><br>Ok, so that doesn<sq>t sounds terrible, but also not good.  Lets see what [wikipedia](http<colon>//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium) says about Barium based compounds. <br>>Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. At low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, whereas higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, dyspnea and paralysis. This may be due to the ability of Ba2+ to block potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other target organs for water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin. They affect the body strongly, causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.<br><br>Ok, so that<sq>s not great.  But hopefully the Barium based compounds in this particular insulation wont convert to anything more toxic in the body and have a short half life.<br><br>So there is other stuff listen in the msds, carbon black as a carcinogen, can cause chronic bronchitis and lung disease.<br><br>Ok.... So this was the first msds I found.  Maybe this is particular bad for you wire.  Maybe it<sq>s not.  Definitely it lists the materials as safe **Under anticipated conditions of use** aka legal speak for wire is not food.  <br>And as many other have mentioned there are the plasticizers that are potential endocrine disruptors, meaning they mess with your hormones and that<sq>s not good.<br><br>Now, there<sq>s not going to be a lot of stuff that ends up in your body from you chewing on the wire, but it<sq>s going to end up there and wont be good for you.

It would take forever to analyse the circuit every time you want to check the output voltage with a different load resistance or load circuit. <br><br>Instead, you can calculate the open circuit voltage (output voltage assuming nothing is connected), and then an equivalent series impedance (resistance, inductance and/or capacitance). From there you have a voltage source and a series impedance that acts the same as your complicated circuit, as far as the output voltage is concerned. <br><br>The resulting circuit is called the Th\u00e9venin equivalent circuit. A relayed equivalent circuit is the Norton one. <br><br>You can use this technique to simplify complicated circuits involving, for example, amplifiers by reducing parts of the circuit into Th\u00e9venin equivalents and then putting those back into the final circuit.

As far as nail polish I just borrowed some that my wife had on hand, no idea what it was other than it was probably pretty cheap stuff, I just made sure to use a solid color without any metallic flakes. The brush that comes in the nail polish works just fine, as you bring the brush up you can run it along the neck of the bottle and kind of shape the brush to achieve the shape of the trace or pad you need.<br><br>The biggest pitfall for me was thinking about the layout for through-hole components, because you<sq>d typically mount them on the side of the board without the traces, so the trace layout has to be a mirror image of your physical layout, when using surface mount you don<sq>t have to do that, so when mixing components you really have to think out what needs to be mirrored and what doesn<sq>t. Also enchant solution works MUCH better when warm, I used to etch in my garage and in the winter time etching without a way to warm the enchant was like watching grass grow, it just doesn<sq>t work, so do it in a place where the solution is at least somewhat warm.

But the idea of ground is a bit misleading. Ground is typically just a 0 reference point in a circuit, and everything that is tied to ground is actually connected, giving you your closed loop. So you can actually just redraw your circuit with everything connected and forgo the ground icons; you can even move it to different locations for analyzation purposes if you like. Typically you<sq>ll find ground symbols placed before (or after) voltage or current sources so that you<sq>re only working with positive or negative numbers. And its often used to make diagramming a bit easier so you don<sq>t have lines all over the place.<br><br>[This is an oversimplification; there are different types of ground<colon> signal ground (as noted above in the schematic);  along with chassis ground, and earth ground (which in most cases should be the same but might not be in certain circumstances). The later will behave more like you<sq>d assume ground to be. Briefly, a signal ground like the diagram will pass ground current through its inputs and outputs, meaning your guitar is actually part of the circuit. If the circuit isn<sq>t connected to a proper chassis/earth ground somewhere, your body could possibly create that earth ground and if there<sq>s AC involved, it could kill you so be safe. But I<sq>m getting off course.]<br><br>So guitars work by creating inductive voltage in a magnetic field. The metal string wobbles in a field created by the coils and the variable motion creates a change in current, which gives us a waveform. Wires around the magnets help create this field as well as carry the signal to our electronics. The signal though is weak (millivolts) so we have to amplify it for it to be usable.<br><br>Most amplifiers basically piggyback the signal we want amplified on some sort of applied voltage (in this case the battery). Tubes use collector plates to beef up this base voltage, but op-amps are clever because they use a feedback system to beef up the signal. Ideally the feedback is infinite, so we need to reduce and control the amount of return signal for the amp to operate how we want it to, so we put some resistance in the feedback, limiting the amount of signal that<sq>s allowed to return.<br><br>So, very simply, our signal is added to a base voltage and carefully fed back upon itself to amplify it.</p>",

Then start looking at the other passive components, capacitors and inductors. You should use an oscilloscope to see the waveforms. Once you understand how all the passive components react to DC, you should venture into the world of AC. Learn about capacitive and inductive reactance and how they respond to frequency. After you figure all that out head back to DC land to start learning about semiconductors. Start with diodes. Build a full wave brige rectifier. Light up some leds. Grab an NPN bipolar junction transistor and learn about its three regions<colon> saturation, linear, and cutoff. Use the saturation and cutoff regions to switch an led on and off using a smaller signal. Learn about h-bridges and how they can be used to as a solution to bidirectional control for a dc motor. Then start investigating the linear region and learn about how this region can be used to amplify and audio  signal. Also investigate both npn and pnp transistors together and push pull amplification. After you have the basic bjt figured out look at other different transistors such as the mosfet. Once you got all that figured out start looking into op-amps. Learn about inverting, non-inverting, gains, hi-pass and low-pass filters, integraters, differentiaters, unity-gain, comparators, positive feedback, historesis, etc..

                "answer": "<p>I like to repair old test equipment.  For example, my portable <sq>scope is from the <sq>70s and still working great.  <br><br>What tends to fail on old equipment, assuming nothing else does, is the switch contacts.  Despite being gold-plated, they accumulate gunk over time and stop working.  It<sq>s good to avoid as many physical switches as you can.  Despite not requiring any replacement parts, my <sq>scope did require extensive contact cleaning after it sat idle for several years.  An alternative is to seal the device with a desiccant inside.  Another piece of test equipment I have is mil-spec and has this.  It did not require any contact cleaning when I acquired it, even though most other equipment from its era does.  <br><br>The fan motor in that <sq>scope is a brushless DC motor.  It doesn<sq>t seem like anything special now (since most muffin fans are BLDC), but it was significant at the time because of the low amount of electrical noise it generated, and its reliability.  As a rule of thumb, try to avoid brushes in motors for this sort of thing.  AC motors should be induction or permanent-magnet synchronous, and DC motors should be brushless.  Depending on the duty cycle, the bearings may or may not last that long.  <br><br>Conformal-coating the boards is unnecessary unless they<sq>re going to see metal chips or weather.  It will make your device harder to repair if something does go wrong with it.  <br><br>Lead solder is a very good idea.  You<sq>ll notice that some test equipment and the military still use it today, since it<sq>s more reliable.  <br><br>Wide traces are good, as is thick copper.  Obviously, you want solder mask and tinning of the board too.  Silkscreen your component reference IDs on too (C1, R2, etc\u2026)<br><br>As others have said, avoid flash memory for firmware storage.  If you use it for data storage, make sure that your device will be able to recover from having its flash corrupted or erased.  <br><br>Build your enclosures like you actually want them to withstand the test of time.  Laptops today are a great example of devices that won<sq>t. Old test equipment is built of chunky aluminum castings and extrusions, screwed together.  Older test equipment is built of sheet steel, screwed together and braced.  It will be heavy and expensive, but that shouldn<sq>t sway you.  <br><br>Panel-mount connectors, switches and potentiometers are better than board-mount.  Board-mount means the board takes the stress; panel mount means your sturdy enclosure takes the stress.  There are solder joints at stake here, and not just the ones holding the switches on.  Sometimes, flexing of the board can cause solder joints to fail in new and interesting places you never expected.  <br><br>The one thing rarely considered today is repairability.  <br><br>This is the main reason why test equipment from the <sq>80s and earlier is still hanging around today.  <br><br>Make sure your enclosure can be opened and that someone can get to the insides without ripping their hair out or breaking something.  <br><br>Try to use standard parts wherever you can (7400 series, 4000 series).  A dead microcontroller usually means a junk device.  <br><br>If you must use a microcontroller, use a common one and make sure the hex file for programming is archived somewhere.  This is especially difficult to do if you<sq>re an individual or a small company, since you won<sq>t have a website around (or whatever we have in 60 years) to host the file.  Better yet, include a paper manual with the device, and print the code in there.  Common types of data storage today are actually less reliable than paper over the timescale you<sq>re looking at.  Flash drives won<sq>t last.  Consumer-burned optical media won<sq>t last.  A hard drive won<sq>t last.  Paper will, and it can be OCR<sq>d back into a computer.  With a high-res laser printer, you can make the text very small, yet still scannable, assuming you use an OCR font.  This will help reduce the insane amount of pages this sort of thing takes.  <br><br>Include your schematics.  This is also rarely done today, but it is what will make the difference if someone needs to repair one of your devices in the future.  These can also go in your paper manual.  The schematics should have a component list tied to them.  <br><br>The other thing to include in your manual is a theory of operation.  This will help anyone attempting to repair your device by giving them an idea of what<sq>s supposed to be doing what.  If you rely heavily on digital logic, leave some points for them to hook up a logic analyzer, and tell them what<sq>s supposed to produce what.  Self-tests are underrated.  If you<sq>re doing mostly analog, show what voltages and signals should look like at certain points along the signal path, especially if it<sq>s not obvious.  <br><br>Finally, make sure you include some protection circuitry for your more fragile/important components.  Crowbars on your power rails are underrated when an overvoltage will kill half the parts on your board.  </p>",

Speed sort of also covers the ability to parallelize tasks, that is doing several things at once. Since the FPGA is a bunch of logic gates(called macro cells) you can glue together, you can make several editions of one circuit, thus making a number of things run in parallel, without having to wait for the previous data to run through the single circuit first. Thus, if you need to handle a lot of data that isn<sq>t dependent on each other. For instance, you might want to do a1*b1 + a2*b2 ....+an*bn, then you can basically do n multiplication circuits that will then do all the calculations in a single step, and one summing circuit that sums up everything. This of course is only feasible if the data is present at once, such as if it comes from different inputs. If the data needs to be read from RAM or something, chances are that you<sq>d be no better off, since you have to wait for the loading anyway. <br><br>Another example of why they are faster, is with development time. An FPGA is sort of like an intermediate ASIC(Application specific integrated circuit). With an ASIC you can get better speeds, but developing an IC and setting it up manufacturing is very expensive. Its only once everything is up and running that it becomes cheap. Thus, for small production runs it is cheaper to use some extra money on getting an FPGA that you can easily program as opposed to using extra money/time on manufacturing an ASIC.<br><br>> I<sq>d love to do some realtime image processing that mainly just deals with repeated matrix transforms and possibly fft pattern detection. Is this something that can be computed faster/ more effectively using FPGAs?<br><br>Depends. You can probably do matrix multiplication very quickly, since the data is already there(And since it doesn<sq>t depend on other calculations, like explained above). But something like passing a kernel across a matrix is probably more tricky, since the values used in step n are dependent on the values used in step n-1. Thus, you don<sq>t get much improvement compared to a microcontroller. But the beauty is that you can then just implement a microcontroller(called asoft core) on your FPGA, to do that stuff(and other stuff, since there would be no sense in implementing a microcontroller to do only one task).<br><br>> How does one go about learning to design systems using these things?<br><br>Get a development board. Thats the best approach. Start with the mandatory blinking LED project and work your way up. Just about everyone i know have started out with some form of Spartan 3 starter kit.

The first coordinate (we<sq>ll call A) are circles with the right edge passing through the right center point. A varies from 0 (the entire circle) to infinity (the point on the right). A = 1 is the circle with left edge at the center and right edge at the right.<br><br>The second coordinate is the arcs of doom (we<sq>ll call B). There are positive arcs (starting from the right center they curve up to the top) and negative arcs (curving towards the bottom). B varies from 0 (the line from the left center to right center, cutting the circle in half) to infinity (the right point). The curve B = 1 is the curve that ends up pointing straight up, B = -1 is the one pointing straight down.<br><br>A Smith Chart has a ton of uses, but we<sq>ll just go with the simplest and if you get that we can talk about it in more detail. In this case we are going to move a coordinate by a distance L. Here are the steps<colon><br><br>1) First you need to know what your reference value is. This is usually called `[;Z_0;]` (characteristic impedance). In this case let<sq>s make it `[; Z_0=50 ;]`. <br><br>2) Next, you need to get a coordinate, we<sq>ll call it `[; Z_L ;]` (load impedance). Let<sq>s make it `[; Z_L = (50, 50) ;]`.<br><br>3) We need to move `[; Z_L ;]` into our Smith Chart coordinate system by normalizing the values. This is really easy, just divide each coordinate of `[; Z_L ;]` by `[; Z_0 ;]`. We<sq>ll call that `[; z_L ;]` (normalized load impedance). In this case it is `[; z_L = (1, 1) ;]`. Draw that point on your Smith Chart ([print one](http<colon>//sss-mag.com/pdf/smithchart.pdf) out btw).<br><br>4) Next grab yourself a [compass](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_(drafting\\)#Construction) and put the spike end at the center of the Smith Chart and draw a circle passing through your point `[; z_L ;]`.<br><br>5) Now you need to know how far you want to go. We called it L above and most of the time it is a fraction multiplied by this symbol `[; \\lambda ;]` lambda. When you rotate you go *clockwise* or *towards the generator*. Each half-rotation is `[; \\frac{1}{4} \\lambda ;]` and each full rotation (you end where you started!) is `[; \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda ;]`. If I say rotate towards the generator by `[; \\frac{1}{8} \\lambda ;]`, you should start at (1,1) and rotate clockwise by a quarter of a circle. There are convenient markings at the edge of the Smith Chart to help you do the rotations. With a ruler you can draw a line from the center, through your point, to the edge. There are degrees along with fractions of lambda going in both directions (CW and CCW clockwise and counter clockwise). Draw your line, add 0.125 (`[; \\frac{1}{8} \\lambda ;]`), then draw a line from that mark to the center and your final point is where the line intersects your circle. You just keep spinning around the circle if your distance is greater than `[; \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda ;]`.<br><br>6) Mark this point! We<sq>ll call it `[; z_{in} ;]` (input impedance).<br><br>7) Remove the normalization by multiplying by `[; Z_0 ;]`. Call that `[; Z_{in} ;]`.<br><br>8) You are done! You have now moved your point `[; Z_L ;]` to `[; Z_{in} ;]` and you can confidently tell your boyfriend you know the <br>**input impedance for any load impedance on a transmission line with characteristic `[; Z_0 ;]`**.<br><br>**edit** Forgot to add that when he gives you `[; Z_L ;]` it will typically look like `[; A+iB ;]` or `[;A+jB;]`. The i and j just tell you *this is the second coordinate*, so instead write it as (A,B). They are called complex numbers and they have properties that make them very convenient for engineering.<br></p>",

Honestly, it won<sq>t make a lot of sense if you don<sq>t already have some experience with, at the very least, complex numbers.<br><br>Here<sq>s the best I can do in non-engineering terms. Again, if you have no concept of complex numbers this will probably make zero sense. The Smith Chart provides a way to plot complex electrical impedances (or, put more simply, complex numbers) and determine ways of <sq>moving<sq> between them. So say you have a complex number A + Bi, where A can range from 0 to +infinity, B can range from -infinity to +infinity, and i is the imaginary number. To plot this number on the Smith Chart, find the point on the horizontal axis that corresponds to A. So if A=1, find the 1.0 point right in the middle of the chart. To plot the imaginary part (B), you move along the ring that goes through the 1.0 point. If B is positive you move up, if B is negative you move down. So if B = -2.0, move down the ring until you hit the intersection with the 2.0 line (you can see the 2.0 at the outer edge of the chart).<br><br>[Here<sq>s](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/zA2cb.jpg) a poorly-made picture demonstrating the process of plotting (1 - 2i). Note this is just how you plot points on the chart.

                "answer": "<p>Very good question.  There doesn<sq>t seem to be anything in your design that would cause this.  I would first verify that your transistors are functional.  If you hooked them up improperly in a previous attempt, one may be blown and acting as a near-short.  <br><br>Find where the large currents are by probing with the volts setting on a multimeter.  Disconnect the source from the amp, and turn R1 all the way to ground.  <br><br>Check the voltages across R7 and R8.  If they are large, check the collector-emitter voltages of T3 and T4.  If one of them is very small, the transistor is probably shorted.  If you find this, remove both T3 and T4 from the circuit, but don<sq>t toss them yet.  You also need to maintain all other connections in the circuit for this test to work.  Then, check the voltages across T1 and T2, and check the output voltage with respect to ground.  If one of them has a much smaller voltage across it (collector to emitter) than the other, check its base-emitter voltage.  If it is greater than about 0.7 V in magnitude, that transistor is almost certainly fried.  If neither T1 nor T2 show any anomalies, replace T3 and/or T4, based on whether either of them showed any odd behavior.  <br><br>A few other things about your amp<colon><br><br> - I<sq>m assuming you intend it for audio, given your topology and component choices.  If this is not true, I<sq>m curious about what you intend to use it for.  <br><br> - You currently have identical AC and DC gains.  This is bad for audio (speakers don<sq>t like DC), especially considering the terrible input offset voltage spec of a 741.  In addition to upgrading your op-amp (look into the TL072 or LF411; the 741 is barely suitable for audio), you should add a large capacitance between the lowest leg of R2 and ground, which will reduce your DC gain to 1.  <br><br> - You don<sq>t need C2 if you have split rails.  Your speaker should be connected from where C2 is now to ground.  With no input, there will be 0 V across the speaker (assuming you upgrade your op-amp).  Output capacitors usually introduce a fair amount of distortion unless they are enormous, and enormous electrolytics get expensive.  If you don<sq>t need an output capacitor, it<sq>s best to avoid having one.  <br><br> - R1 and R2 are redundant.  It would be best to replace at least one with a fixed divider.  I recommend replacing R2 with a divider, since then you<sq>ll have a predictable gain.  Usually, audio amplifiers have something in the range of a gain of 20 for AC (above 10-15 Hz) and a gain of 1 for DC.  <br><br></p>",

All precision instruments like Agilent sells get most of their accuracy (even for non-time measurement parameters) from crystal oscillators.<br><br>The main thing is there are all sorts on <dq>non-idealities<dq> in crystals despite their awesomeness and ubiquity.  <br><br>One is the <dq>equivalent circuit<dq>  (page 8 - and this is ignoring similar implied parallel equivalent circuits for each higher order harmonic!).  It gives you the frequency response below the circuit diagram.  <br><br>One of the reasons for the other components is to prevent crossing over anti-resonance peak (left-to-right) to the zero point which is also <dq>stable<dq> as an oscillating frequency for series resonant but not very stable in oscillating frequency.<br><br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>> I understand the crystal side of it - apply voltage across crystal, it resonates quite accurately at a known frequency.<br><br>Naw dawg, that ain<sq>t how it works at all. Applying a stable, constant voltage to a crystal will result in a big fat bucket of nothing. No oscillations at all.<br><br>A crystal acts more or less like an inductor. It has some series resistance, and a small amount of parallel capacitance too. But as a crude first approximation, the crystal<sq>s behavior at the nominal operating frequency is approximately like a coil.<br><br>So what you have is basically a coil sandwiched between two capacitors. Aka an [LC circuit.](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit) The physical analogy would be mass in zero G being held in place by two springs. Give the mass an initial kick, and it bounces back and forth between the springs for quite a while.<br><br>Of course in reality there<sq>s more to it than that. The series resistance of the crystal slowly diminishes the current flowing back and forth. Just like air resistance slowly slows down on a mass oscillating back and forth between two springs. So you end up having to add some energy to the oscillation, or it<sq>ll slowly die out. (<dq>Slowly<dq> in an electrical sense - meaning within a few milliseconds.)<br><br>And that<sq>s where things get tricky. When you have an active device driving a resonant circuit, all sorts of fun complications come into play. You get into oscillator theory, [Barkhausen<sq>s Criteria](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkhausen_stability_criterion), all sorts of heavy duty third-year EE stuff.<br><br>> What I<sq>m wondering is, how do they actually work?<br><br>Most of these microcontroller crystal circuits are [Pierce oscillators](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_oscillator). Which means they use an inverter as the active component that keeps the oscillator from slowly dying out. The inverter is inside the microcontroller chip, and has pins connected to it so you can hook up the crystal and caps.<br><br>> but how do the caps come into play?<br><br>They form (most of) the <dq>C<dq> part of the resonant LC circuit. The crystal is the L. It<sq>s the *combination* of the L and C together that determine the oscillating frequency of the circuit. That<sq>s why you have to get the caps right - otherwise the circuit won<sq>t oscillate at the correct frequency. (Or sometimes, won<sq>t oscillate at all.)<br><br>> <sq>m trying to figure out what cap values to use. The datasheet for the crystal I<sq>ll use (ABRACON ABLS series) says <dq>Load Capacitance<colon> 18pF<dq><br><br>The simplest formula is<colon> Ccaps = Cload * 2. In this case<colon> 18 pF * 2 = 36 pF. Each of your caps should be 36pF.<br><br>Why times 2? Because your two caps are in series with each other (via the crystal). [Caps in series diminish the total capacitance](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Capacitors) by the formula<colon> 1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ... . In the case of only two caps, which both have the same value, the formula simplifies to<colon> Ctotal = 1/2*C.<br><br>You want Ctotal = 18pF. Therefore C should be 36 pF, or as close as you can get. (36 pF is a standard cap value, so in this case you can match it exactly.)<br><br>This formula assumes no stray capacitance from the PC board, microcontroller chip, or from the crystal itself. Of course in reality that ain<sq>t true. If you want a more complicated formulas that takes into account those factors, consult the data sheets below, or the wikipedia page on Pierce Oscillators above. <br><br>> where can I learn how the crystal circuits work and what cap values I should use?<br><br>Some app notes that may be helpful<colon><br><br>http<colon>//www.crystekcrystals.com/crystal/appnotes/PierceGateLoadCap.pdf<br><br>http<colon>//www.eetkorea.com/ARTICLES/2001SEP/2001SEP06_AMD_AN.PDF</p>",

So you may have 10 cells in yours so it<sq>s nominally 4.5V. Then there is a current rating. The total power is equal to volts times current rating. You can guess the power rating because solar panels are tested with an easy 1000 watts per square metre. So if your solar panel is 0.1 square metres, 100W of energy hits it under normal sunlight. You then also factor in efficiency which is about 5-10<percent>. So a 10W solar panel is as small as 0.1 square metres.<br><br>So lets say you measure your panel and it<sq>s 0.5x0.2 metres = 0.1 square metres. Times 10<percent> times 1000 = 10 watts.

This means that your reference has to be stable to better than that over the time between those two points.<br><br>Over very short periods of time, this stability gets subsumed into the noise measurements (specifically periods of time on the same order as the lowest frequency noise component accounted for.) However, if you are looking at comparing voltages that are seconds (or days) apart, the values can change appreciably, just from reference stability, let alone thermal stability.<br><br>Speaking of thermal stability, this ADC will do fine for offset stability over temperature, but because you also have a DC bias on your signal, gain stability is a real threat. The scale for the gain stability is 0.1<percent> per division. At 20-40C, the gain stability varies for most of them by as much as a fourth of a division. This equates to 0.025<percent> or 250 PPM. In absolute terms, this means that over that temperature range, a constant 3.300000V signal will appear to vary by as much as 0.025<percent>*3.3V, or 825 uV, just because of the change in DC gain of the amplifier as a function of temperature. Again, as long as the time between samples is short (ms or shorter) this probably won<sq>t make your measurement impossible (except under rapid heating like in an explosion for furnace) but for minutes or hours of timespan, this will make your measurements unusable.<br><br>More along those same thermal lines, you<sq>ll have to concern yourself with seeback effect voltages. Any kind of thermal gradient or difference in metals in the connections will induce voltages at bimetallic junctions (such as those between solder and copper.) These voltages will be significant relative to your 120uV.<br><br>In practice, the only way I can think of to deal with your measurement is to get rid of your DC offset; 36 PPM is a VERY tight number, even for precision instrumentation as big as a desktop, let alone a single component. Even then, you<sq>ll need to do some precision work to deal with thermal effects and board noise to make your 0-120uV measurement (remember, this is assuming you got rid of the offset.) That latter case is doable with components and very careful design, but your error margins will be tight, and you<sq>ll need to simulate your board very well (or run a prototype through rigorous thermal, vibration, and EMI environmental testing) to have any real confidence that the design will be reliable across the expected environmental conditions it<sq>s expected to work in.</p>",

To summarize, with a great voltage reference, pick low linearity error ADCs, size your voltage to them with other circuit stages and calibrate everything.

Most opamps will pump out ten to fifty milliamps; the LM13700 has a surprising datasheet spec (page 5) called <dq>Peak Output Current<dq>.  Look it up, it<sq>s surprising.

To put numbers on it, assume you<sq>re running at max transconductance (13 milli Siemens) and assume you<sq>re driving a 100K ohm load, which is by far the highest load resistance shown in any of the figures in the datasheet (Fig 25).  Then open loop gain is 0.013 \\* 1E5 = 1300X = 62dB.  Opamps generally provide 90-110dB of open loop gain!   Since you don<sq>t have a lot of gain you won<sq>t have a lot of negative feedback, and so you won<sq>t get a lot of distortion reduction.  Which is why the datasheet talks about 0.5<percent> total harmonic distortion, a gigantic enormous number compared to modern opamps like LM4562.  Maybe you<sq>re using the LM13700 as an <dq>effects box<dq> and maybe distortion is a good thing.  Cause you<sq>re going to get *plenty* of distortion.</p>",

You need to have a talk with your layout team about running DRC. The design rules are there for a reason!

Hopefully the manufacturer masked them away, since if they didn<sq>t, they<sq>ll be dangling all over the place and get trapped where you don<sq>t want them.<br><br>There are soldermask slivers between the cluster of four vias shown on the second set of images you linked. <br><br>If you had courtyards displayed, you<sq>d see that many of the components are in complete violation of each other<sq>s courtyards, which means that they may not have sufficient room for the pick-and-place machine vacuum chuck, and so aren<sq>t guaranteed to be manufacturable. They could be manufacturable, but it will be vendor-dependent, so the best case is that your design isn<sq>t portable and you<sq>re locked out of using particular (probably cheaper) PCB assembly vendors.<br><br>Many decoupling caps (for instance, the upper right two caps in the first image) have heavily unbalanced copper and no thermals, which could lead to tombstoning as the solder paste melts unevenly. <br><br>You<sq>ve got critical silkscreen (well, I<sq>d call it critical anyway) from the large IC pin 1 marker completely covering a pair of capacitor pads.

We typically assume a registration error of 0.004<dq>. The VCC trace from the micro USB connector is a great example of this.

I<sq>d guesttimate that the motor is taking around half an amp when running, that the supply rail is probably around 15v and the original resistor was  6.8 ohm. It would have needed to be around a 3W resistor for long life - but I suspect that they made do with a 1W one. <br><br>The above is just a guess based on similar machines with 12v motors that I have seen - but may provide a starting point on what to check<colon> The rail voltage. The run current of the motor.  Hence the voltage dropping resistor needed.. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>ll try to keep this coherent, but you<sq>ve got a lot of different questions here, even if you don<sq>t quite realize it.<br><br>First off<colon> The top load<colon><br><br>The top sphere or toroid of a tesla coil does two things<colon> It suppresses corona, and it acts as a capacitor.<br><br>Corona occurs most readily at sharp points and edges. This is because the electrons are (almost literally) piling up at this narrow choke point, and the pressure from behind flings the ones near the edge off in to the abyss. These free electrons grab hold of the first available atom, usually part of a molecule of atmopheric gas (oxygen is a favorite), and these ionized molecules begin to glow.<br><br>This ionized gas cloud causes a reduction in maximum <sq>strike<sq> length (the size of the gap across which a streamer will actually initiate) in two primary ways.<br><br>Firstly, the loss of charge in to the air around the wire results in a reduction in the open circuit voltage across the coil. Less electrons to push on in the wire means less voltage.<br><br>Secondly, the ionized cloud has a lower resistance than a dry, neutrally charged atmosphere would, which allows electrons to be stripped off the wire even more efficiently. This means that a big plasma cloud forms and robs you of voltage before maximum possible voltage is reached and a streamer could form, and it also allows the streamer to form solely within the plasma cloud, dispersing it<sq>s charge in to the atmosphere rather than to a grounded object. As soon as the streamer forms, the voltage of the wire relative to ground (or surrounding objects) plummets. It becomes a loaded voltage, not an open circuit voltage.<br><br>The top sphere provides a smooth, uniform surface with no edges where charge can pile up and jump off. This allows the voltage to build to an absolute maximum open circuit voltage.<br><br>The sphere also behaves as a capacitor. The coil itself can only store so much charge over the course of one half of a sinusoidal waveform. The actual amount is determined by the power handling capacity of the drive circuit, the efficiency of the primary to secondary coupling, the impedance of the coil, and a few other factors.<br><br>A top capacitor can lower the resonant frequency of the coil, letting you drive it at a lower frequency, giving you more time to transfer charge from the primary side to the secondary side. It also provides you with a bigger <dq>bucket<dq> to store the charge in, giving the streamers more power to work with once they form.<br><br>The benefit of the lower resonant frequency can only be realized if the circuit can be tuned in some fashion to ensure the drive circuit is driving the coil at it<sq>s resonant frequency. If the coil is not tuned perfectly to the drive circuit output, you<sq>re losing some amount of performance due to inefficiency in power transfer. Without a schematic I can<sq>t say for sure whether your circuit can be tuned, but it seems somewhat unlikely.<br><br>That said, it isn<sq>t likely to actually hurt the coil unless the toroid is positioned in such a way that a streamer could strike the circuit itself, or unless the max coil voltage increases so much that you get primary to secondary flash-over or huge inductive kickback on the primary (possible, but probably unlikely with a small top load on that little circuit), so you could grab an old brass doorknob or some other smooth metal object and give it a try. It would just connect directly to the wire coming from the top of the coil. You do this at your own risk though, I can<sq>t promise that little driver circuit won<sq>t be unhappy about it.<br><br>---<br><br>Second<colon> Plasma generator vs. tesla coil streamer behavior.<br><br>Let<sq>s compare the output of the two devices<colon><br><br>The plasma generator *appears* to be a simple push-pull flyback transformer circuit. These typically produce a max voltage in the 5-20kV range at a high frequency, typically >10kHz but below 100kHz. These devices are very frequently paired with a capacitive multipler, also called a  Cascade Multiplier, a series of capacitors and diodes that multiply the output voltage at the expense of output frequency. Basically they<sq>ll take several cycles from the transformer to charge the capacitors in the cascade and then output a DC pulse. This means they can also provide a very brief but fairly high peak current during the pulses, often a few tens of milliamps in to a dead short (WARNING<colon> A dead short to ground may destroy the cascade).<br><br>The tesla coil is a purely AC device. They typically operate between 100kHz and 500kHz, with the resonant frequency of the secondary coil being a function of physical size and the inductance and capacitance of the coil winding and top hat. A coil as small as yours is very likely resonant at *very* high frequencies, perhaps above 500kHz, and I wouldn<sq>t be surprised to find that it is being driven at a sub harmonic (250kHz drive frequency if the resonant freq is 750kHz, for instance). This reduces the efficiency of the circuit substantially, but it keeps size, cost, and complexity low. Maximum output from a tesla coil this small is likely something less than 75kV and would max out in the hundreds of microamps range.<br><br>This means that the plasma generator provides a lower frequency pulsed DC output at lower voltage but with higher current, while the tesla coil provides a larger AC voltage, at higher frequency but much lower current.<br><br>The lower frequency, DC output of the plasma generator is going to do a better job of actually heating up the air in the path of the arc, taking it from a cool but highly ionized gas, to a true plasma. Plasma has *very* low impedance. If  you place the screw driver close to the electrode so a plasma channel forms, you can then draw the screw driver away from the electrode slowly, each pulse forming a new plasma channel in the leftovers from the last, but adding a little bit more to it. Basically, you<sq>re forming a <dq>wire<dq> made of hot ionized gas between the electrode and screwdriver, and the wire can get pretty long before the resistance is too high and the arc stops. You can see the same principle in action by looking up videos of Jacobs Ladders. A small arc is stretched as it rises to become very long.<br><br>For an arc to form in normal air, it requires about 1,100 volts per millimeter of air it has to jump through. When air is ionized, that ratio gets much smaller, perhaps only a few hundred volts per mm, due to lower resistance. Once a true arc (superheated plasma channel) has formed, the resistance is tiny, only a few ohms, and the gap a given voltage can jump increases even more dramatically.<br><br>The tesla coil can produce corona more efficiently because of the higher voltage and higher frequency, however it doesn<sq>t have the peak current necessary to generate really hot plasma channels over long distance. This means that the streamers you<sq>re seeing from the tesla coil are cooler in temperature and higher in resistance than those from the plasma generator.<br><br>It<sq>s also possible the DC nature of the plasma generator can take better advantage of the capacitance provided by the screwdriver and the conductive meatbag holding it (you), essentially just dumping charge in to you where it is then dispersed rather efficiently, compared to the AC waveform that reverses it<sq>s own polarity, requiring the capacitor to continually charge and discharge with each cycle, but that would be a fairly complex interaction, and is more than I<sq>m qualified to comment on.</p>",

Flex circuits do tend to be more expensive than comparable rigid PCBs for the same size and number of layers, especially in prototype quantities. As volume increases the difference narrows. <br>2. Component strain is a huge issue. It is almost always necessary to attach a stiffener to the flex board wherever you place fine pitched components. You can get away with resistors or LEDs on just the flex alone if your bend radius isn<sq>t too small and you align them parallel to your bend axis, but any ICs or other fine pitched components are at a huge risk of getting their connections broke when bending. Stiffeners are commonly used as a <dq>poor man<sq>s rigid-flex<dq> because they allow for similar functionality as rigid-flex but at a cheaper cost, with the downside being you are only able to assemble components on the non-stiffener side. <br>3. Through-hole components are not used in flex circuits for similar reasons, they would eliminate basically all of the advantages of having a flex circuit. Through-hole components are also harder to assemble (assuming you are doing an automatic process) because they traditionally use wave soldering instead of reflow (this is true for rigid PCBs as well). <br><br>Overall, the advantages of flex-only circuits is mainly the reduced weight/thickness that can be achieved, and also the ability to bend in areas where there aren<sq>t any components. In general, you will always need stiffeners where components are to limit the strain on board-component connections. This does limit the usefulness of flex boards, but it depends on your specific needs if flex would be ideal. There is a reason wearables like Fitbit take the approach of having a small rigid board with all of the circuitry and then enclose that in a more flexible casing, as opposed to having the electronics all on flex boards.</p>",

This takes an input current, and outputs a copy of that current scaled up or down (if the voltages allow this - e.g. this won<sq>t happen if voltage across the output transistor is top low). That could be used to drive the pin. <br>* Some kind of built-in current source. Kinda comes back to what fatangaboo was mentioning, but if you need current of a certain precision, you can use a current reference circuit. The simplest but least predictable is just put a resistor and voltage at the <dq>input<dq> of the current mirror - so the input of the current mirror is a constant voltage causing a constant current to flow through a resistor, and the output of the mirror is a constant current. For higher precision, you would use a current reference circuit (you can look this up) that involves a current mirror loop that provides negative feedback on the current, plus a way of injecting some energy into the loop to get it started, plus design considerations that reduce the effect of temperature and process variation on chip. <br>* To make it configurable via software, some kind of switch that disconnects the current mirror output from the actual pin, or disconnects+grounds the gate of the mirror<sq>s output transistor to shut off the current, etc. (not too sure what is most likely in practice) <br>* if the current itself is programmable, you could have a current mirror with multiple output transistors that are binary weighted, with all the outputs tied together (parallel).

                "answer": "<p>If you think about it, an entire computer for $40 is amazing! How important is it to be even cheaper than that?<br><br>You can get cheaper, but then you start getting away from small Linux-based computers (with all the trappings of computers like USB, video, networking, storage, powerful quad-core CPU, 1GB RAM, Linux-compatibility) and into the territory of microcontrollers (limited I/O, CPU, RAM, storage, not Linux compatible).<br><br>I wouldn<sq>t call the Raspberry Pi the gold standard of SBCs; it<sq>s just the most well-known. It has several issues, including lack of on-board storage, reliability issues with SD card and USB, limited Ethernet speeds, no SATA, no analog inputs, no RTC, and limited GPIO. What it does have over the competition is a low price tag and a huge community. The Raspberry Pi was the first really cheap SBC, which made it a hit with hobbyists who weren<sq>t prepared to shell out $100-200 for similar SBCs. But since then, the rest of the market has caught up and several competitors are now available.<br><br>There are lots of more powerful, more expensive boards, but since you are looking for cheaper, I won<sq>t go into those.<br><br>Alternatives for about the same price would include the ODROID C1 (includes gigabit Ethernet, eMMC, IR) and Orange Pi 2 (includes Wi-Fi, IR, SATA, eMMC). <br><br>If you want cheaper, the Raspberry Pi Zero would be great if only you could find it in stock. If you can wait, the C.H.I.P (Wi-Fi, BT, eMMC, runs off LiPo) retails for $9 and will start shipping in June, though I wouldn<sq>t be surprised if it ran into similar issues keeping up with demand. There<sq>s also a Chinese clone of the Raspberry Pi called the Orange Pi. The Orange Pi PC in particular is only $15 and seems to be almost identical to the Raspberry Pi (except a lesser CPU/GPU).<br><br>Getting more into router-level boards, there<sq>s the Seeed LinkIt Smart 7688, which is basically a board from a router but with only Wi-Fi and GPIOs for $15. There<sq>s also a model available that includes an ATmega MCU so you can pair up the basic Linux OS with Arduino sketches. Much slower, less RAM, and less storage than most SBCs, though (it<sq>s a router, not a PC).<br><br>If you don<sq>t need to run Linux or any other ARM-based software, and you can have this device hooked up to an existing PC, then you have a lot more options. An Arduino, or any cheap clone, or for that matter the ATmega microcontroller that is the heart of it, has I2C, GPIO, and can be connected to any computer. Arduino clones can be had for about $10 and the ATmega itself for about $3-5. They aren<sq>t nearly as fast or have as much memory, nor will they run x86 or ARM software (no Linux), but they can run real-time code very well. Depending on what your project entails, the ATmega could be used with motors, lights, sensors, etc, and could communicate with a PC over USB or serial to get information from the star map.<br><br>Another option is the ESP8266, which is tiny, has built-in Wi-Fi, and is also very cheap (about $7). It<sq>s relatively new and isn<sq>t quite as approachable for programming, but it<sq>s the darling for IoT because it<sq>s small, low-power, cheap, and has Wi-Fi.<br><br>And there are many more options. I recommend checking out this list<colon> http<colon>//hackerboards.com/ringing-in-2016-with-64-open-spec-hacker-friendly-sbcs/.<br><br>All told, there are many alternatives to the Raspberry Pi spanning a spectrum of prices and features.

If you aren<sq>t in the market just yet, don<sq>t be surprised to find many more contenders within the next year.</p>",

Then you could rig up a little ratchet shifter design so you could work the driven sprocket through the new ranges provided by using the multispeed sprocket from the bicycle and an armchair mounted lever to work the derailer.

                "answer": "<p>**Multimeter**<br>Many people will recommend Extech but truthfully, their EX series has some of the WORST quality control out of any meter out there. They are made by CEM China with a bare minimum of QC. When they work they are ok, nothing stellar, but the problem is  they have a high rate of DOA from the get go. Instead, the minimum multimeter I would recommend is the Amprobe AM-510 (don<sq>t step up to the 520 or 530, they are a different control IC that has issues). This meter has damn safe input protection (real UL-Listed Fluke level input protection), most of the features you should need including non-contact voltage, a fast continuity function (this is more useful than you realize) and all for $40-50. Next step up is a Fluke 107, not much improved over the AM-510 but it is a Fluke at around $70. Above this, at around $110-130 is the Brymen BM257S, a VERY solid well rounded meter with loads of features. In the $150-200 range is a used 87V, if you can find it. In the $220-240 range is the Brymen BM869S (this meter is freaking awesome, a direct competitor to the Fluke 289 specs wise).<br><br>**Test Leads**<br>You won<sq>t know yet what you need and depending on what you end up doing, you will have to pick the appropriate test leads. Companies like Pamona, ProbeMaster, Fluke, etc. all make VERY good stuff. For many of my basic needs like banana cables, I make my own. I have a relationship with a vendor in Hong Kong, who isn<sq>t usually the cheapest but is an electronics hobbyist himself. He knows how to pick quality parts that are good deals and I trust him VERY much. I value the trust much more than getting the rock bottom cheapest price, because I know what I am getting is solid quality. Plus, shipping from Hong Kong tends to be MUCH faster than shipping from the mainland. I currently am waiting on a whole bunch of stuff from him that is sitting in Flushing, NY (thanks USPS). I can offer his contact info and/or eBay store to anyone that wants it (you can message me) but I prefer not to spam it so won<sq>t post it here.<br><br><br>*Soldering tools*<br><br>**Soldering Iron**<br>For a soldering iron, I have a Hakko FX888D and absolutely love it. You have to be careful though and ONLY purchase it from a reputable retailer (check their list of authorized resellers). The market is flooded with fakes, absolutely flooded. To the point that around 95<percent> of the 120V models on eBay are fake and probably 99<percent> of the 220V models on ebay are fake. Frys recently had the FX888D on sale for $70. One thing I learned, to help keep your tips fresh<colon> always coat your tip in a healthy dose of solder before you turn the iron off. If you turn off your iron with a clean tip, the bare tip is sitting their exposed and oxidizing. If you turn it off with solder on the tip, the solder is exposed and oxidizing. <br><br>**Solder**<br>Go with something like Kester 44. I prefer 63/37 even though it is more expensive because it is a true eutectic solder. This means it is much easier to work with because it doesn<sq>t transition through a pasty region. When you are a beginner, this makes it much less likely that you make bad solder joints because the joint is either liquid or solid, no in between.<br><br>**Flux**<br>You don<sq>t mention flux, you NEED flux. Get some good cheap rosin based flux<colon> http<colon>//www.amazon.com/dp/B005DNR01Q/ref=twister_B008UH4DT4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1<br>It can be very sticky, just like any rosin flux, but it works damn well and at around $10 for 125mL it will last you a LONG time. You can go with some of the other fluxes but remember flux pens are expensive, better to buy a bottle and use a paint brush, syringe or something else of that nature.<br><br>**Tip Cleaner**<br>If you get the FX888D, it has the brass sponge built into the base of the handle stand. If you go with something else<colon><br>http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Hakko-599B-02-Solder-Cleaning-Holder/dp/B00FZPGDLA/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1447255815&sr=1-1&keywords=hakko+brass+sponge<br>Brass sponges work much better than the wet sponge and tend to help promote tip life.<br><br>**Helping Hands**<br>Instead of those helping hands, if you plan on working on boards go for something more like this<colon><br>http<colon>//www.amazon.com/PanaVise-Model-Junior-Miniature-Vise/dp/B000B61D22/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1447254270&sr=1-2&keywords=board+holder<br><br>Those little helping hands are an exercise in frustration. You often end up fighting them more often than not. They fall over, the movement of hte hands is difficult, etc. <br><br><br>*Hand Tools Time*<br><br>**Flush Cutters**<br>Side-Flush cutters are a must. The [Hakko flush cutters](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Hakko-CHP-170-Stand-off-Construction-21-Degree/dp/B017ODDPNO/) are well thought of. You will need to replace them eventually and the price is pretty good for a name brand. Personally, I use Tronex flush cutters but those are an ENTIRELY different ball-game. I tend to get tools that work damn well and last a LONG time (these run around $50 a pair but are a freaking dream to work with). <br><br>**Tweezers/Forceps**<br>ebay is a great place to get NOS tweezers. Look for tweezers made in switzerland. Avoid ones made in Pakistan, those are byfar the cheapest quality. The COO quality tends to go Switzerland (Best) - Italy (Good) - China (OK to crap) - Pakistan (Bargain Basement to Crap). Get a couple of types for easy positioning of pieces. Companies like Erem, Excelta, Ideal-tek etc. <br>,<br>**Screw Drivers**<br>Do NOT cheap out here, you will regret it. These are tools that are not limited to just electronics work. You can use these around the house. As such, their cost is spread across multiple areas. A cheap screwdriver doesn<sq>t fit as well, makes it much more likely you will strip a screw head and in general is just much more difficult to use. You will need both standard size and precision size. Some good companies are Witte, Wiha, Wera, PB Swiss, Snap-On, Mac, etc. For your large size, expect to pay around $30-50 for the set. I have used the Wera Kraftform Plus 334 and frankly REALLY liked them. I have big hands so the handle was my least favorite part but they REALLY grip a screw driver well. For the precision, Wera and Wiha have great tips that really fit the screws well but I find their handles to be a bit rough. I love my Wittron (by Witte) precision handles but the tips aren<sq>t up to the same quality as Wiha and Wera. I have yet to try any companies compact kits but my next major tool purchase it going to be the Wiha 75965 Precision Kit. <br><br>**Needle Nose Pliers**<br>You will need these things, look for a pair with solid grips and little flex. I have Tronex smooth jawed needle nose pliers but they are truthfully overkill for a beginner. I don<sq>t really have a specific recommendation on these because I love my Tronex pliers and haven<sq>t needed to look elsewhere but they are WAY too expensive for what you are doing. <br><br><br>---<br><br><br><br>OK, this should cover everything. Remember, you don<sq>t have to get ALL of this at once. Sometimes you can get by with something cheaper to get the job done, knowing down the road you need to buy quality. For example, cheap chinese test probes can work but at $5 they just aren<sq>t nearly the same as the Pamona 5519A aka Fluke TL-71 (which cost around $17). Good luck and if you or anyone else have ANY questions at all you can message me. <br></p>",

This is straight from Maxwell<sq>s equations amd is exactly the same fundamental reason a transformer works. If you have multiple things connecting to ground it is easy to physically connect them such that it creates a closed loop. Remember that enclosures and frames and such are typically grounded which also contribute to making these loops.<br><br>These loops can be very large. Imagine you have an enclosure with two grounded power cables and you connect each into a different socket on opposite sides of the room. You now have a loop of conductor that goes up one cable, through the enclosure, down the other cable, and all the way back through the building wiring to the earth ground point, then all the way back through the building wire to the first cable.<br><br>This huge area means it only takes a small change in magnetic fields to set up a big current around the loop. Since all conductors have some finite resistance, and ground wires tend to be small and not meant to carry much current, this current easily causes voltage drops across your <sq>ground<sq>.<br><br>To combat this, you either need to break the loop by removing ground lines or using isolators, or arrange the multiple ground lines into a star pattern to a single point(effectively pinching the area of the loop down to zero).</p>",

If you haven<sq>t done it before I do recommend just play around with the parameters a bit and gain an intuitive understanding on what the coefficients do. You might even be able to come up with an acceptable set of coefficients just by trial and error if your requirements are quite relaxed. A simple PI controller might be all you need!

That<sq>s the phrase you are looking for.)  <br><br>Basically the field magnets have a neutral axis which you can call the motor<sq>s geometric neutral axis.  It is the line that goes through the center of the rotor and is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines due to the permanent magnets.  <br><br>However, when current is applied to the voltage and it begins to spin, the coils in the armature have their own magnetic field and they start to skew the geometric axis.  You end up getting a new magnetic neutral axis that is skewed by some angle from the geometric axis.  This new neutral axis changes depending on how much current is flowing in the armature (and if the current is negative - that is, the motor is spinning the opposite way - the magnetic neutral axis is skewed in the opposite direction).<br><br>Ideally, you want your brushes to be aligned with the magnetic neutral axis.  But because the magnetic neutral axis changes with the motor load, this is impossible to do all the time.  So if a motor has to run in both directions or if the motor is just a general purpose DC motor, the manufacturer will align the brushes with the geometric neutral axis.  If the motor only has to run in one direction, the brushes will be aligned with magnetic neutral axis for some load in that direction.  </p>",

Closed loop control is basically any situation where you know what outcome you want, and you have the ability to figure out what your current state is, and you have some means to <dq>steer<dq> things so you can move towards your goal.<br><br>An example may help. Let<sq>s say you are driving in your car and you want to maintain a speed of 55 MPH. There is a speedometer on the dashboard that tells you what your current speed is. And there is a pedal on the floor that you can depress/release to speed up/slow down. Finally, there is your eyes and your brain. Which can look at the speedo, see if you<sq>re going too fast or too slow, and then decide to tell your leg mucles to move your foot in such a way as to depress or release the pedal.<br><br>The whole <dq>look, compare, take action<dq> loop happens over and over again, constantly adjusting, as long as you continue to will it to happen. You might start going up a hill and your speed may start to decline, but you<sq>ll notice the speedo going down and push the pedal a little harder to compensate. Or you might start going downhill and start going too fast, you<sq>ll notice and lift off the pedal to compensate. That<sq>s closed loop control<colon> knowing what you want, being able to tell where you are now, having some form of control that allows you to move to a new state, and continuously adjusting to move towards your goal.<br><br>A linear regulator works on the same kind of principle. It has a target voltage (an internal voltage reference circuit based on a zener diode), a comparator that compares that reference voltage to the actual output voltage, and a <dq>pass transistor<dq> that can allow more or less current to flow to the output.<br><br>So, the theory is really just that simple. The comparison circuit continually monitors the output voltage, and increases/decreases the pass transistor<sq>s output current to compensate for any drop/rise in output voltage. If the voltage at the output falls, it dumps more current into the output to compensate. If the voltage at the output rises, it allows less current to go to the output.<br><br>The only wrinkle here is that the zener diode voltage reference is most accurate (and most stable) when it<sq>s creating a voltage of about 1.25 volts. So instead of comparing the output voltage directly to the reference, you use a voltage divider to divide the output voltage down to 1.25 volts. And then compare the 1.25V reference to that fraction of the output voltage. Everything else works the same.<br><br>The picture here sums it up pretty well<colon> http<colon>//electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/66968/voltage-regulator-with-op-ampnegative-feedback-and-mosfet<br><br>You can see the zener diode based voltage reference, the triangular voltage comparison element, and the R3-R4 voltage divider.<br><br>The current control parts of the circuit are not as simple as they could be. Basically, the voltage comparator controls Q2, which in turn controls Q1, which controls the output current. It would be simpler if the voltage comparator just controlled Q1 directly, but for various practical reasons that doesn<sq>t always work.<br><br>This simplified explanation glosses over a shit-ton of practical issues, of course. There are about a million things that can go wrong in the process, some obvious and some exceedingly subtle. But the above gives you the basic idea.</p>",

Optimized designs are readily available by outsourcing, especially for volume.<br><br>I have no doubt you can make a working design, but please consider the trade offs.<br><br>I would be wary of off the shelf transformers; we almost exclusively get custom designs and there is no shortage of design/build firms.

Pro<colon> Pretty much your only option for power transmission (as opposed to signal transmission). Well-known, can step AC up/down, for efficient power transformation you can use switching converter topologies (AC-AC or AC-DC-DC or DC-DC) that are inherently isolated (e.g. forward converter for DC-DC). Con<colon> Big and heavy (less so for high-frequency DC-DC switching converter). It will let voltage/current spikes right through, up to the point that the magnetic core saturates (so you need additional protection if that is a concern). Failures can be spectacular. Some undesirable effects if you open- or short-circuit the secondary while the primary is loaded.<br>* Current or voltage transformer<colon> Low-power transformers intended specifically for sensing an AC current or voltage and transferring it to the secondary, isolated and usually stepped down for sensing. You can then post-process this (e.g. true RMS converter) and send it to your microcontroller.<br>* Digital opto-isolation. Pro<colon> Incredibly simple, cheap, can protect you from several kilovolt spikes (depends on the chip). You can look at the speed or capacitance specs of each chip to find a fast-enough one, can easily be replaced if you use a DIP with a socket, can be very high speed. Con<colon> Only works for digital (it doesn<sq>t transfer linearly enough for analogue, and temperature/process/age variations hurt precision a lot); the LED transmitter side can die with too much reverse voltage or forward current. Requires separate power supplies on both sides that are isolated from each other, otherwise you have a common ground/power rail and effectively have no isolation.<br>* Analogue opto-isolation<colon> Some companies like Avago produce analog opto-isolators like the HCNR200. Look at the datasheet<colon> the idea is that you have TWO photodiodes, one of them is used along with an amplifier/feedback loop to regulate the current into the LED so that the receiver output is proportional to the input signal (this is non-isolated), and then the other one is used on the isolated side to obtain the signal. Pro<colon> analog! Con<colon> expensive and complex, requires some analogue circuit design to stabilise the loop and ensure sufficient bandwidth (depending on how much performance you need; very low-speed stuff is easy enough).</p>",

                "answer": "<p>A transformer works by converting a voltage on the primary coil to a magnetic flux in the core, then back to a voltage on the secondary coil. The magnetic flux in the core is a function of primary voltage and the number of turns. Here is the relation<colon><br><br><br>    Voltage ~ flux * number of turns<br><br><br>This is important because a transformer<sq>s core can only handle a certain amount of flux. If you exceed the saturation flux, your transformer will not work as advertised.  This means that a 1-turn transformer will be very limited in the amount of voltage it can handle.  This is why very high voltage transformers always have a huge number of turns on them.<br><br><br>    .<br><br><br>Another very important factor when it comes to determining the number of turns is the inductance of the coil. Lets say you want to make a power supply transformer that converts 120V to 12V. What happens when the 12V side has no load while the power supply is plugged in? In that case the transformer<sq>s primary coil acts as an inductor. The inductance of the coil prevents large currents from flowing through the transformer. The inductance of the coil is a function of the number of turns. Here is the relation<colon><br><br><br>    L ~ N2<br><br><br>The current through the inductor is a function of inductance<colon><br><br><br>    I ~ 1/L or I ~ 1/N2<br><br><br>So that means that the current through the inductor goes up by a factor of 100 if you decrease the number of turns by a factor of 10. If your wall transformer has too few turns, the current will cause it to heat up and you may start a fire.<br><br>    .<br><br>There is another factor that I won<sq>t go into too much detail about.  In order to effectively transfer power from the primary to secondary side you need to make sure all of the magnetic flux makes it from one coil, through the magnetic core, and then into the other coil of the transformer.  This is called the coupling factor, or K.  K = 1 means that 100<percent> of the energy in the primary side will make it to the secondary.  If K < 1, then some of the energy has <sq>leaked<sq> out of the system.  If you have a 1<colon>10 transformer with a K = 0.5, then a 1V primary will result in 5V on the secondary instead of 10V.  For various reasons, using a larger number of turns on a transformer will increase K, and using few turns will decrease K.  This means a 1<colon>10 transformer will perform worse than a 10<colon>100 transformer in most cases.<br><br><br>**TLDR<colon> If the number of turns is not chosen correctly you will burn your house down.**</p>",

Reworking a 120v plug is a relatively simple task any decent tech worth their weight in piss should be able to perform without calling an electrician.  Here<sq>s some important points that haven<sq>t been mentioned in previous replys...<br><br>1) Colour codes can vary by country.  Be wary of advice on the internet unless you know it is from somebody who knows your local codes.  [Eg I<sq>m in Canada](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power#Color_codes)<br><br>2) Modern plugs will try to tell you the colour codes they need.  On yours the green wire obviously goes to the green clamp,  the black wire goes to the dark coloured clamp and the light wire goes to the light clamp.<br><br>3)  You can get the black and white wires installed backwards and the AC device will still work just fine.  It won<sq>t run backwards or anything strange.  But there is a safety issue.  If the last guy wasn<sq>t a complete fuckhead then what should be the neutral wire will have almost the same voltage as ground and only the live wire pose a hazard.  To turn the device off you only need 1 switch on 1 of them to break the circuit.  If you wire live and neutral backwards then that switch will be on the neutral and the voltage from live will still be energizing the device through its path until it hits that switch.  Thus creating a potential hazard as a large portion of the device my still be energized even when the switch is off.<br><br>And most importantly...<br><br>4) In reference to my cursing in point 3...  Until you measure it for yourself, always assume that the last guy was a complete fuckhead.</p>",

If reversed, probably still functions as a crappy transistor (less gain, worse voltage withstanding limits).<br><br>MOSFET<colon>  Higher gate threshold voltage, gate never conducts (until it is destroyed from overvoltage), if reversed, always conducts with a diode drop of voltage loss (typically), but you can remove this diode drop by turning the gate on.  The current allowed to pass is controlled by the gate voltage.<br><br>JFET<colon> Low (probably conducts some at zero!) gate threshold voltage, gate conducts ~~some~~ if brought high (low for P-JFET) enough.  When gate is brought into de-activation voltage, it doesn<sq>t conduct (and neither does the transistor).  I<sq>m not sure what happens if you reverse source/drain on a jfet.

                "answer": "<p>It actually uses a transformer instead of an inductor. The primary winding of the transformer first charges (e.g. allows current to flow through it) over a period of time. Sinee it<sq>s connected to the base of the transistor, the transistor turns on and allows current to flow into its collector. This is due to its winding inductance, so it behaves much like an inductor. The secondary winding opposes this increase in current flow (and thus voltage) by providing its own opposite voltage (and thus current). This provides a voltage across the secondary winding. At some point in time, the magnetic field collapses in the primary winding after the current reaches a peak. This then lowers the voltage/current at the transistor base, which causes the transistor to turn off. Since there is already current flowing through the secondary winding, however (and inductors resist the change in current flow), the current is then diverted into the LED at whatever voltage it needs (since it is acting as a current source rather than a voltage source). Once this current eventually decreases (due to the secondary winding discharging its stored energy), the whole process starts over.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Just being able to generate high frequencies will not tell you how the <sq>scope is actually performing at those frequencies.   Because <sq>scope bandwidth rolls off gradually as you surpass the rated frequency (which usually means 3 dB down, or 70.7<percent> of actual amplitude), you need accurate amplitude as well in order to determine where the actual knee point is.  <br><br>To give you an example, I did some poking at my best <sq>scope about a year ago.  I had an oscillator that went to 500 MHz, a 250 MHz FET probe module (the fastest thing I had at the time) and the <sq>scope is rated for 400 MHz.  Up until about ~225 MHz, the amplitude was pretty constant.  Then, it started rolling off as I increased the frequency further.  But until about 460 MHz, I could still detect and display the signal, albeit with greatly reduced amplitude.  Different <sq>scopes have different rates of roll-off with increasing frequency too.  Often it<sq>s not constant either; there<sq>s a slow roll-off as you just pass the 3 dB frequency, then at some point, the attenuation accelerates, then finally drops like a rock.  For the setup I described, that point was about 465 MHz, at which point the signal basically disappeared, even with the highest possible amplification.  <br><br>There exist tools for checking <sq>scope performance.  The relevant one for this particular spec is a Leveled Sine Wave Generator.  Unfortunately, they can be quite expensive.  If you can find someone (locally) who<sq>s willing to let you check the performance of your <sq>scope with theirs, that<sq>d be the best case.  <br><br>Another alternative is that you use a (much faster) <sq>scope you know to be in good calibration as a <dq>transfer standard<dq>.  You can then build anything you like and measure on both <sq>scopes.  Assuming you stay well below the bandwidth limit of the other <sq>scope and its probe, you can treat those measurements as <dq>actual<dq> and what you see on the slower <sq>scope as that system<sq>s performance.  Very much related to that is your choice of probe for the <sq>scope under test.  When probing home-made things, you<sq>ll likely need to stick with a 10X probe to avoid loading the circuit.  This will introduce the probe<sq>s own bandwidth limitations into the system you<sq>re measuring, and if it<sq>s the same as the <sq>scope or less, your results will be the combination of the two systems.  This is why <sq>scope calibration tools usually have 50 \u03a9 outputs and require a 50 \u03a9 pass-thru terminator at the <sq>scope front panel; it eliminates the probe and its associated error.  </p>",

When you do that, some of the electrons from the N-type material and <dq>holes<dq> (think of them as the absence of electrons) from the P type material combine in the middle, making what is called the <dq>depletion region<dq>.

When a free electron recombines with a hole, it gives off a photon that has the energy (more or less) of the difference. For a V_drop of 0.7 V, we can use the calculation 1240 eV nm / 0.7 V = 1771 nm, which is in the infrared. Red light at 750 nm would correspond to a voltage around ~1.7 V, green higher, and blue higher yet (top end of blue is around 3 eV)<br><br>Another reason I think, is insufficient radiative recombination. Silicon is what is known as an *indirect bandgap* material. In a direct-bandgap material, the electron goes from conduction band to valence band and gives off the difference in energy. In an indirect-bandgap material, the electron loses some energy into the material itself (particularly phonons, which a sort of vibration of the crystal lattice). I think for silicon and its low-energy band gaps involved, the extra energy is just heavily-favoured to be absorbed by the lattice.</p>",

[Look at this graph](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File<colon>Diode-IV-Curve.svg) in the forward area. As you can see, from the voltage reaches Vd, the current changes very much. So you need to limit that current to whatever the diode is rated for. It is usually rated for 20mA, but several different types exist. When you limit the current, you will also automatically limit the voltage, because the diode act as a linear device in that area(that means that the diode act as a resistor. A very low-value resistor, but still a resistor). The Vd forward voltage is a factor that is dependent on how the diode is made. Some signal-diodes have 0.5-0.7V voltage drops, some have 1.2V and so on. LEDs have voltage drops depending on their color, from 1.2V to 3.5V or about that(look it up on wikipedia). <br><br>You need to use a resistor to match the current into the LED. Once you do that, the LED will have its forward voltage drop of whatever. So you just need to use Ohms law to calculate what voltage drop the resistor should have to support the voltage drop of the LED, and to only pass the rated current.<br><br>You ask about the pin current rating. It depends on the device. Some will have about 3-8mA, while some will have 25mA. It depends on the device. But you will still need the current limiting resistor. Like any voltage source, the current will only be equal to whatever current you pull. If you have an 8mA pin, you can pull up to 8mA, but also 1mA or 0.532\u00b5A, if thats what you want.</p>",

Above Vf the diode will become a very good conductor and will conduct enough current to destroy itself if it is not limited elsewhere in the circuit. Because of these properties, you can generally subtract the Vf from your available voltage to do your calculations. <br><br>So in short, yes, the LED is essentially changing the voltage (between its anode and cathode). What you are left with (3.3-2.1) will be dropped across the remainder of your circuit, allowing you to use Ohm<sq>s law. <br><br>An idealized LED will always cause a voltage drop of <dq>Vf<dq> when used in its forward conducting mode.</p>",

The other probe accessories attach in the absence of this hat.  <br><br>**Insulating Cap**<br><br>Notice that there<sq>s a bare metal ring near the probe tip, but separate from the actual pointy part of the probe.  This metal is connected to ground, and is used as a contact to shield the inside of the hat (insert tin-foil hat jokes here).  Unfortunately, touching this to certain parts of your circuit when pointy-probing can cause it to poof either the circuit, the probe, or both.  The insulating cap simply covers this ring when you aren<sq>t using the hat.  <br><br>**IC Insulating Cap**<br><br>Same deal as the insulating cap, but with more features.  Notice that the PDF I linked shows a few different ones for different IC pin pitches.  The purpose of these caps is not only to cover the ground ring, but to give you a locator so you can avoid slipping off the pin you want to probe.  The two little nubbins on either side of the pointy probe fit between the IC lead you<sq>re trying to probe and the adjacent ones.  <br><br>**Ground Spring**<br><br>Sometimes, the ground lead that comes with your probe has too much inductance for a very high speed signal.  The ground spring clips onto that same metal ring I talked about earlier, and lets you ground the probe to something very close to the signal you<sq>re trying to probe.  This can give you a better look at high-speed signals that are otherwise distorted by the inductance of the ground lead.  <br><br>**BNC Adapter**<br><br>If the signal you<sq>re trying to probe happens to be on a BNC cable, or a BNC jack, and you want to avoid breaking the shielding in order to probe the signal, you can use a BNC adapter to turn your probe into a BNC connector.  This helps to avoid the introduction of extra noise into your measurement.  <br><br>The reason to not just connect the BNC coax right to your <sq>scope is that you may end up loading the source you<sq>re trying to probe.  Remember that <sq>scopes typically have 1 M\u03a9 (megaohm) input impedance, but common 10X <sq>scope probes have a 10 M\u03a9 input impedance, and less effective capacitance than a plain BNC cable.  <br><br>Hope that helps!</p>",

It won<sq>t be exactly those numbers, but if it<sq>s significantly less than that, or significantly more than that (maybe 32ohms as an extreme upper limit) then the speaker could be dead (which is not impossible, the wires are quite small in those).<br><br>If none of those things identify the culprit then the problem is likely something else inside; the fact that there<sq>s no sound at all, not even a hiss or hum, implies it<sq>s either the speaker or all the power tubes or something in the high voltage supply.<br><br>You could do a quick diagnosis yourself; pull all the tubes, take the chassis out, and use a multimeter to check the plate voltages on the sockets. The voltages will be in the 300-600volt range so you<sq>ll have to be extremely careful, but it will help you see if voltage is getting where it should. <br><br>Hopefully this will get you started... you can at least eliminate a few problems that way, and maybe even solve it. <br><br>$90 to get it checked out is a bit extreme. <br><br>Where do you live? It<sq>s pretty likely that you can find someone with some electronics knowledge who can fix it, chances are the problem is pretty minor and within case-of-beer-as-payment difficulty level for someone. Or you can just google some tube-amp testing and repair guides, because as long as it<sq>s not any of the solid state gubbins that went bad, there<sq>s not really that many bits that can actually go wrong.<br><br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>This is actually my field!<br><br>The most simple photoconductive antennae are really quite straightforward. You have an electric field applied across a suitable semiconductor (often low-temperature grown gallium arsenide (LT-GaAs)) by two metal contacts - typically separated by tens or hundred of microns. Then you illuminate the semiconductor in the gap with a very short laser pulse. We use a 100 femtosecond pulse from an 800nm Ti<colon>Sapphire laser if you want to look into it.<br><br>The photon wavelength from the laser relates to an energy greater than the bandgap of the semiconductor (E=hv), and so charge carriers are excited in the illuminated region. The electric field that we applied then accelerates the charge carriers, so the switch conducts for a very short period of time - a few picoseconds. This is because the carrier lifetime in LT-GaAs is so short that the briefly excited carriers quickly recombine.<br><br>As you say in your question, the detectors work in much the same way, but the electric field is applied by the transmitted THz instead of a normal power supply. You measure the resulting current when the switch is illuminated to determine the magnitude of the THz-field at that moment in time.<br><br>Check my sketch of a basic free space THz transmission system [here](http<colon>//imgur.com/a/kqPBV)<br><br>Imaging can be done in many ways, I<sq>m familiar with two common methods.<br><br>You can simply raster scan the object that you want to image. If you have your terahertz beam focused to a point, as I do in that image, then you can move the sample around in the focus and then you have an idea of the terahertz transmission properties at each point.<br>Alternatively, you can do some clever image processing with coded masks [like this](https<colon>//youtu.be/_ezhdhHNku0) to allow your single pixel detector to image across a broader area.<br><br>Sorry if I<sq>ve confused you - but I<sq>m in the process of writing my thesis on this stuff, so I<sq>m likely to just babble on to anyone who will listen.

This phenomenon is called electroluminescence. Solar panels are a good example of this. Shine light on them and they will convert that light into electricity.
