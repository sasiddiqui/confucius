                "answer": "<p>For now I guess it<sq>s too soon to fully understand this but it might be useful along the way <colon><br><br><br>> <dq>Alright, here goes. I<sq>m old. What that means is that I<sq>ve survived (so far) and a lot of people I<sq>ve known and loved did not. I<sq>ve lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can<sq>t imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here<sq>s my two cents.<br><br>> I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don<sq>t want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don<sq>t want it to <dq>not matter<dq>. I don<sq>t want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can<sq>t see.<br>As for grief, you<sq>ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you<sq>re drowning, with wreckage all around you. <br><br>> Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it<sq>s some physical thing. Maybe it<sq>s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it<sq>s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don<sq>t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you<sq>ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what<sq>s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.<br><br>> Somewhere down the line, and it<sq>s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O<sq>Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you<sq>ll come out.<br><br>> Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don<sq>t really want them to. But you learn that you<sq>ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you<sq>ll survive them too. If you<sq>re lucky, you<sq>ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.<dq> - /u/GSnow<br><br>My condolences.<br><br>EDIT <colon> Np guys, I keep it for everyone who needs it when I see it.</p>",

Then you get blue balls from some hot conservative girl winking at you and flashing her panties under her skirt and making sexy faces and blow job motions to you while you were going through some airport or public event, and when you passed by and shook her hand she leans in whispering she is going to diddle her clit thinking about you tonight and how much she wants to suck your dick off, just to fuck with you. Then you try to look up some porn when you get home just to relieve the tension but you just know the CIA is monitoring and 3 other govornment agencies are watching you beat off. Then you finally break down and Jack off in the shower which sets off some fucking biohazard drain alarm and the entire place is on lock down until they can find the source of the specimen and you end up getting debriefed by the joint chiefs of staff about your masturbatory habits and how you almost created a national security issue with your dick. Then wikileaks leaks your search history showing you looked up penis enlargement techniques when it was actually just some click bait you<sq>d accidentally clicked and TYT spends all next week talking about your supposed micro penis.

                "answer": "<p>Child of divorce, professional who dealt with divorcing couples for many years, Adult who went through a divorce, remarried and volunteer counseling/mentoring for couples today.<br><br>Here are the most common mistakes I<sq>ve seen (my own as well as collectively) in the failed and struggling marriages I<sq>ve seen<colon><br><br>* One or both spouses have unresolved childhood baggage issues that will rear its head in their adult relationships.  Examples of these include (but not limited to) physical or emotional abuse/neglect in the home; sexual abuse; one or both parents had substance abuse/addiction issues; one or both partners came from a divorced or single parent household.  Among the many reasons why this is such a significant factor is if you grow up in a dysfunctional environment, you have no idea how dysfunctional and unhealthy it really is.  To you, its normal, it is all you<sq>ve ever known.  So if Mom and Dad resolved conflict by getting drunk, yelling at each other and then not speaking for days, guess what you have a chance of modeling as an adult in your own relationships?  <br><br>* Understanding what <dq>marriage as a priority<dq> really means.  When you get married, your marriage has to be the main priority in your life.  Not your career, not your spouse (i.e. don<sq>t put them on a pedestal), not your kids, not your hobbies or your personal fitness.  The fact is, when you get married, you no longer get to call all of the shots.  Gotten used to staying up all night playing XBOX with your boys on weekends?  Not going to work in a marriage for an extended period of time.  You<sq>re going to have to accept the fact that if you want to have a healthy marriage, compromise is your new word of the day.  In some cases you may have to give things up entirely, or learn to say <dq>no for now.<dq>  While this often tends to be more of a struggle for men, women can also struggle with this issue.  I<sq>m not saying that getting married means giving up you completely, or kiss all of your favorite activities goodbye.  What I am saying is, if you want your marriage to be healthy, you now have someone else in your life who gets an equal (not dominant--equal) say in how you spend your free time.  <br><br>* Poor communication skills.  A shockingly high number of adults lack basic healthy communication skills and conflict resolution skills.  Its heart breaking to have conversations with struggling couples who won<sq>t speak to each other with a kind word for any reason.  Both spouses should feel that their marriage is the one safe place in the world for each other.  Unfortunately, in many instances, it is the last place a spouse can go for emotional safety.  If you don<sq>t feel your partner is your first friend, your best friend, your most trusted friend, then something is broken in your communications with each other.  <br><br>* Vastly different backgrounds.  Don<sq>t get me wrong.  Anyone can be successfully married to someone else if both people are committed to it and willing to work on it.  But most of the time, that<sq>s just not the case.  Societal/familial pressures are real, and it is important to assess them if you find yourself  in a relationship that is impacted by them.  Are you dating a trust fund baby/very wealthy child and you are the Jack Dawson?  Tread carefully.  It makes a great movie, but statistically, Rose winds up marrying Cal far more often than running off with Jack, because she doesn<sq>t want to deal with the family pressure or get cut off financially.  Sorry, that<sq>s reality, not the movies.  <br><br>* Similar to different backgrounds, different motivations in life.  Do you know what your partner wants out of life?  Do they aspire to be an artist who welds clown sculptures out of mufflers?  That<sq>s great, but will it support the two of you, and if it won<sq>t, will you be okay supporting them while they<sq>re making Pennywise the Dual Exhaust Killer? Do they want to be a stay at home parent?  Are you okay being the sole breadwinner?  What if it is the reverse?  <br><br>* One.  Union.  Combined. Together.  This notion is one that I see a lot of guys--especially high wage earners who are the sole income for the family--stumble over.  Whether you are religious or not, the fact is when you get married you are no longer two individuals.  You<sq>re one.  The law sees you that way, the tax code (at least in the US) sees you that way, and society sees you that way.  There is no such thing as <dq>mine and yours<dq> in a marriage.  There is only <dq>ours.<dq>  The faster you get that concept nailed down, the better off you<sq>ll be.  I<sq>ve seen many marriages collapse just over this issue alone.<br><br>* Marriage is not an event, its a journey.  So many couples stop trying to pursue each other after the wedding day.  Guys and girls do this.  Stereotypically/historically, men tend to focus on their careers/making money;  women tend to focus on raising the children and/or managing the household.  (I realize not in every situation)  Both spouses stop taking time to compliment each other, appreciate each other, go out on dates, weekend getaways, or generally just spending time chasing after each other.  They take each other for granted and begin to drift apart.  <dq>We just fell out of love<dq> is one of the most common phrases I hear in couples struggling, and the sad thing is, its one of the easiest traps to avoid.  <br><br>* Friends and family around the marriage.  This is especially hard for people who come from dysfunctional families.  When you get married, your new spouse automatically gets moved to the front of the line.  In front of your parents, siblings, lifelong besties, etc.  They<sq>re great to have in your life, but all of them have to take a distant back seat to your new spouse.  If you<sq>re a guy who has had a doting mother all your life and she<sq>s told you what to do, who to marry, where to go to college, etc, you have a tough job ahead of you.  The Monster-In-Law stereotype exists for a reason.  If your new wife turns pale when your Mom<sq>s number pops up on your cellphone, you need to talk to your wife and find out what boundaries she<sq>d like to have installed.  If you are Daddy<sq>s little girl and nobody has ever been good enough in your Dad<sq>s eyes, its time for you to tell Dad that you<sq>re so grateful for his love and support, but Jim is more than good enough in your eyes, so you need him to be in his eyes, too. And sadly, if you have friends or family members who are toxic to you or your marriage, you may be forced to make a very difficult decision in your life.  Anyone who sits around bitching about how much they hate their life, their spouse, their kids or how you<sq>re going to eventually feel the same way about yours--put distance between you as fast as you possibly can.  We tend to adopt the attitudes of the company we keep.  So if you spend all your time with negative people...guess where you<sq>re going to be mentally?<br><br>* Date to establish trust.  Time is actually your friend, not your enemy.  Do not ignore ANY red flag you see in a relationship.  Examine it for what it is, then determine if it is something you can work through with the other person, or is it something they refuse to acknowledge or deal with?  If you<sq>re dating someone who is selfish and they refuse to see it, they will not magically become unselfish because you were kind enough to marry them.  ***Red Flags ignored in dating will become the rocks upon which your marriage boat smashes in the coming storms.***  If there are multiple red flags and they won<sq>t talk to you about any of them, walk away.  It doesn<sq>t matter if you<sq>ve already moved in, share the bank account, the dog, and a car.  Get out now.  If they<sq>re not willing to work on things that impact the security of a relationship today, you can count on them not working on them after you get married.<br><br><br>Marriage is not easy.  It requires a lot of work sometimes, even when you are both on the same page, have great communication, great sex (which will happen very easily if the rest of the relationship is healthy by the way) and great chemistry.  People get sick, they get laid off, their family members die, children get sick, get hurt in accidents, friends have affairs, get divorced...life is challenging and it impacts our relationships, sometimes in ways we<sq>re not expecting or prepared for.  If you<sq>re not willing to value your marriage above everything else in your life, its going to be really hard for it to survive the day in and day out challenges of living.<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>When I turned 21 I became an EMT and began working 911 response in Detroit. I don<sq>t do that anymore, but I keep very close to me two letters that I was sent by a hospital after two particularly difficult runs. The letters are a little weird honestly, half congratulations on a job well done, half a follow up to let me know what happened with the patients.<br><br>The first was a mother who<sq>d been stabbed in the arm. It wasn<sq>t a terribly large wound, but the placement was just so that the knife shredded her brachial artery, and she lost blood incredibly quickly. My partner and I were two kids in our twenties, suddenly dealing with a woman dying as her kids looked on. Once we got her in the ambulance, away from the children, she seized my eyes with hers and asked me <dq>am I gonna die?<dq> and as I promised her she wouldn<sq>t, she stopped breathing and had a seizure. The ride to the hospital was a blur, I was driving while trying to radio in a report to the hospital, when suddenly my partner yells that she<sq>s breathing again. About two minutes later we pulled up to the hospital and that was that. We<sq>d done it. We<sq>d saved that woman<sq>s life. There wasn<sq>t a shadow of doubt in my mind. My partner started crying after we got back in the rig as I drove home and kept saying to him <dq>you did it man, you fucking saved her<dq>. It was the last call of our shift, we cleaned up the ambulance and went home.<br><br>The second run was a motorcycle accident. There was a crowd of people before we even arrived and the police strobe lights were bouncing off the pavement, highlighting the damp patches and streaks. Our patient hadn<sq>t worn a helmet, or gloves, or boots, his only protection was his leather vest, covered in local gang patches, though several were ripped away as he was flung from his seat and skidded almost 50 yards from where his bike lay. He was unconscious, he had obvious fractures in his skull, and he was breathing maybe two or three times a minute with the kind of ragged, heaving respirations that let you know something<sq>s properly wrong. We did what we could, but the problems he had you can<sq>t fix with a basic life support rig and elbow grease. My partner drove fast, I kept him breathing, we dropped him off to the hospital knowing it<sq>d be a miracle if he survived. I mean he was already on his way out and we didn<sq>t even have the full bill of what was killing him. When we got back in the ambulance we knew we<sq>d done our jobs, and we knew that kid would die, we didn<sq>t have to say anything. It was the last run of our shift, we cleaned, we smoked, we went home.<br><br>A month or so later I got my letters. I had to read them several times through to even make sense of them as they were so cryptic, but my eyes settled on a certain sentence<colon> <dq>Jane Doe was found pulseless post-surgery<dq>. The mother died. And on the next one<colon> <dq>John Doe was stable post surgery and is beginning recovery.<dq> The gang member lived.<br><br>There<sq>s that saying that the opposite of love isn<sq>t hate, it<sq>s apathy. In that moment, reading those letters, I felt the full weight of the world<sq>s apathy, and I was absolutely crushed beneath it.<br><br><br>Edit<colon> Thanks for the overwhelming response guys, I<sq>m so glad that people were moved by these experiences and I was able to shine a little light on EMS. It<sq>s a demanding job that<sq>s often forgotten amidst conversations about firefighters and police. I<sq>m definitely gonna try to respond to any questions/comments once I have some free time.

She died last year, so I can<sq>t ask her what got her through.. but I remember some things she said about getting through it over the years. <br>I remember she cried . A lot. She had my grandma as emergency back up because sometimes she just couldn<sq>t cope and she needed to be able to call someone to come get the baby. It sounds like you<sq>ll have that and like you know that you<sq>ll need it... never be too afraid to call, anytime. Babies are tough. A baby while you grieve and mourn and eventually become unnumb... it<sq>ll be a rollercoaster. There will be times you will be unable to care. There will be times that the baby will be all that gets you through too. <br><br>For now all you can do is get through one day. Just work on getting through today. Tomorrow you worry about tomorrow. <br> <br>From observation, I can say that if you can just get through day by day, you guys will be alright. My mom and I had a pretty wonderful life. I know its not the same.. but its kinda comparable. Maybe? I dunno. She didn<sq>t think she could do it. She was 23 and dealing with being a widow and having a preemie and it seemed like way too much. I was born almost ten weeks early 34 years ago and the doctors told her I would die. She told them no one else was going to die. She once told me that that was all she would say to them, that I would be fine . Sometimes I think I lived through her will alone. <br><br>They<sq>ve come a long way with preemies in 30 years. Statistics and numbers dont fucking matter. You need to know that no matter what the doctors tell you that that baby will be a fighter. <br>Last year at 56 she died. And while she was being sick and refusing to believe that was going to happen she kept telling me <dq>nothing happens to me that I can<sq>t handle. So dont worry about it. I<sq>ve never had anything go so wrong that I couldn<sq>t handle it. <dq><br>Im sure she didn<sq>t know it at the time - but the same goes for you. One day you will look at your son and see that giving up was never an option. <br><br>Its ok not to be strong. Honestly..  you need to know its ok to fall apart lay in bed and cry til you puke. Get stupid drunk til you can sleep. Eat or don<sq>t eat. Try not to cause any long term damage. No decisions you cant undo. <br><br>Eventually you<sq>ll need to make some rules about grief so you can get through the day and not accidentally forget the baby at the grocery store. <br><br>My mom gave herself half an hour a day to cry and be angry and say she couldn<sq>t fucking handle it. And then she made herself get up and deal . Growing up I dont remember her being sad.. so I guess that need faded in time. <br><br>I dont know. Im a chick, so I dont know how a man might handle it. But I think there<sq>s no right or wrong way to get through this... but for now get through the hour, or the day. Get to the next save point and just take it from there. <br></p>",

Think before you say it. When talking about things<colon> <br><br>* Do not blame the person. This will make them defensive and tend to yell. <br>* Do not bring up old arguments. Leave the past in the past. <br>* Talk when you are calm and you are not stressed out. If you begin to get agitated, say something like <dq>I am too angry to talk now, but I will be back in an hour to talk more about this.<dq> Then leave, take a walk, get an ice cream, do something. <br>* Use <dq>I<dq> statements. Ex<colon> <dq>When the garbage is not emptied every day, it stinks, and I feel like you are not holding up your promise to empty the garbage.<dq> Or <dq>I feel hurt when you don<sq>t talk to me.<dq><br>* Compromise. Ask for something realistic and be ready to compromise on it. Each person has to get their needs met. <br>* You are not the center of the universe. Your partner has needs too. Ask them what they are. You are not expected to be a mind reader. <br>* Learn about yourself and your needs. Only when you know yourself can you ask your partner to help you meet your needs. <br><br>*****<br><br>**About Compatibility**<br><br>Issues of compatibility from an American<sq>s point of view. <br><br>People who want a long term relationship (LTR) should focus on compatibility. Because no matter how much you love them, they will not change unless they want to. And their differences can be sources of constant disagreements. <br><br>The top 3 issues couples fight most about<colon> sex, money, kids, in no particular order. <br><br>**Sex**<br><br>1. How often to have sex. <br>2. How kinky to get. <br><br>Studies show that if one really wants sex, and they don<sq>t get it, they get very irritable. This can lead to more stress and fighting. Thus, you could say sex is a need for some people. But it is not like food. If you don<sq>t get sex you will not die, but you will be very unhappy. <br><br>Sex can be a time for intimate bonding and sharing, so many people, men and women, need sex for emotional issues. If emotional needs do not get met, more stress and fighting ensue. <br><br>**Money**<br><br>1. How much to spend on a house. When to buy a house. Should we put 10<percent> down? 20<percent> down? 1<percent> down? <br>2. How much of an emergency fund to have. <br>3. How much debt is acceptable. <br>4. Should we pay off debt first or get a basic emergency fund started? <br>5. How often to buy a new car? Should the car be <dq>new new<dq> or just used and new to us? <br><br>People fight a lot about money. One person is fine having lots of debt, while debt can cause anxiety attacks in the partner. Some compromise must be made. But the very nature of compromise is that no party is happy. Neither gets what they really want, but but get part way there. <br><br>Talk about money with your SO if you think things are getting more serious, and you might consider spending your life with them. Never wait until after committing to discuss something so important, and commonly fought about.<br><br><br>**Kids**<br><br>1. When/If to have them. <br>2. How many to have. <br>3. How to discipline them. <br>4. What to teach them about material things. <br>5. How hard to push them in school, sports, extra curricular activities. <br><br><br>**Other issues***<br><br>The more you have in common, the more likely your relationship will last. So a couple should have bother **interests** and **attitudes** in common. <br><br>**Interests**<br><br>These include hobbies, music, TV shows, activities they can do together to spend time together. <br><br><br>**Attitudes**<br><br>This includes attitudes about politics, religion, how to raise kids, how to deal with money. It covers many of the issues in the top 3 things couples fight about. <br><br>*****<br><br>**Elements of a Healthy Relationship**<br><br>**Clear communication**<br><br>* They ask for something when they need it. They don<sq>t keep it bottled up inside then explode when their needs are not met.<br>* They don<sq>t expect their partner to have ESP and read their mind.<br><br>**Proper Disagreements**<br><br>* They can calmly talk about things they disagree about without calling names, bringing up weaknesses, falling back on past transgressions, or making personal insults.<br>* They stop discussion if one or more parties is too upset to talk, but resume when they have calmed down.<br>* Try not to go to bed angry. Resolve the issue before going to bed.<br><br>**They admit they are wrong**<br><br>* They admit when they are wrong, and apologize for it. They do not try to pass blame on to someone else.<br><br>**Acceptance**<br><br>* They accept their partner for who they are and do not try to change them.<br>* It is unrealistic thinking one person can change their partner. The partner has to do the changing.<br>* Forgive your partner for making mistakes. They are not perfect and neither are you. <br><br><br>**Supportive**<br><br>* The person is supportive of the partner in good times and bad.<br>* The person understands and tries to meet the partner<sq>s needs, emotionally, spiritually, physically, and otherwise.<br><br>**Follow through**<br><br>* If they say they are committed and exclusive, they don<sq>t cheat on you. <br>* If they say they are going to do something, they do it. <br><br>**Independence**<br><br>* Your SO is not responsible for your happiness. You are. If you have a problem, step up and ask for your SO<sq>s support. They cannot give you support if you don<sq>t ask for it. <br><br>EDIT<colon> Thanks for the gold whoever!

If you<sq>re perfectly happy with the dating life and relationships you<sq>re getting by sitting back and letting the guy make the moves then by all means keep doing what<sq>s working, but if you<sq>re not you should understand that asking out a guy is a valid option.

It means that what a woman feels as the ups and downs, the mystery, the unknown, the excitement, etc., all things that define <dq>blossoming<dq> love, are things that happen *to* her. She is passive, she is the recipient. Her agency is contained in her response to these things.<br><br>But for a man, anything that makes <dq>love<dq> progress (or regress) pretty much directly stems from one of his actions. He does something or initiates and a woman responds/reciprocates. Because he does not have the gendered luxury of taking a backseat or passive role and watching things happen (if he does, nothing will; the woman will lose interest), he begins, by necessity, to view love as the cause and effect relationship that it more accurately is in reality (he does something, woman responds).<br><br>Seeing something like this takes a ton of the <dq>magic<dq> out of it. Compare it to seeing the sun rise every day. It becomes a lot less mystical, exciting, and dramatic when you know exactly why it happens and can simply see it for the cause and effect relationship that it truly is... you may even begin to take it for granted.<br><br>**This is why romance eventually becomes well... unromantic for men.

                "answer": "<p>* It<sq>s not considered <sq>manly<sq> to like romance or especially stories about romance. Hollywood is as middle-of-the-road as it gets, they<sq>re not going to risk money by making movies that the target audience might be embarrassed to go watch.<br><br>* Romantic comedies are all catered to women. The female character initially resists the male character, but after much effort from him and showing her how much he really loves her, she is eventually overwhelmed by his affections and they live happily ever after. This ties in with the way in which many women perceive romantic interactions - they want to put up a front of resistance only to eventually be won over. No I won<sq>t sleep with him on the first 2 dates, but gosh by the third date he<sq>s just so charming I will sleep with him now. They want to see a guy passing shit tests. Men don<sq>t want to watch a movie about a guy being shit tested.<br><br>* There are a few movies tailored to the male perspective. The best example is the original **American Pie**. 4 teenage boys make a pact to lose their virginities. Along the way, they just happen to find love as well. This really speaks to a lot of young men and what they<sq>re looking for. You want to play the field and get laid, but you kinda want to find the right person as well.<br><br>* As outlined in the above 2 points, men don<sq>t want to see a fictional romance <sq>slowly build<sq>. Most of us don<sq>t like the idea of having to work for months/years to win over a woman. We want to be compatible with someone and have things just work from the beginning.

I held her handle and eased it down, leaving her to do her thing.<br><br>Grabbing another beer, a gust blew by as a shiver creeped up my arm. Odd for July, but I didn<sq>t think too much of it. I returned outside to my shady spot with a new brew in hand. <br><br>On occasion, I<sq>d check on her to make sure she didn<sq>t need a beer and rotating as need be. After 15 scentual minutes of my nose teasing my stomach, I opened her up one final time to receive her gifts. I let her cool off as I went inside to catch a game of sportsball and eat my meal.<br><br>Leaving my mind inside on my sportsball game, I never paid mind the the weather advisory. Half an hour passed while, oblivious to me, a storm swooped in like a sky whale chomping on krill. The satelite tv  signal cut out and I glanced outside. In my neglect, I gasped as I saw her cover, thrown aside. I couldn<sq>t bear the thought of betrayal, I opened the door to the torrential downpour, a wall of my transgressions.<br><br>Drenched after the first step, I sprinted to the cover. How could I let this happen? I left my grill out to ~~dry~~ cool off and was so wrapped up in my selfishness. I had neglected her after all she had done for me. I grabbed her cover, giving it a few shakes and threw it over her. Then and only then did I run back inside.<br><br>Thunder crackled as I closed the door. Could I have done this earlier? Would she forgive me? She was steaming angry. After a while, the steaming subsided; she had let it all out. She was dry and I was still soaked. I went in to change, relieved just to had covered her in time. <br><br>Yet, I realized I had mitigated damagd. It was a mistake, but I had corrected it. The next time I grilled, she wouldn<sq>t suffer any rust or water damage. We could stay together longer and I could look forward to another day spent with my grill</p>",

We all stereotype men as being <dq>all about sex<dq> without realizing that sex is the primary way a man feels emotionally close to his partner.<br><br>Women get emotional fulfillment from their friends, etc. Men usually ONLY get that kind of close, emotional bond with an SO. It<sq>s the ONLY source of that we have. For many men, our SO is the only person we can show our weaknesses to, the only person we can let inside our guard, inside our armor.<br><br>That<sq>s why we are so desperate at times for female companionship. Imagine if an important vitamin only came in one type of fruit, and couldn<sq>t be made synthetically. You would do just about anything to get that one kind of fruit, because it<sq>s your ONLY SOURCE.<br><br>It<sq>s interesting, men like to tell ourselves that we are not emotional about sex, which seems to be true, since we seem to be far more willing to have it. But this overlooks a crucial factor.<br><br>We are more eager to have sex because our emotional reasons for wanting it are far STRONGER than for women, not weaker.<br><br>Of course, hormones factor in a bunch too, I<sq>m just saying that I think, at least for a good portion of men, the emotional side of it (even if they don<sq>t realize it), serves a larger role.<br><br>So, to answer your question.

Well now I have a choice. I can go back on my word, or I can miss out on a great meal.<br><br>You<sq>re in a similar situation. I think a better stance is <dq>I<sq>m only going to be as physically intimate with a man as I am emotionally comfortable.<dq> That<sq>s pretty safe. It means you don<sq>t set yourself up for one-night stands, promiscuous behavior and low-self-esteem stuff. It also means that you<sq>re going to encourage him to deepen the emotional connection.<br><br>Whatever you think, your virginity is not something precious. Your virginity is the lack of something. What<sq>s truly precious is your intimacy. Letting someone know the real you. The you that makes you vulnerable and release to the point of orgasm. That<sq>s what is precious. I agree that you don<sq>t want to throw that away on just anyone. I<sq>m one of those who had sex with a woman for the first time on her wedding night. It<sq>s not just about not knowing if you<sq>re sexually compatible. We were sexually compatible. What we weren<sq>t is, on that night, intimate. It was horrible. It<sq>s a misunderstanding that has haunted me. I<sq>ve since worked past it and I understand better.<br><br>So what I<sq>d say is try thinking about the question not from the point of view that you have a thing, and you<sq>re choosing to give it to your husband. Think of it as<colon> you<sq>re a person. You want to be intimate with someone who really understands you. Not the good you that you want to think you are. The real you that you<sq>re embarrassed to show anyone else.<br><br>When you find that person (and it<sq>s possible there<sq>s more than one), the sexuality will be a natural extension of your relationship with him.<br><br>edit<colon> oh wow!

                "answer": "<p>We<sq>ve been married for 16 years. We<sq>ve both gotten a bit rounder than we used to be, but what isn<sq>t hotter has grown warmer. I have to admit I never really understood how growing older would be when I was younger. Let me see if I can explain what I mean.<br><br>When I see my wife now, it<sq>s like looking at a person in a time warp. She has a certain smile that takes me back to a memory of our honeymoon. There is a mischievous grin that puts me inside a moment when we were still dating. She has these little hairs that curl right below her ear that make me think of the first morning I woke up with her next to me.<br><br>There are so many layers now; such a deep, wonderful complexity about how she makes me feel when I see her. She<sq>s like a succulent dish that has been prepared by a master chef. Or a rich, velvety wine with that perfect blend of buttery smoothness and dry finish. She is my heart, my love, truly my better half. She helps me to be the kind of man and father I<sq>ve always wanted to be.<br><br>Am I attracted to her? Oh, god, yes. No matter how we look now, I see her across all the years as a kind of gestalt vision of who she is and what she means to me. She is the most interesting and attractive person I<sq>ve ever had in my life. No one else even comes a close second.<br><br>-----<br><br>Post-frontpage edit<colon><br><br>Hello, my name is Tony. I<sq>m not sharing anything that a [google search](https<colon>//www.google.com/search?q=dagoodboy) wouldn<sq>t reveal, particularly since DaGoodBoy has been my handle online since the 90s. I<sq>ve been on this site for seven years and never expected to ride this particular roller coaster myself. All I did was write this little comment, then I went back to work. Later on I went home and helped my wife get the kids in bed. About 9pm I finally sat down with my computer and discovered... this.<br><br>I had considered hiding the comment text in a note as /u/WeeMiniMoose suggested, but that was when this was just a little post in /r/AskMen. After seeing what had happened last night I immediately shared it with my wife. She got a little weepy, but the first thing she said to me was that I should have capitalized God in the last paragraph. If you knew her you<sq>d understand why I laughed then. It was exactly the kind of response I expected. We had lunch together today and she took my phone to read all her favorite responses to me. It was lovely and I thank you all for helping make our lunch special.<br><br>She knew this already, you know. I<sq>ve told her things like this pretty often. You can peruse my history and [see](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/BreakingDad/comments/1ln6xy/its_the_nagging_that_sucks/cc0wdbw) that I<sq>ve [said](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1l9xpf/men_over_30_did_you_hold_the_opinion_that/cbx5qpv) these kind of [things](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1kqogs/i_would_love_some_stories_on_how_you_guys_met/cbrq42e) few [times](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1jhsio/whats_the_weirdest_thing_that_turns_you_on/cbet8tb)over the [years](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/17xpl1/our_peers_are_all_3040_year_old_couples_with/c89t4as). She doesn<sq>t use Reddit, so I usually just share them with her in the evenings as we unwind. Being on the front page here doesn<sq>t mean too much to her, but I<sq>m humbled that you all felt strongly enough to put me there.<br><br>For all the kind things being said, I<sq>m nothing special, believe me. I used to [party a bit](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/4gTVm.jpg), but then I met my wife and [we got married](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/bPmvD3Q.jpg). We<sq>ve had our share of ups and downs, including starting a business together, coming close to bankruptcy, downsizing our home, dealing with infertility, and finally starting our family the year I turned 40. I<sq>ve fumbled my way along doing my best to love her, but I<sq>m also the first to admit that our success in life is as much luck as it<sq>s been hard work. It also has more to do with the fact that she forgives me when I mess up than how much I manage to do right.<br><br>I<sq>ve read all the responses and private messages you<sq>ve sent. Some have made me smile, others have broken my heart. Two comments here really spoke to me of my married experience. The first was the [comment](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1lne63/married_men_of_reddit_are_you_still_sexually/cc15rc4) that /u/gazork_chumble_spuzz shared. The second [comment](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1lne63/married_men_of_reddit_are_you_still_sexually/cc145va) was the one that /u/tzchaiboy shared. Both spoke about the effort that goes into making it work. That has been the key for us. Thanks for giving me a wonderful day!</p>",

For the first few years, it wasn<sq>t a big deal. She suffered some fatigue, but that was about it. She still turned me on like crazy, sex was monkey-bar-swingset awesome!<br><br>In our fifth year, she went through some extreme stress after being fired from her job. It devastated her, and I personally blame it for the massive flare-up she suffered from her MS. It came and went over the next few years until we got where we are today<colon> she<sq>s mostly bedridden, has trouble with pretty simple tasks like dressing, hygiene, etc. She put on some serious weight from both being bedridden and the numerous times she was on steroids to treat her flareups.<br><br>On top of all that, she lost a great deal of control of her bowels and bladder. While she can usually tell when she has to move her bowels, there<sq>s been more accidents than I care to remember. Accidents in public, accidents in the middle of the night (pretty frequent), accidents in the middle of romantic times - you name it, it<sq>s happened.<br><br>Her bladder control is worse - mostly non-existent. She<sq>s [catheterized](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_catheter) most of the time because of this. And because she<sq>s catheterized so often, she develops bladder/urinary/vaginal infections CONSTANTLY. She<sq>s twice been hospitalized with [blood poisoning](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_poisoning), once it was very serious - she could have died. And that comes on with no warnings, since she<sq>s mostly number from the waist down. So the only warning we get is a rapid decrease in alertness and near-paralysis.<br><br>So.<br><br>With all that going on, I can<sq>t tell you how many times I<sq>ve cleaned piss, shit, puss, blood (from her period and from hemorrhoids, which can be a nightmare for a bedridden patient). I<sq>ve cleaned it from both her vagina and backside, from the bed, from my hands, her hands, anything near her, and once from the cat.<br><br>Don<sq>t ask.<br><br>If you had asked me as recent as 3 or 4 years ago if I would be able to handle this, I<sq>d tell you no way. But it comes on gradually, and when I said <dq>In sickness and in health,<dq> I wasn<sq>t fucking around. I learned to deal with it - I don<sq>t always deal the best, and I couldn<sq>t even tell you how many times I was mad at the disease but took it out on her. I<sq>m no saint, and I get so angry - but I also calm down pretty quickly and work hard to make sure she knows I<sq>m mad at the disease, not her.<br><br>I say all that to give you some background so I don<sq>t sound like as big a monster as I feel<colon> No, I don<sq>t find my wife sexually attractive. She knows it and it depresses her greatly, no matter how many times I try to convince her (and myself) that I still do. But my sex drive is practically non-existent these days. While I love porn/bewbs/girls on trampolines as much as anyone, I don<sq>t really get aroused by anything. I still act as if I do and behave as just as big a pervert as I<sq>ve always been, but really, there<sq>s not much going on downtown.<br><br>But do I love her? Absolutely. More than ever. I think of what she<sq>s been through and it destroys me. She<sq>s bedridden at 36. She was in a nursing home twice for a few months at a time (before we did a great deal of home modification to be able to accommodate her). She was told repeatedly she was the youngest person they<sq>ve ever had at the home! The staff was just trying to be funny, but they had no idea how badly this devastated her. During her second stay, her roommate (a wonderfully kind and pleasant old woman) died LOUDLY in the middle of the night - because it was so late nobody was coming to pick up the body. She had to stay in that room for hours while they tried to find somewhere to put her or the body, I don<sq>t remember which.<br><br>I would give her any/everything I could. But I can<sq>t seem to manage the ol<sq> 4 inches of manliness that I used to be able to give her... (sorry, had to put in a joke there, it was getting too dark).<br><br>Fuck MS.<br><br></p>",

I graduated a year ago and since then, I<sq>ve more or less come out of my shell.  <br>I used to be terrified of walking up to a girl I didn<sq>t know and just talking to her. I would always see a girl smile at me, or laugh at something I said, and I would get a nervous heart rate into the triple digits when I tried to volley some banter with her to make her laugh again.  <br>And then I<sq>d retreat into my hermit shell and jerk off to the thought of her later.  <br>And then one day I saw a cute girl at a cafe, she smiled at me, I was sick of being single, somehow we got into a conversation and after going back and forth, I did it. My first pick-up attempt<colon> <dq>Think I can call you some time for a date?<dq>  <br>I didn<sq>t piss my pants, I didn<sq>t shake until my coffee spilled all over my wrist. And you wouldn<sq>t believe it... She totally... Rejected me.  <br>The thing is, it *didn<sq>t* suck. I took it like a man, told her <dq>Well maybe we can be friends?<dq> and she looked surprised and smiled and said, <dq>yeah totally! it<sq>s nothing about you personally, I just have a boyfriend.<dq>  <br>We traded numbers, became friends. Later on her and her boyfriend broke up and then we dated. She *did* think I was attractive, but she was faithful. That<sq>s not guaranteed, but if I took her rejection like a coward and ran away screaming <dq>STUCK UP BITCH!<dq> That never would<sq>ve happened.  <br>After that, I realized that girls give signs when they<sq>re interested in you<colon> and they<sq>re either interested in you romantically or not romantically, but either way, they usually expect you to make a move.  <br>You don<sq>t have to say anything specific, you just have to make some playful talk, tell her who you are and ask her questions and then say <dq>hey do you think we can hang out some time?<dq>  <br>Now I<sq>m not afraid to make a move at all. Most of my fears and concerns are when I<sq>m actually *in* a relationship.  <br>As far as this vs dating sites and stuff like that<colon>  <br>I<sq>ll say this. Meeting a girl naturally definitely feels DIFFERENT. When you<sq>re online, you<sq>re a little more selective. When you see someone in person, they have a chance and you have a chance to show each other your personality, your fragrance, your voice, how you carry yourself, body language, physical presence.  <br>Those things definitely make a difference and there<sq>s girls I have approached in real life that I think one of us would not have swiped the other right if it were on Tinder.  <br>Here<sq>s some tips though<colon>  <br>1) If it<sq>s raining and you see a cute girl hiding under an awning, offer to walk her with your umbrella. (I met an ex like this)  <br>2) If a girl smiles at you, do a slight wave gesture with a smile and see if she reciprocates. **Alert** - Make sure she<sq>s not smiling to someone behind you. If she reciprocates the greeting, just walk up and say, <dq>Hi I<sq>m **IRAn00b**, nice to meet you.<dq>  <br>3) Don<sq>t attach commitment to the initial request. Don<sq>t say <dq>We should go out some time and get married and have babies.<dq> Instead, phrase it open ended like, <dq>We should hang out some time<dq>. Girls like to make platonic friends as much as they like to meet dudes to date. And they hate that when they meet a cool guy, rejecting him means no friendship. Being a friend after being rejected actually shows girls that you aren<sq>t bothered by rejection and that you<sq>re confident enough to maintain the same level headed coolness that they liked about you. I<sq>ve been friend zoned, but I<sq>ve also dated girls that friend zoned me before. It<sq>s not an expectation that it<sq>ll happen, but the point is, be open minded to friendships.  <br>4) Get off your fucking phone. If you<sq>re staring at Snapchat the whole time you<sq>re walking to your car or sitting in a lobby somewhere, you won<sq>t pay attention to what<sq>s around you.  <br>5) Don<sq>t hit on a girl when she<sq>s at work. You<sq>re putting a lot of pressure on her and she might just be nice to you because she<sq>s in customer service. It<sq>s kind of a douche move to put her on the spot. Instead, drop crumbs to see if she bites to show that she<sq>s not just being nice to you for work. Say things like, <dq>What is there to do in this area? I haven<sq>t been to *ImaginaryVille* before...<dq> and when she makes suggestions, say <dq>Yeah, I wish someone could show me.<dq> If she<sq>s like, <dq>Well ask your friends!<dq> too bad, so sad. But she might just say, <dq>Yeah I can show you!<dq> or something.  <br>But yeah, there<sq>s definitely people in their 20<sq>s that are asking girls out <dq>IRL<dq> lol. It<sq>s not better or worse than any other way, but I definitely think it<sq>s worth doing. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>This is going to be very long, but it<sq>s the most important thing to have ever happened to me.<br><br><br>Before my current SO and I got together, we were best friends. She was my rock, and my everything through a very rough time in my life following a very abusive relationship, which led to me developing a drug abuse problem, depression, and nearly dropping out of school, twice. I loved her and I still loved her, but at that point in my life, I didn<sq>t want to make her any more involved in my problems. She was there for me, and I went to her for support but I didn<sq>t want to make these her problems.<br><br>My entire life was shit at this time. My schedule, my sleep, my health, my weight, my budget, my education. Every aspect was deteriorating. I was spending 12 hours a day in bed, watching nothing but shitty tv and eating crap food. There were days I didn<sq>t leave my house, one time almost a week.<br><br>I really just fell so hard in love, and I knew she would never want me the way I was. I decided that my first step was to start going to therapy, to talk to a professional and figure out where to start. I didn<sq>t want to google or reddit or any of that shit. I started seeing my therapist initially for school concerns. I didn<sq>t know what direction to go in, nor where to start. I wasn<sq>t motivated, I didn<sq>t have any goals. He helped me figure out what it is I wanted to do, and to start creating smaller goals that will get me closer and closer to doing what I wanted to do. I began organizing my life into a journal, breaking down my days, weeks, and months into the tasks that I needed to get done so that I can be a better me. This then led into me creating a sleep schedule along with a proper diet. In creating a sleep schedule and diet, I was effectively cutting out time that I was wasting rather than sleeping, and saving money on not spending or buying delivery food. These both helped my sleep and overall wellness, and I began to feel more alert, and less sluggish. I gave up smoking weed for a while too. I still smoke quite often now as pain relief from multiple sports injuries, but it do it after work, or as a reward from a long day; always when I don<sq>t have an obligation. I previously was waking up, getting high, and getting nothing done.<br><br>I picked up a job, nothing big, but something to help me pay rent because I no longer had any scholarship money saved up, and my parents can<sq>t afford to support me financially. Getting a job gave me money, and gave me a concrete block in my schedule. I now had an obligation that required me to be at my best to perform. No more sleeping in, no more getting high. I now had expectations that had to be met. In doing so, I was able to save up enough money to move out of the drug-enabling co-op I was in, into my own place in a house with some good people. <br><br>I also got my emotions in check, which I believe is the more integral part of all of this. I took grasp of all external factors in my life<colon> my education, my income, my housing, and my health, but I had to work on what was going in *inside* me. I learned to let go. I began practicing meditation and mindfulness. This brought so much clarity into my life. With all the negative bullshit that was going on in my life, I was able to no longer repress it. I could peacefully look at what was going on, and just let go. I stopped hating my abusive ex. I stopped hating myself for what I had become. I stopped feeling depressed, feeling paranoid of being hated by my parents for where I was with my life, I stopped worrying. I began living in the now, in the present moment. Every day was a new day, and I started seeing it like that. I took every challenge, every obstacle from this point on one step at a time, and I<sq>ve never felt so relieved. It was as if the weight of the world was lifted from my shoulders. I could breathe. I could think. And although it wasn<sq>t an overnight change, it was gradual, and I kept getting better and better. I<sq>m still currently working on becoming even better, but I<sq>ve made so much more progress than I ever have in my entire life. <br><br>I did this over the course of a year, and she was there for me. I honestly did what I could to keep these problems from falling onto her, but we grew closer and closer as I got through this. I eventually let her know that I was doing therapy, I opened up about what was going on in my head, and the worries that I had, and the things that I felt. I told her about my accomplishments in my life, and she praised and supported me. I was doing this for both her and I. She saw growth in me. I became strong, and I got my shit together. I was out of my crap environment that I was previously in. I was making money. I was doing better in school. I grabbed my life by the fucking horns and took control, and it<sq>s been that way ever since. I found what it was I wanted to do with my life, I<sq>ve been making progress in my field, and today actually, I just got accepted into my first internship. I<sq>m excelling as a person, I feel more alert and more aware, and much much more healthy. I<sq>ve been doing yoga, I<sq>ve been eating primarily vegan, and I<sq>ve lost a ton of body fat. I<sq>m no longer overweight, and I now have an attractive athletic physique. I<sq>m proud to say that I got my shit together. My life, since I decided to make this change, has felt like I<sq>m driving down a road, and catching green lights all the way down. And I<sq>m going to make sure it never stops.<br><br>One day, towards the end of that summer, we went on a walk as friends, and came back as a couple. She<sq>s been my world ever since. I hope that one day I<sq>m lucky enough to call her my wife. She is my absolute everything, and I don<sq>t know what I would do without her love and support. I<sq>m very thankful to share my life with her. She<sq>s amazing, and I still get butterflies every time I see her. <br><br>I continue to do the same thing that I did when I started<colon> every night before bed, I write out the next day in my little black notebook, broken down by the hour and then tasks, and I stick to it. It<sq>s what keeps me together. I feel a sense of gratification every time I cross off something from the list. It means I<sq>m staying on track and getting my things done, one by one. Each small goal builds up to the next bigger goal. That<sq>s how I see life. I break down the big, final goal, into smaller, more obtainable ones, and take everything one step at a time.<br><br>____________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>EDIT<colon> WOW, I didn<sq>t think I was going to get this sort of response!

                "answer": "<p>**tl;dr** - Make her important, eat pussy, work out, get her back, take <dq>me time<dq>, kiss her like you mean it.<br><br>35-year-old man here, which is basically retirement age by Reddit standards. I<sq>ll throw in some advice from my end of the pool, more because I grew up without much in the way of male role models, and all this was shit I had to learn the oh-so-fucking-hard way. My spouse and I have been together almost a decade now, through some intense Lifetime movie of the week shit, and we<sq>re still swingin<sq>. I owe a lot of that to her; I like to think of myself like some more handsome Confuscious the older I get, but the truth is, we would have never gotten to where we are now, with me armed with the tiny bits of wisdom I<sq>ve summoned, if not for her infinite fucking patience. So, I suppose, my first bit of advice would be to get lucky and hook a good one, who<sq>s willing to put up with your bullshit while you grow up and learn to be a man.<br><br>She is important. I originally wrote, <dq>make her feel important<dq>. Then, I changed it to, <dq>make her important<dq>. I think that statement, though, best guides you on the course of action you need to take <colon> she is important. When you come home and she is telling you about your day, get off your fucking phone, stop staring at the computer screen, put down what you<sq>re doing and *listen* to her. Make sure she is acutely aware that for as long as she is talking to you, she is the only thing in your universe - look her in the eye, nod along, ask follow-up questions. If it<sq>s date night, leave the phone at home. Don<sq>t interrupt her when she<sq>s talking. Do things for her that require effort. Sometimes, relationships get to be this zero sum game where you<sq>re putting points up on the board, and in those situations, we go for the easy shit. How much effort, really and truly, did it take you to buy a bouquet of flowers at Trader Joe<sq>s while you were there anyhow buying spaghetti sauce for dinner? Not saying don<sq>t buy flowers, but when you spend your Saturday sweating through your clothes doing something just for her, I<sq>ve never met a decent woman alive that didn<sq>t see you doing it and appreciate the work. So many of my friends treat their spouses like after-thoughts. Even after years, you have to find ways, every day, to say to her, <dq>You are important to me.<dq> That<sq>s one I<sq>ve discovered recently, and I wish I had learned it early, because it<sq>s paid dividends out the ass since I started making it a focus.<br><br>Second, eat pussy. I<sq>m not gonna<sq> tart the words up with flowery speech, you<sq>re a grown ass man. Eat pussy and love it. Get good at it. Make that something you actively pursue. Make it a fucking hobby, make it something you<sq>d tell your friends if they wanted a bunch of too much information, <dq>Oh, yeah, I<sq>ve really been practicing my pussy licking technique lately.<dq> Oh, and when I say <dq>eat pussy<dq>, I mean you get your face down there and you help your woman get off, and you stay down there until she does. I don<sq>t care if your jaw hurts, if your fingers hurt. Some nights, when you get good, she<sq>ll pop off like fourth of July the moment your mouth goes south, some nights will take some good, ole<sq> fashioned elbow grease. Why? Because it may get bad at times, and it probably will, but even in the worst times, even if a woman has her bags packed staring at the door out of your house, she<sq>s gonna<sq> think twice walking out the door on a dude that gives good head. Plus, y<sq>know, stop being so selfish, ya<sq> prick.<br><br>Third, maintain the packaging. Don<sq>t be that dude, like every other dude, and get fat after you get settled. Get jacked. Hit the weights. Stop eating so much pizza, fatass. She<sq>s your wife, you may be the only dick she ever gets the rest of her life, she may be crazy enough to have you be the only dick she *wants* for the rest of her life. Don<sq>t you want to give her a trophy husband? <br><br>Fourth, her corner is your corner. Period. Even if she<sq>s batshit crazy wrong, and she will be. Give her your input, try and give her your advice, but there will come days that no matter what you say, she<sq>s going to put the car towards the edge of the cliff and drive that sumbitch right off. When those days come, you buckle your seat belt, you reach out to take her hand, and you go for the ride. She needs to know she can rely on you, not just trust you. Trust is a rare thing, but knowing someone will be there when you need them, that you can *depend* on them? That in your darkest hour, they will be a light that does not go out? That is priceless and precious, truly. When those metaphorical chips are down, no matter what, you have her back, or you<sq>re going to sow the seeds for a doubt that could undo you down the road.<br><br>Fifth, make sure you get plenty of time apart, time for yourself. Schedule Guys Nights. Take up hobbies and stay active in them. You are a person, not some fucked-up siamese twin. For your sanity, to quell resentment and impatience, to soothe irritations, just get the fuck away from each other sometimes. <br><br>Last, never kiss her half-assed. I think <dq>don<sq>t do anything half-assed<dq> is some grade A solid wisdom, but if you<sq>re gonna<sq> half-ass something, kissing your wife is the dead rock bottom of that list. If you<sq>re gonna<sq> kiss her, do it right, with all of you, with your hands and your arms. Do it like you fuckin<sq> mean it, every single time, not for the sake of anything else save the simple fact that a kiss between you and your wife is the simplest way to say you love her, and you refuse to love her lazy.<br><br>I think those are some good ones. Give <sq>em hell, kid.<br><br></p>",

It was byob so i brought a cooler as I **knew** I was gonna need to be super drunk for this. Anyway, we grab lunch before heading to the cruise since I was hungry. She<sq>s making a few semi-sexual comments every now and again etc etc. (oh boy here we go) We head to the cruise, its actually pretty fun, lots of drinking, dancing, singing. About halfway through the cruise (she<sq>s a lightweight so she<sq>s fairly drunk by now) she kisses me. I mean, Im not going to pretend like I resisted.... because I didnt. The first time we kissed since we broke up 5months ago. All i could think was <dq>ah fuck, here I go with the feelings again<dq>. <br><br>Anyway, cruise ends and she asks whats the plan now.

Sometimes I feel guilty because if I would have just ignored her, it never would have happened <colon>/<br><br>Late into the night, I felt my body pretty much say <dq>it is time to go home.<dq>  I wanted to get in bed before the spins or anything like that.  A few of us seniors lived in an annex house just down the road, so I said my goodbyes and headed home.  As I<sq>m leaving, this girl decides that she wants to walk me home.  I wasn<sq>t going to hook up with her no matter how drunk I was, so I just viewed it as company to walk home with.  I was much stronger than her, so even in nightmare land where a girl would actually try to hurt me, I knew I would win.<br><br>We get to the annex, and I<sq>m pretty much blacked out at this point.  Alcohol takes a long time to get into my system, so it can take a while before I feel the effects.  Cleary I had drunk more than I wanted.  I don<sq>t know how she convinced her way into the annex, or how she got into my room (we had single rooms in the house).  I think I remember her say something like <dq>I just want to make sure you get into bed.<dq>  So in my drunken stupor, I guess I took off some of my clothes, climbed into bed, and passed out... or so I thought. <br><br> Frankly I don<sq>t remember a whole lot, and for a long time I think I tried to convince myself that it was just a really terrible dream.  I only remember bits and pieces, and I wouldn<sq>t be surprised if I was asleep for most of it.  Basically, she climbed into bed and had sex with me.  I remember saying once or twice <dq>fuck off, I<sq>m trying to sleep,<dq> but that is pretty much all of it.  She was a heavyset girl and I was half asleep, so I don<sq>t know if I could have pushed her off, or if I even tried.<br><br>I woke up the next morning and slowly connected what had happened.  For a few days I tried to pretend to myself that it was a really bad dream, but over the years I<sq>ve accepted the fact that it had really happened.  I can<sq>t remember if she had put a condom on, or if I even finished.  I was terrified that she had gotten pregnant, or I had caught some disease.  I got an STD check, and luckily, I was clean.  I think I saw her once around campus after that, but she certainly never came back around to our house.  I had assumed she was with one of the sororities or something, but I never saw her with them when the packs of them would come around.<br><br>How did it affect my life?  Well, I have a harder time trusting women.  Part of this was a holdover from what happened to me in HS, but this event certainly didn<sq>t help.  On first dates I don<sq>t really drink much, if at all.  Maybe 2-3 beers for the entire night.  I<sq>m sure I seem boring to the girls I<sq>m going out with at the start, but frankly I don<sq>t want to be vulnerable like that ever again.  I<sq>ll let loose later on once I trust her (not super drunk or anything, I still keep it classy).  I also don<sq>t sleep with girls who have had more than a couple drinks.  Even the slightest sign they are buzzed, and it isn<sq>t going to happen.  I know for a fact I have missed out on a lot of sex because of this, but frankly the fear of putting someone else in the same position I was in terrifies me.  I haven<sq>t had a one-night stand or a long-term GF since then (over 5 years now).  I go out on dates, but nothing serious.  I do get really lonely sometimes, but I have a great group of friends which kinda makes up for it.  I never told any of my friends or family, and I pretty much just keep it to myself.  Frankly, no one seems to care if this happens to a guy.  It was also really emasculating<colon> me, a man, was raped by a girl?  I still don<sq>t know why I didn<sq>t fight her off or anything, but I think that goes back the whole <dq>this is a bad dream<dq> aspect.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The many double standards and false information, probably. Plenty of issues to choose from.<br><br>- The fact that boys are doing MUCH worse in education than girls with UK universities warning being born male will be (is already) a social disadvantage. Boys and young men drop out far more due to the feminized educational system, and barely 40<percent> of the university population are male. Apparantly the lack of women in STEM deserves more attention though ...<br><br>- The fact that men are twice as likely as a woman to get convicted for the same crime, and that if given a prison sentence, men serve 60<percent> longer prison sentences, again ... for the same crime.<br><br>- The way men and boys are automatically viewed with suspicion in society. It hurts to not be able to interact with children without some women immediately pulling their children away out of fear I<sq>ll fuck it then and there. When I was a kid, I remember many pleasant interactions with grown ups. And not once was I abused. The media is probably to blame for this. I also notice that when I walk behind a woman at night, I<sq>ll slow down or cross the road to not make her feel uncomfortable, or make myself feel guilty or like a potential criminal for doing so. I shouldn<sq>t have to do that.<br><br>- This ties in with the one above; the lack of male teachers in education. When I was young, almost half the faculty was male. Now, it seems to increasingly be a rarity. Having known former male teachers, something you<sq>ll often hear is that they felt the workplace was becoming increasingly hostile towards them. With female teachers and parents looking at them funny and moderating their behavior and speech. Young children need both male and female role models. Also, studies have shown that female teachers (statistically) will give boys lower test scores for the same results as girls. (on anonymous tests, they scored pretty much the same) Which illustrates their bias and how that among other behavior might cause boys to lose interest in education.<br><br>- The fact that men are almost exclusively seen as responsible for domestic violence, dispite it being well known by now (especially since that Harvard study) that over 24<percent> of relationships have DV, half of which is recipricol, the other half has one violent partner. And in 70<percent> of those cases, the violent partner is the woman. Women are also far more likely to repeat abusive behavior. Why is this not discussed? Why do nearly all pictures of DV campaigns show battered women? Sure, men are stronger and bigger, but that has nothing to do with it. It<sq>s another double standard that needs to go. DV is DV.<br><br>- Men represent over 96<percent> of societies workplace fatalities and serious injuries, because we are expected to do the most dangerous and unpleasant jobs, which often also pay quite well. There<sq>s always talk of a glass ceiling, but what about the glass basement? Why do feminists exclusively talk about the minority of men at the top of the ladder, ignoring the vast majority of the men at the bottom, that built and maintain society? Where are all the female quota<sq>s in the fishing industry? Plumbing? Roofing? Mining? Garbage collecting? Sewage work? Construction work? Etc etc ... The typical answer you<sq>ll get is some nonsense about patriarchy and women not feeling safe, but I<sq>ve known a few women who have done <dq>male jobs<dq> and done them bloody well. If a woman wants to do a job like that, they can. The fact that there<sq>s so little push for equality in those sectors is nothing short of hypocrisy.<br><br>- Men are vastly over represented in homeless and suicide statistics, and yet the vast majority of support is offered to women. Again, mostly because women<sq>s organisations get far more funding.<br><br>- The bias in favor of women in family courts. And the lack of ability for men to opt out of parenthood the same way women can. (although Finland I believe is currently discussing parental/financial abortion for men if a woman on her own decides to keep a child they didn<sq>t agree on, which makes sense to me)<br><br>- The disparity in funding for men<sq>s mental health and cancer compared to women<sq>s.<br><br>Plenty more where those came from, but let<sq>s face it, noone really cares unless they are men<sq>s issues that also affect women...<br><br>Personally I think it<sq>s time to get rid of <dq>men<sq>s issues<dq> and <dq>women<sq>s issues<dq>, and simply talk about them as societal issues. No more fighting for funding (which always goes to women<sq>s organisations anyway) and simply treating each issue on it<sq>s own merrit. I<sq>m so sick of this comparing all the time, although at the same time when it comes to men<sq>s issues, I feel it<sq>s important to raise awareness and to highlight the feminist hypocrisy, because of all the damage they<sq>ve done. And yes, I do blame feminists for a lot of the misinformation, ridicule, and lack of attention for male issues, because they have claimed the only place in society to talk about gender issues, but havn<sq>t done so for men because it doesn<sq>t fit their ideological narrative. And not only that, but they actively disrupt events where men<sq>s issues are discussed, ban them from speaking, and silence them any way they can.<br><br>I<sq>m not an MRA, but I have pretty much become an anti-feminist in recent years, the more I learned about these issues and interacted with feminists. I<sq>m simply an egalitarian who thinks it<sq>s clear that if you put all western men and women<sq>s issues next to each other, men clearly get the short end of the stick. And yet women still keep patting themselves on the back telling themselves that they are the only victims, as if all men are floating around on clouds. As if it<sq>s a zero sum game. As if looking at all the facts and acknowledging them would somehow take away from genuine women<sq>s issues getting attention. Their precious narrative is clearly more important than male lives, which to me is unacceptable.<br><br>\u201cMen\u2019s greatest weakness is their facade of strength, and women\u2019s greatest strength is their facade of weakness.\u201d \u2015 Warren Farrell, The Myth of Male Power</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As someone who<sq>s been depressed and considered suicide multiple times for multiple reasons, depression for me wasn<sq>t being sad all the time, it was feeling nothing all the time. It was underachieving my way through class, not giving a fuck about my parents, friends, teachers, or whatever. It was being stuck in my own mind all the time, feeling like I had nothing left to live for. And more than a few times I set an <sq>expiration date<sq> for myself, when I<sq>d finally get the courage to do it. But of course, things would pick up and I<sq>d forget about suicide and eventually things got better. <br><br><br>I think a lot of it stems from being so dissatisfied with your life that you just don<sq>t want to deal with things anymore. When I was getting bullied, I<sq>d think, <dq>If I<sq>d just slit my wrists I wouldn<sq>t have to deal with any of this anymore, forever.<dq> And later in high school when I felt dead inside, I<sq>d just think about my death all the time, even romanticize it. I just wished somebody else would do it, like stab me or shoot me or run me over so my parents wouldn<sq>t see me as some sort of fucked up failure of a kid with mental illness. I<sq>d wish that someone would crash into me or that the building would collapse so I could die a normal death like everyone else, but also just not deal with life. I hated who I was and my shortcomings in life.<br><br><br>I still feel kind of empty inside. It doesn<sq>t matter how happy you make others or how many people love you. It doesn<sq>t matter if you are the richest person in the world. Depression can affect anyone in any position. To say otherwise would be like saying a kid who didn<sq>t get as many Christmas presents as his friend can<sq>t possibly have had an enjoyable Christmas.<br><br><br>Sorry about your son, man. It sucks to say it but there<sq>s nothing anyone could have done, these things are hard to catch and there<sq>s such a stigma around depression and mental illness that if anything ever comes out its social and vocational suicide. </p>",

You don<sq>t have time for most of the preparation conversations I mentioned, but it<sq>s still worth trying to make them happen if you can.  Brokerages will be closed, but parents/friends<sq> parents might be around, and a men<sq>s apparel store like the Men<sq>s Wearhouse are open until 9pm.<br><br>It<sq>s okay to be a little nervous.  But don<sq>t be really nervous.  You see, you<sq>ve been given an amazing opportunity here, but also one that makes perfect sense, given your request.  Here<sq>s the biggest lesson to be learned here<colon> you<sq>ll never know what<sq>s possible until you try, and you never know what people are willing to do for you until you ask.  As a student, this is even more true.<br><br><br>**What to wear**<br><br>Wear something professional.  It doesn<sq>t have to be a suit and tie, but it also doesn<sq>t hurt.  Nice shoes, a belt that matches them, slacks and a button-down shirt.  Add a tie if you have one that looks nice.  With all due respect to /u/Zelotic, if a suit that isn<sq>t tailored but still looks reasonably nice on you is what you have, wear that.  But what I described will suffice.  You<sq>re a student, not a business professional.  They<sq>ll understand.  Who you are and how you compose yourself is more important.<br><br>**How to prepare**<br><br>As /u/humdinger71 said, prepare your questions ahead of time.  Preparing is more than just making a list.  Research the company and the people you<sq>re expecting to see/meet.  Learn their positions on the things you<sq>ll be asking them.  Their answers will mean more if you understand what their background is and where they<sq>re coming from.<br><br>Run your questions by your instructor before the meeting if at all possible.  This has two benefits<colon> 1, you<sq>ll get important feedback about them, and 2, your instructor will probably be impressed with your level of preparation, possibly having a positive impact on your grade.  If your instructor is unavailable (after class, check their office hours, etc.), ask someone else who<sq>s opinion you trust.  Consider asking a parent or relative who knows about this company<sq>s area of business (or about business in general), a friend<sq>s successful parent, or just walk into the bank where you have your account and ask to speak with the branch manager for 20 minutes about something unrelated to bank business, but something about which you were hoping to get his opinion.  Alternatively, you could walk into an investment or insurance brokerage - they know a lot about sizing people up and brokerages are all about good first impressions without knowing anything about who<sq>s walking in the door.  Remember<colon> you<sq>re a student.  People sometimes say yes to the most amazing things.  <colon>-)<br><br>Another benefit to brokerages is that, in the same vein about first impressions, they<sq>re big on handshakes and interaction. Walk one and watch how they move to greet you.  Watch their face and their smile.  Feel how firm their handshake is.  And if you don<sq>t have a brokerage, just walk into a men<sq>s professional apparel store in the morning with some donuts for the folks working there and ask them to teach you how to shake hands professionally.  Most of the same behaviors will be present there as well.<br><br>With all of this, you just gained a bunch of knowledge, and have effectively interviewed at 2-3 places you might want to get a job at some day in the future.  (You just showed them some of the extent to which you are willing to prepare for a simple class assignment.  That<sq>s some go-getter behavior, there!)<br><br>Memorize your questions as much as possible so that your list of them is more of a cue card or reminder than something you have to read from.  Repeat them to yourself over and over.  But don<sq>t be afraid to read them if you<sq>re having trouble; it<sq>s just a little bit more polished if you don<sq>t have to read from a list.<br><br>Consider printing some business cards before you go.  If you have a home printer, you can get some [inexpensive ($13) business card templates](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Avery-Two-Side-Printable-Business-08871/dp/B00006IBV7/) that will work with any inkjet printer and will snap off into clean-edge (not perforated) cards you can carry with you.  Bring 30-40 of them and keep them in your jacket pocket for easy access.  You can find [basic templates for Microsoft Word](http<colon>//www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Search/_/siteschannels-templates-software/?msearch=true&Ntx=mode+matchall&Ntk=All&Nr=AND<percent>28SITESCHANNELS<percent>3AAvery.com<percent>29&N=4294967207&dimsearch=true&Ntt=08871) (make sure they<sq>re compatible with the Avery product number) or simply use [Avery<sq>s online design tool](http<colon>//dpo.print.avery.com/dpo7/app/US_en/dpo.jsp?sku=8871).  Whatever design you choose, keep it simple - just text, no fancy design elements.  Your goal is to get your information out there, not wow them with your fancy design skills, which might actually turn them off.  More on this later.<br><br>One final bit of preparation is to reach out to your contact at the company in question and ask them when would be an appropriate time to ask your questions.  Make it clear that you don<sq>t want to interrupt or interfere with the meeting, and so you want to know ahead of time when you should speak up, and when you should just watch.  Ask if they have a meeting agenda that they can send you beforehand so that you can prepare accordingly.<br><br>**How to act**<br><br>Leave with 2-3 times the amount of time you think you<sq>ll need to get there, and when doing this, plan to arrive an hour before you<sq>re due.  Yes, an hour.  Don<sq>t walk in - find yourself a local cafe or park bench to sit at and re-familiarize yourself with your questions.  Don<sq>t get any food or drink that can spill on or stain your clothes.  Drink water.  If you spill it, it evaporates.  Bring a safe snack like a granola bar or hard candy so your blood sugar isn<sq>t low, which can lead to a nervous feeling.  If they spill, they<sq>re just dry crumbs.  When it<sq>s time for the meeting, walk in the door 15-20 minutes before the meeting is scheduled to start.  That<sq>s a reasonable time to wait in a lobby, but not so long that it<sq>s awkward.  It<sq>s possible that you<sq>ll be invited in early to meet people and/or network, and this amount of time allows for that.  If you<sq>re just waiting in a lobby, that<sq>s fine too.  Continue to read over your questions.<br><br>Now that you know how to handshake (and hopefully when to stand and put that knowledge into practice), do so.  Don<sq>t be too forward. (Don<sq>t stand up and shake everyone<sq>s hand who walks in the door; just those to whom you are introduced and/or who are made aware of your presence when they come in.)  However strong the professionals you learned from shook hands, shake slightly softer than that.  You don<sq>t need to assert dominance (as many of them do, sometimes); you simply need to avoid feeling like a limp noodle.<br><br>Sit quietly when meeting business is going on, and don<sq>t speak up with questions unless they explicitly tell you to do so.  Even then, limit your questions to the most important ones.  Consider taking notes when it<sq>s appropriate, especially about subjects relevant to your questions, so that you have the opportunity to modify your questions and/or better understand the answers in context when they are given.<br><br>Thank everyone for their time and for allowing you to sit in on the meeting, both at the beginning and at the end.  If there is any schmoozing time (meeting and greeting, multiple casual conversations going on simultaneously, etc.), consider handing out your shiny new business card to the people to whom you are introduced.  Politicians, board members, executives, etc.  This will make a good first impression and may well lead to an invitation to interview later, or perhaps a positive memory if anyone ever asks them what they think of you.  If not, they will at least hopefully remember who you are if you ever decide to apply somewhere they are.  Note<colon> having or handing out a business card isn<sq>t necessary for what you<sq>re doing; it is just something that can be a nice touch.  Don<sq>t go overboard and hand it out to everyone you meet or drop it on the table in front of everyone.  Hand it out only to those who ask for it, or with whom you<sq>ve made a nice connection and might want to speak with in the future.  (Assuming they look or sound open to that.)  Remember<colon> you<sq>re not there to network; you<sq>re there for a class assignment.  But you can *also* do a *little* networking if you feel it<sq>s appropriate.  There<sq>s nothing wrong with just skipping that, however.<br><br>**How to ask questions**<br><br>Whenever it<sq>s time to ask your questions, try to have them already in your mind.  This is why you tried to memorize them and then re-familiarized yourself with them when you arrived.  Again, don<sq>t be afraid to look at your list if you have to.<br><br>Keep your questions short and to the point, as much as is possible.  Try to avoid background statements and just ask the question itself unless this isn<sq>t possible.  (Example<colon> don<sq>t refer to something someone said or did in the past if you can just ask them about what they<sq>re going to do in the future, etc.)  This can add unnecessary length to your questions and can sometimes add emotional content that doesn<sq>t need to be there.<br><br>Write down their answers, but don<sq>t make them wait while you do.  Use shorthand or referential notes if you need must, but don<sq>t make a room full of people wait for you to write down what they said.  If there are 15 people in the room and they end up waiting 15 seconds after each answer for you to write times a total of 12 questions, you just cost the company 45 minutes so they could wait around for you to write.  Yes, businesspeople sometimes think in those terms.  Be quick about this.<br><br>Thank each person who answers your questions for doing so after they have, each time.  If more than one person chimes in for a question, thank each one of them.  Just a simple <dq>Thank you.<dq> or <dq>Thank you, Mr. BigWig.<dq> will do.</p>",

We were chatting and sex stuff came up and some how the topic of being curious about what it was like to suck a dick came up. We both expressed equal curiosity about it and next thing we knew we were both getting aroused. We decided to give it a go with each other for a few mins each. Neither of us finished, and when we were done we took care of ourselves real quick and that was that. We both acknowledged it wasn<sq>t terrible but really didn<sq>t do anything for either of us and confirmed our sexuality. We have never spoken of it again and are still great friends to this day. <br><br>Fast forward about two years after this happened and I ended up confessing the story to another one of my good friends who is also friends with my other buddy. Well he ends up confessing that he has had many of the same curiosities about himself but never an opportunity to find out if it<sq>s something he was truly into. He ends up convincing me to let him go down on me to see if he likes it and we did basically the same thing I did before - 5 mins each, no finish and then threw on a porn and finished ourselves real quick when we were done. He appreciated that he was able to confirm it wasn<sq>t for him either and although he moved across the country for his now wife we<sq>ve still remained friends as well. <br><br>I don<sq>t feel any sexual attraction to guys much but guys aren<sq>t repulsive to me either. My wife and I have been together almost 10 yrs, married 2.5 and are now looking into swinging. She knows all about my history and has asked if I would like to do anything with any guys if the opportunity arose, and while I don<sq>t find myself with any desire to do any of that again, I<sq>m still not afraid to touch a guys dick but I don<sq>t really see myself doing that any more. <br><br>Edit<colon> my first gold!

                "answer": "<p>Once in college. She had a dick.<br><br>edit<colon> I have been getting PMs and some replies asking for the story. Here it is.<br><br>My junior year of college I was at a house party with mostly friends or acquaintances. It was a typical college party, but pretty much everyone knew each other. I was/am in no way a <dq>pick up artist<dq> kind of person. Sometimes I would hook up, but it was never priority #1. I just wanted to have fun, good company, and be a stupid college kid. <br><br>She had come to the party with one of my friends. I<sq>m pretty outgoing and friendly, so I think she felt comfortable with me in conversation. We talked for some time as a group, and then went outside due to the temperature in the house. We ended up having a lot in common. Similar backgrounds, etc. We spent a lot of time just talking. It was really nice. <br><br>As far as appearances, I was 100<percent> convinced I was talking to someone who was born with a female body. I didn<sq>t even think about it. Features that are tells when someone is transitioning from one gender to another were very feminine. <br><br>Anyway, we ended up really hitting it off. We didn<sq>t do anything more than hold hands or have arms around each other outside. She had mentioned that she left her hoodie upstairs, but couldn<sq>t remember which room. There were a ton of people at the party, so several rooms had piles of hoodies/jackets. She asked if I would go upstairs with her and help find it. I figured she might be hinting and hooking up, but if not, I was happy to help her find her hoodie.<br><br>As I thought, she gave up pretty quickly, and kissed me. Everything felt congruent with all my other experiences. I wouldn<sq>t consider myself a beta, but I tried to be respectful in these types of situations. I did notice that times I would try to signal that I would like to fondle her zones, she pulled away slightly. I didn<sq>t think anything of it, just that she wasn<sq>t comfortable with that yet - no big deal. <br><br>After about 10 minutes or so of making out, she pulled away and got really quiet. I remember saying something like <dq>Hey, if you want to get your hoodie and head back downstairs, that<sq>s cool.<dq> She said she wanted to keep going, but she wanted to show me something first. I was down for some sight-seeing.<br><br>That<sq>s when she pulled her skirt down, and I saw the sights.<br><br>I had a lot of mixed feelings. I wasn<sq>t upset with her, but I was definitely surprised and wasn<sq>t sure how to sort it out in my head. After about 15 seconds or so of silence, I remember saying, <dq>I think we found your hoodie!<dq> <br><br>We talked for a long time... about her transition, about what had happened that night. She asked me repeatedly if I was upset or angry. I told her that I was neither, just that it was a new experience that I had just had, and I<sq>m trying to wrap my head around it. While for me this was a deal-breaker for a physical, romantic relationship - I told her I really enjoyed her company and was very glad that we met. <br><br>That was about 15 years ago, and we<sq>re still friends today! She ended up outgrowing her hoodie about 10 years ago, and ended up marrying a man 3 years ago. Went to the wedding with my wife and kids. Really cool person.<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>One of the benefits is being able to stand or kneel which can be easier on the back. But there are other benefits as well. <br><br>First, you have the visual aspect of it. Men are visual and we like to look. A woman is like a moving piece of art and all the curves are pleasing to a mans eye. A woman<sq>s ass is one man<sq>s favorite things to look upon, and when she is in that position it makes her round ass look even rounder and more curvy. Once you get pass the ass, you have your lovers long back exposed to you, which can be quite beautiful to look upon. A woman<sq>s back can be extremely sexy and when she has long hair that cascades over her back...it is an amazing sight to see. And then there are those alluring shoulders that, in that position, are rounded over, creating another curve on that alluring piece of art. When a woman looks over her shoulder in this position and her eyes meet yours...the primal urges are sent into overdrive.<br><br>And then there are the legs...When you approach a woman from behind, she is very exposed. If she points her toes, which is easy to do in this position, it makes her calves more defined and makes her legs look long and slender. And then you can see the backs and inner sides of her thighs. This is what a man cannot see on a daily basis so it is the treasure that we all seek to find and now our eyes can take it in and enjoy every inch. Finally our eyes come to the biggest gift that a woman can give us. We have her soft, warm, soft pussy fully exposed to us. It is exactly where we want to be twenty-four hours a day and unfortunately can only be in a few minutes a day, a few times a week, IF one is lucky. It is a woman<sq>s most precious secret (unless you go on /r/gonewild) and now we finally get to see it. If a woman is wet, and her creamy juices can be seen emanating from her hot pussy, it can be the most erotic view in the world. Once we slide our hard, hot flesh into her and she engulfs us and she coats our hot skin with those creamy juices it is erotic to literally *see* how turned on she really is. Sliding out of a woman and having your hard cock glisten with her juices is an ego boost and at that moment you really feel more manly than any other time of the day.<br><br>The position can also one of dominance and control. She is on her hands and knees, completely in a position of submission. This is in no way degrades her as she is *allowing* you to take her and have your way with her. Digging your fingers into her waist and gripping tightly while you thrust forward and at the same time pulling her back against you allows you to control how quickly or slowly she slides over your rock hard cock. You are in control and usually this allows you to start off slowly, but because of the entirety of the moment, we quickly become primal. Eventually we are are no longer holding, but gripping. We no longer caress, we grasp. We no longer slide, we thrust. We no longer touch, we grab. Being able to penetrate her deep, hard, and fast is a glorious feeling for both. <br><br>The ego is also stroked when we are taking a woman from behind and we are in such a position that the most sensitive area of the tip of our throbbing cock is *not* in direct contact with your hot, silky flesh, enabling us to last longer and pound you from behind with such vigor that your sexy arms can no longer hold you up, and you collapse on the bed with your hair all over your face, lost in a world of euphoria and lust. <br><br>There are so many options for your hands when you are taking a woman from behind. As I mentioned you can grip her hips tightly, or put your hands on her shoulders and pull her back as you thrust harder and harder into her or you can slowly drag your fingers over her back and sides.  You can gather her long, beautiful hair into your hand and pull her hair tightly to pull her head back or turn her head to give her a kiss if you so desire. You can wrap your fingers around her throat (for those of you that like that), or reach around and softly cup one of her supple breasts as her nipple rubs back and forth across your palm or squeeze her breast tightly. Or maybe you grab both of her arms and thrust in hard, making her entire upper body bounce with every thrust, you both hoping that you don<sq>t slip out of her her as your ram her over and over again. <br><br>From this position you can also spank her delicious ass, allowing the red marks to further inspire the primal urges within. Feeling her soaking wet pussy clamp down around you with every spank is more than enough motivation to spank her again. And let<sq>s not forget that we can reach around and tease her swollen clit as we slide in and out of her, as we do our best to send her over the edge into orgasmic bliss, as there is nothing better than cumming with our lover. <br><br>And then there is the sound. The distinct sound and rhythm of a man and woman colliding together as he slams his hard rod into her wet, aching pussy is one of the best sounds in the world. When you mix that sound with a woman<sq>s moans, it is no wonder that a man can only last but a few minutes. The erotic sounds are sometimes too much, causing us to thrust harder and faster until we thrust in as deep as possible and cum deep, deep inside her. <br><br>It can be a position that is both primal or sensual, tender or rough, nasty or loving. It can allow for a quick fuck when she hikes her skirt and you bend her over a piece of furniture as you look for possible voyeurs looking in your direction, or it can be the crescendo of a night of love making and you are so exhausted and sweaty that you just need him to take you hard and fast from behind so you can both end the night with a perfectly synced orgasm. <br><br>**TL;DR** - I can<sq>t get up from my desk.<br><br>**Edit - Woah! I wrote a comment and closed the laptop. Woke up to BestOf AND reddit gold? You<sq>re all amazing! Thank you so much! Aaaand the Inbox blew up.

Except for one person--my best friend. <br><br>I remember the moments after the rape. And feeling this overwhelming fear of hurting my loved ones by telling them. I knew they would also suffer. For 3 days after the attack not a single person touched me. I was mostly at my parents around people who knew what happened. Nobody touched me. No hugs. They were afraid to. They worried I now associated touch with something bad. And maybe I did but nobody tried so that I could determine that. <br><br>My friend had been visiting his parents out of town when it happened. My mom called him the following morning and told him he needed to come back and be here with me. He wrapped the holidays up with his family and was there 2 days later. A full week before he was meant to fly home. <br><br>He comes over. We<sq>re sitting on the couch. I bluntly tell him what happened. I immediately start sobbing for the first time. I think with him around I finally felt safe enough to let the wave wash over me. I remember a brief moment where I was afraid he wouldn<sq>t hug me out of fear that I wouldn<sq>t want to be touched. I wanted to be held. I was so afraid he wouldn<sq>t.<br><br>As I sat there sobbing he announced, <dq>I<sq>m going to hug you. Tell me if that is ok.<dq> And I nodded yes. He said sternly, <dq>No. Say it. Tell me I can touch you.<dq>  I paused and looked at him confused. I said <dq>Yes you can touch me.<dq> And he immediately wrapped his arms around me. He caressed my back and touched my face and patted me like a cat marking it<sq>s territory with it<sq>s scent. It felt so good to finally have loving touch. <br><br>He pulled away. Sat back on the couch. Looked at me and smiled. I hadn<sq>t seen a smile in days. Everyone who looked at me was sad. It was pity. Not my friends. He had this big toothy sincere grin on his face. Looking at him made me smile. Like a mirrored response. The corners of my mouth just naturally went up. That was nice. <br><br>Still smiling he leans in looking me right in the eye and says, <dq>You are amazing. You are so strong and I am so inspired by you.<dq> I was confused. I didn<sq>t feel like any of that. I felt broken. He continued, <dq>You have taught me so much about the strength of a person. You have taught me survival. You are NOT a victim. You won<sq>t get away with acting like one around me. Because you aren<sq>t. You are a *survivor.* You survived.<dq> Still smiling. <br><br>That word--survivor--it switched something in my brain. Suddenly I felt empowered. Like I could actually move on from this. Like fuck yea I<sq>m kind of a badass. I was raped and spit on and beat and thought I was going to die but fuck all that. I<sq>m up and moving and taking showers, making eggs, playing with my dogs and living my life because I fought and won my right to do those things. I am a survivor! <br><br>I realize now his reason for making me verbalize permission for him to hug me. He needed me to take some control back. He knew I needed my demands to hold weight because the last demands obviously did not. He also knew I needed to feel his embrace so that I<sq>d know I could be touched and be ok with it. That I would know he wasn<sq>t afraid of me. But mostly he needed me to feel powerful again. Unafraid. Determined. To go on living my life. <br><br>I<sq>ve come out the other side of that a stronger person. I have my moments but I don<sq>t let them last long because I am a survivor dammit. Nobody gets to make me feel that way. I decide how I feel and I decided I<sq>m going to be happy and laugh and hug people. <br><br>In your mind she has to stop being a victim. You need to see her as one of the strongest and bravest people you know. Because she is. She is a survivor. Help her to see that. <br><br>Edit<colon> Thank you guys. I appreciate the supportive responses. I hope it helps OP a little. Also thank you for the gold! </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Something I posted earlier today on this subject<colon> <br><br>A lot of women don<sq>t realize this, but men still have the role of <dq>provider<dq> during sex. While some women have an idea of this, because their partner will be overly focused on making sure she orgasms - which can put pressure on her and make it less likely - but pressure is always present for men.<br><br>Speaking in terms of generalities, men are more often dominant / expected to be dominant (I think it was 87<percent> of people expected the male to be dominant in the bedroom), and it<sq>s almost universally seen that the man is supposed to be the one to provide the orgasm for the woman (You will see <dq>ladies first<dq> in many conversations about sex, often from guys as its often self imposed).<br><br>So that is two things on top of each other - as a man you have to be the one to take charge, and you are generally tasked or at least feel the responsibility of making sure your partner climaxes. It should be noted that taking charge is also part and parcel of initiating, which means it<sq>s often up to the man to make sure his partner is <dq>in the mood<dq> so to speak.<br><br>But there are other considerations as well. There is the constant fight to maintain an erection while not reaching orgasm - because either one before your partner does is seen as a failure. And even if your partner comes, there<sq>s the idea that you should be able to do better lingering in the back somewhere. And this is not even entirely in a man<sq>s control. Losing an erection during sex is something that just happens. And sometimes no matter how hard you try to hold it back, that orgasm just comes. These are physiological responses which can be sort of controlled, but not entirely (for most people anyway).<br><br>Might as well also say that the whole penis situation can be even more complicated because many women expect their partner please them with their penis (even if not realistic) and many if not most men feel like if they can<sq>t please their partner with their penis they are failures of men. This is one of the places the penis insecurity comes from that is so often on display in this sub.<br><br>So, while all that is going on, you also have to consider that sex is much more physically taxing for men in pretty much all positions except for cowgirl. And the fact that it is physically taxing can make it both harder to maintain the erection and harder to not ejaculate.<br><br>Anyhow, it can add up to a pretty stressful experience - and the more you like the other person, the more stressful it gets because there is additional pressure to perform. Losing or failure to get an erection is often construed as lack of interest. PE is viewed as lack of control. etc.<br><br>It<sq>s not to say that sex isn<sq>t enjoyable. It is very much so. But it<sq>s not enjoyable in the same way that masturbation is, where there is no pressure in any way, just relaxation and enjoyment. This is also one of the reasons that many guys often love blowjobs to completion. It<sq>s nice to have a partnered sexual situation where there is absolutely no pressure on you.<br><br>**edit** <br><br>Can<sq>t believe I made bestof!  I<sq>ve been reading all the responses and some of them have been great but some people seem to maybe have gotten the wrong impression.  I<sq>m not trying to blame any one gender or even society.  The challenges (I think) men face in sex are a combination of biological issues and social issues which aren<sq>t necessarily bad, but they just are.  I don<sq>t think women should be faulted in general, but I think anything that helps them understand is good.  <br><br>Also, I love sex.  I don<sq>t feel anxiety about sex and I don<sq>t consider it a <dq>chore<dq> but I also find that it is still taxing in many ways.  Part of being a good lover is putting in the effort to be a good lover, and being a good lover is something I concern myself with.  Sex definitely has the potential to be much, much more fulfilling than masturbation - and if I wasn<sq>t clear on that I would like to make that point here.  But just because it has that potential doesn<sq>t make amazing by default.  <br><br>*P.S.* Thank you to my anonymous benefactor for the gold.  It<sq>s greatly appreciated.  </p>",

Don<sq>t know if it ever got physical, but based on the texts I found, I doubt it would have taken long.<br><br>Even as I confronted her with the texts, even as I was throwing up from grief after I drove thirty miles to stay with my mom that night, even as I slid the dissolution paperwork across the table for her to sign, I was concerned with her wellbeing.

I also lost a child, so I<sq>m familiar with the pain your<sq>e experiencing.  You two should find a grief counselor to help you through this.  Do so immediately.  You may need individual counseling as well as couples counseling.  I found that my husband grieved in a much different way than I did, so don<sq>t expect your wife to grieve the same way or for the same amount of time as you. We grieved together and helped each other through the hard times; he was my support through it all.  You move on by taking it day by day, and if that is too hard then you take it hour by hour or minute by minute.  Force yourself to get out of bed and shower each day. Eat three meals and go for a short walk.  Go back to work.  You<sq>ll go through the motions of life feeling numb because of your loss, but eventually some feeling will come back.....a little more each day.  What was your baby<sq>s name?  I found that I talked about my Matthew a lot, as it kept him alive in my mind.  Your friends will be well-meaning, but might disappear or do/say weird things.  Don<sq>t hold it against them, as they just don<sq>t know how to react or support you through this.  Find comfort, peace and solace in your wife.  Celebrate together the life you created in your child and the short time you spent with your baby.  Eventually, the pain will decrease to where you can function normally again.  The pain of losing your child will never leave, but it takes it<sq>s place in the history of your marriage and allows you to move forward together.  Take it a step at a time and eventually you<sq>ll get there.  </p>",

There, <dq>too emotionally invested<dq> is understood as caring much more than the other person does, or caring too much considering the amount of time you<sq>ve spent together (e.g. one level of caring might be appropriate for someone you<sq>ve dated for two months but inappropriate for a first date).<br><br>However the idea of <dq>who cares least wins<dq> is a corruption of that.

Knowing that he is an object of your sexual affection at that moment is confidence-building, and will certainly lend to a fantastic evening.<br><br>- Cuddles. Even if you gotta turn him around and sit on his lap, physical contact is key. If he<sq>s doing something, hug him from behind and give him neck kisses or head scratches.<br><br>- Ask him things. From how his day is, to what he<sq>s reading, to what he<sq>s doing. Obviously, try not to just fill up empty space. But if he seems heavily invested in something, ask what he<sq>s into. Or, if it looks like he<sq>s having a problem, ask what<sq>s up? Sometime, even if you don<sq>t get it, we like having a sounding board. It calms us to be able to talk to you about our passions.<br><br>- Compliments. We know you think it. <dq>Damn, his ass looks great in those jeans.<dq> But instead of keeping it to yourself, and thinking you are a perv, or he already knows it, just tell him. Men get so few compliments through the day, honestly, this can make a whole week for us.<br><br>- Random Rubs. Footrubs, back rubs, anything. The contact is awesome, even if you don<sq>t actually managed to sooth his knots.<br><br>- Make a cup of Coffee or Tea. Sometimes, in the morning, my girl puts on the kettle and makes coffee. It<sq>s super endearing and i love waking up and just going and making a cup off the bat. It<sq>s small, and easily missed, but i love it.<br><br>- Know what he likes. It<sq>s simple, but it helps. Like someone said in this thread, simply showing up at work one day with a candy bar made his day.

In a world in which almost everyone is straight, it<sq>s nearly impossible to meet potential partners of the same sex face-to-face unless you have some agreed upon area where almost everyone is gay/bi (such as a gay bar).<br><br>Consider a gay guy who goes on a ski trip in a group of 160 people. That<sq>s already a huge group that<sq>s bigger than most. Educated estimates for LGBT people are about 5<percent> of the population, so that means probably about 8 people in the group are gay or bi. Now image that you wanted to do what straight people often do, meet someone, hang out, maybe even have some sexy-time. Half of those 8 will be women, and only half will be single. So that brings it down to 2 single gay guys including yourself in the entire group.<br><br>The odds are astronomically stacked against you and the other single gay guy meeting each other and knowing that each other are gay. After all, there is no magical way of determining which of the 159 others is gay, and there are often severe penalties for guessing if someone is gay. On top of all that, you have all the typical issues with finding a partner that straight people face. So even if you manage to identify the one other single gay gay, you very well might not be each other<sq>s type.<br><br>On the other hand, if you<sq>re straight (or a bisexual looking for someone of the opposite sex), all these extra barriers are removed. Although they might not be interested in you for other reasons, you can safely assume that others are attracted to the opposite-sex.<br><br>In case some of you read this comment and think, <dq>But meeting potential partners isn<sq>t the only purpose of going to bars. Equality means that straight people should be just as welcome into gay bars as gays should be welcome at other bars.<dq><br><br>You have to realize that this isn<sq>t just the only _bar_ in which gay people might get the luxury of being able to assume that others are gay/bi, it<sq>s usually the only _place_ in which gays/lesbians may have that luxury. So for many gay people, a gay bar can have much more significance than being a watering hole. Statistics show that the majority of straight people meet their SO randomly (friends of friends, work, etc.), which works because straight people have the luxury of being able to assume that each other are straight. The number percentage of straight people who meet their SO in a place like a bar is very low. On the flip side, meeting a potential SO in <dq>meat space<dq> outside of a place (such as a gay bar) or event specifically designed to cater to LGBT people because gay people usually is very difficult for lesbians/gays because they can<sq>t assume others are gay/lesbian (or bi).<br><br>We fill buildings with escalators and stairs for the convenience for the vast majority of people, but there is a small subgroup of people who cannot use those amenities. For them, large communities build elevators and automatic doors to better accommodate them. Now it<sq>s fine if people who can walk use the elevator, but if they crowd it or treat it such that disabled people can no longer use it comfortably then that<sq>s a problem.<br><br>A bunch of people crowding out a guy on a wheel chair from getting on an elevator, when they also have the option of using an escalator, that<sq>s not equality. In fact, it makes things less equal because it lessens that guy<sq>s access to the same benefits (moving up/down floors) that everyone else has access to. If they further go, <dq>Well you should be happy that we<sq>re comfortable enough to use the same elevator as you!<dq> that would make it that much worse because people are patting themselves on the back for doing something that makes it less equal for guy in the wheel chair.<br><br>...all that being said, I don<sq>t think it<sq>s _intrinsically_ wrong for a straight person to go to a gay bar. But unless the straight person is going as a wingman/woman for his/her LGB friend, I think it would be very inconsiderate to not at least seriously think about going somewhere first.<br><br></p>",

He was so nice. He was also 27 vs our 20, quite unattractive and we had been together for 5 years at that point. We talked about getting engaged and I had a plan ready and all, so when I got that intuition, I put it down to being ridiculous.<br><br>She said he asked her out for dinner and she always had such a bad time meeting new people and making friends and I had deep trust after five years, I said go for it, you make friends. It started going downhill after that. She<sq>d text him often, send Snapchats. It got really bad that she spent a lot of Christmas 2014 on her phone with him. I was pissed off, but again put it down to her making a good mate. It<sq>s easy to recognise the signs in hindsight, I know it sounds ridiculous in writing.<br><br>So for our Xmas present, we decided to go on our first trip alone together, to Paris. I always wanted to go and she thought it was really romantic. Day before we went she was really moody. Later found out it was because she was developing feelings for him. And something happened, never found out what.<br><br>She continued to be extremely moody the entire trip. Now. I am a very, very positive person, to the point where anyone who meets me will immediately describe me as cheerful. I couldn<sq>t manage that over two days. I freaked at her, why the hell was she like this, we<sq>re in Paris? Paris. City of love. Alone. We can do whatever the fuck we want why wasn<sq>t she happy?<br><br>She didn<sq>t say anything, kept saying nothing was wrong. We got back to Ireland, she was even more moody and I asked for space, because I needed time to cool off. Told her I love her, just need space.<br><br>Cue a couple of days of minimal contact and she said she doesn<sq>t want to talk for a couple of weeks. Turns out during that time, she was hanging out with him everyday. She then ended it. I remember every moment of that breakup. She handed me a bag of all my things that I had in her house over the years. It was really heavy. My headphones were playing Extreme - More Than Words, can<sq>t hear it now without a flashback. She was crying. I was emotionless until I went out of sight. She hugged me one last time. It<sq>s so weird. I walk by that place everyday and think about it. <br><br>I was gutted, spent the next few months in a depressed and anger filled haze, analysing everything that happened. Pieced together stuff, helped by people telling me things. She never really spoke to me again. It went from Paris to barely speaking and then ending, all within a couple of weeks. It was like she died. I<sq>ll always miss her, hope she<sq>s doing good, but I don<sq>t want her in my life anymore.<br><br>**E**<colon> Forgot to mention that she got with him immediately afterwards, moved in after two months and they<sq>re still together. She basically hopped from me to him.<br><br>I<sq>m in a good place now nearly a year later, but damn. Shit hurt me and radically changed who I am. <br><br>Best thing about Paris though. Made a porno. Ah. Look on the bright side lads.<br><br></p>",

(ex<colon> I see plenty of people on relationship topics focusing on who<sq>s right/wrong instead of trying to find the solution that is the best for the relationship and the people involved.)<br><br>* From personal experience, I believe that 95<percent> of men/women differences are due to gender norms/societal constructs rather than biological reasons. I found myself thinking a lot <dq>like a woman<dq> when I found myself in situations mostly experienced by women. Consequently, I think anyone who tries to justify their views on gender relations with <dq>back when we were cavemen<dq> is an idiot (mostly because I<sq>ve never seen someone make a solid argument when using that premise).<br><br>* Men who claim being an asshole is what get you laid are idiots incapable to combine being nice and being confident and will only land women who aren<sq>t worth it.<br><br>* Most men who complain about false rape accusation aren<sq>t even close to getting laid in the first place and aren<sq>t doing it because they care about men but as a way to discredit feminism and women<sq>s issues.<br><br>* Men associating meat with masculinity are playing the game of the meat industry without even realizing it. Meat tastes great but it doesn<sq>t make you more of a man, you<sq>re not hunting it in the woods with your spear. <br><br>* Given the amount of effort the average woman puts in her appearance, men shouldn<sq>t be whining when asked to put some effort as well.<br><br></p>",

In fact, when he appeared in court I was the only one standing next to him while the perpetrator (defendant) had 3 case workers helping her in addition to her attorney.

                "answer": "<p>For sex? Never. One trip to Pound Town is all those puppies can handle. However, I<sq>ve found that there are a ton of other creative ways to reuse condoms if you<sq>re looking to lessen that carbon footprint. Here<sq>s my fun list of eight ways to be green with condom reuse<colon>            <br><br>1. **Trashcan liner.** This is a simple one, but you<sq>d be surprised at how effective they are. Leftover cum really helps the trash stick to the bag and not end up all over your floor. If you want that supply of used condoms to keep coming, you need to keep your living space clean.          <br><br>2. **Water balloon.** Everyone loves a good water balloon fight as the weather heats up! Reusing condoms is a perfect way to ensure that you<sq>re always the winner.       <br><br>3. **Gardening gloves.** Every real man has a garden. Growing your own food is sexy and sustainable. The cum on the inside of a reused condom creates a tight seal onto your hands to make sure that you don<sq>t get all dirty while you<sq>re planting, and later harvesting, the fruits (or should I say veggies?) of your labor.          <br><br>4. **Thundersticks.** Noise-makers like [these](http<colon>//minisportsballs.putyournameonit.com/images/other_product_photos/noisesticks.jpg) are great to have at sporting events, but I<sq>ve never seen them sell for cheap. You get the same effect by blowing up two used condoms and smacking them together as you<sq>d get with the traditional product! Not to mention how much everyone will respect and admire you for having had sex two times.      <br><br>5. **Ice pack.** Sometimes life gets hard. You bang your head or you end up sick after a night of debauchery. By filling up a used condom with water and popping it in the freezer, you<sq>ve created a handy ice pack to ease what ails you. No more need to keep lame frozen vegetables in your house!       <br>  <br>6. **Icing bag.** Making someone a homemade cake is a great way to show that you love them. However, a layman might not always have the tools on hand to construct a well-decorated cake. By filling up a used condom with icing and then cutting a slit in the tip, you have an icing bag to pipe out decorations in no time.     <br><br>7. **Wrapping paper.** When you<sq>re giving the perfect gift, you often need to conceal it or protect it before the giftee opens it up. It<sq>s easy to toss a bunch of used condoms in a gift bag to serve either function. No more cutting, folding, or taping wrapping paper ever again!      <br><br>8. **Toothbrush travel case.** As I<sq>m sure your dentist tells you every six months, you need to brush your teeth every night. However, when you<sq>re away from home, it always seems disgusting to just toss your toothbrush in your travel bag with your shoes and your underwear. A used condom is shaped perfectly to just drop your toothbrush right in and then get it back out when you need it. You can be sure your toothbrush isn<sq>t getting gross in your bag by wrapping it up. </p>",

The situation is a little different, but the advice is still solid so I will repost it here<colon><br><br>>This sounds a little too weirdly close to what happened to me so I thought id weigh in. I<sq>m 23 and she was 22, had been living together. I had several girlfriends before her but she was my first love. <br><br>>Right at the end of October 2015 my girlfriend of 3 years left me after I found out she had been cheating on me for a couple weeks. Everything was perfect, there were a couple of yellow flags but no obvious red ones. It all just happened within a span of 24 hours. She had been acting weird, I pried for info, she admitted it, and I kicked her out of my apartment. She came a couple days later and got her stuff out of my apartment. I spent the next week texting her trying to get closure or something and trying to fix things even though she cheated (I know I know). After the next week, I never heard from her again.<br><br>>Its been about 3 months now and its getting easier but there are days, more like half-days where I still sit and think about what could<sq>ve been and get really sad. So here<sq>s my advice from someone who just went through this.<br><br>>**Eat**<br><br>>The fist thing that will happen is you will lose your appetite. You need to eat no matter what. You don<sq>t have to eat like you are used to at first, but force food down. It will help you feel better. You will feel like puking, but you won<sq>t.<br><br>>**Go Dark**<br><br>>Block her on all social media. Don<sq>t just unfriend or follow. Block her. You will be tempted to look her up, don<sq>t give in. Also block all her friends that aren<sq>t mutual, any relatives, anyone connecting you to her. Social media is faked happiness. You will look her up and it will seem like she isn<sq>t even hurt, and is having the time of her life. That wont necessarily be real life. It will just make you feel worse.<br><br>>Don<sq>t sub tweet her. Don<sq>t hint at her in some kind of Facebook post. Don<sq>t try to fish for any kind of attention from this situation. Go dark yourself or just proceed as normal. It will help you get back to normal and will also leave more of an impact on her if you are just completely mysterious.<br><br>>Write down her number on a post it, hide the post it in your room somewhere. Keep it for emergencies or whatever. Then delete her number off your phone. DO NOT TEXT HER. You will never get the closure you are seeking. Trust me. She broke our trust and that is something that is almost impossible to gain back. She<sq>s gone.<br><br>>**<dq>Get over her<dq>**<br><br>>They say the best way to get over a girl is to get under another. This is fairly true. You should probably get a fling or two under your belt. But be careful not to try and scrap together a new relationship. The purpose of this is to have rebound sex. It really does help to do so. But any relationship you try to start will be doomed and fail miserably, it will hurt you more than you started. Get a fling or so. Then stop. The sexual tension void you are missing will be fulfilled, you will have first hand experience about more fish in the sea, and then you can move on to the next step. <br><br>>**Time to focus on yourself**<br><br>>The hardest thing about what you are experiencing is the extreme change in comfort and routine. She always went to sleep in your bed, you always woke up with her, she was always around, always texting. This is the hardest part. Here<sq>s what I did to cope with that<colon><br><br>>I joined a gym. Clich\u00e9 I know. But it helps. You look better, you will feel better, and it gives you a change in lifestyle and something to look forward to every day. <br><br>>Change it up. She didn<sq>t like me with long hair. I started to grow my hair out. Deleted all the music off my phone that she put on there that I never cared for. Bought new clothes so I would have something that I could wear that was <dq>just mine<dq>. I even change the placement of all the furniture in my living room. You need to start straying away from things that you all did together, at least for now. In a couple months, it will be ok to watch those shows again, or go to those restaurants again. For now, avoid them. When I miss texting her ill text my bros or my family instead. When I feel lonely, ill put on music that cheers me up (I had a breakup/cheer up playlist. I can give to you on request).<br><br>>**Enjoy your freedom**<br><br>>Last step. Don<sq>t rush into another relationship. Just enjoy your freedom. Eat where you want. Dress how you want. Hang out with your friends when you want. Drink when you want. Go to bars and clubs. Sprawl out all over the bed at night. Poop with the door open. Walk around naked. Its a liberating feeling just completely working on yourself.<br><br>>All in all, life has a crazy way of sending you on paths and I believe everything happens for a reason. The fact is she cheated on you so be happy that it happened now, because it would<sq>ve happened eventually. The best revenge is success and happiness. She doesn<sq>t deserve you now. Someone out there does.<br><br>>I hope I could help at all. Good luck and feel free to reply or PM me<br><br>In your particular situation, what you should realize is that she doesn<sq>t deserve you. You gave her everything and she literally gave you nothing. You don<sq>t miss her, you just miss the idea of having someone around; the fear of loneliness and the unknown. <br>The more time that passes, the easier it will be to see that you are better off. Nothing but time will help that.<br><br>More importantly, its over. The trust is gone and no matter what people say its almost impossible to get back. You will never have the closure you want from her and it will never be the same with her again. <br><br>Good luck </p>",

Use one anyway, even if she<sq>s not crazy.  <br>2. Have a plan of *some* kind. Doesn<sq>t matter if it<sq>s career or generally life related. Having goals is good.  <br>3. Save your money. Sure, splurge on nice things now and again, but it<sq>s really nice to see a big wad of money in a savings account.  It gives you a lot of peace of mind when you<sq>re not stressed about money.  Have a budget and stick to it.<br>4. Chill. Not everything<sq>s worth getting worked up over.  <br>5. Know general life stuff. Changing tires, changing oil, doing taxes, cooking. If you don<sq>t know it, find people that do and ask them to teach you. Hardly anyone will say no when you ask nicely and it<sq>ll make them feel good for being useful.  <br>6. In that vein, *ask for help when you need it*. You<sq>re not an island to yourself, bub. Admittedly, this one is hard. Took me to 35 to get good at it.  <br>7. Smoking hot women are great. But if they<sq>re high maintenance, good fucking luck. Hold out for that one you<sq>re really attracted to that is uncomplicated. In the meantime, refer to point #1. <br>8. Get a hobby and join a club related to it. They<sq>re great for meeting new people.  <br>9. Be curious. Always wondered how something worked? Or who built a particular thing? All of mankind<sq>s knowledge is in the palm of your hand now, just seconds away. Reduce your ignorance.  <br>10. Get fit, stay fit. I<sq>m not talking olympic athlete fit, but fit to where you<sq>re not winded climbing a few flights of stairs. There<sq>s a lot to see in life so don<sq>t let yourself check out early.  <br>11. Find a job you tolerate, at the least. <dq>Following your dreams<dq> is great and all, but if it doesn<sq>t pay the bills, good luck. That underwater basketweaving degree is a fucking waste. Don<sq>t do it. Find a job with reasonable income that you can tolerate if it<sq>s not something you actually love. See #8 for feeding your soul and following your dreams. If it turns out the job you love pays well, great!  <br>12. Lastly, travel. Sounds cliche, but if you travel you end up as a much more open minded person, seeing people<sq>s different points of view. It<sq>ll be a lot easier to see wider-scope ramifications of a lot of things, and how we effect each other on a big scale. I<sq>m not saying you have to travel internationally - shit the US here is *giant* with lots of variety. Start small. Go the next state over. Go 3 states over. Just go. You<sq>ll be glad you did.</p>",

So she was a stay-at-home mom while I earned all the money to support the family.<br><br>Throughout our marriage that lasted just under ten years, I paid for everything. I paid the mortgage, I saved for our daughter<sq>s college, for retirement, etc. I paid my (ex)wife<sq>s student loans off before my own (which I<sq>m still working on, 16 years out from law school). I paid for her to get braces, because the first time she had them as a teenager, she didn<sq>t wear her retainer enough and her teeth went crooked again. I paid for all our vacations, our cars, etc. All of it.<br><br>And despite all this, she had an affair. And wasn<sq>t even remotely interested in ending it. So we divorced, and in the current no-fault regime, she got half of our assets, PLUS alimony. That<sq>s right, folks, she cheated on me but I<sq>m still stuck paying alimony to her. It<sq>s all based on a formula; there<sq>s no room for significant deviations and her bad behavior is completely ignored. (This is in addition to child support. I don<sq>t mind child support; it<sq>s my responsibility to support my child.)<br><br>So I don<sq>t know if I<sq>m ever getting married again.

I have written an open letter to the straight community to explain the nuances,  <br><br>Dear straight people<colon> <br><br>Generally speaking, you are perfectly welcome in our bars, as long as you keep in mind that they are spaces that are not intended to cater to you - if you think that<sq>s unfair, then go cry about it ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD, since that<sq>s the space that DOES cater to you, pretty much exclusively.  You know that sense of discomfort and alienation that you sometimes feel in our bars? That<sq>s how we feel in virtually every social space we go to, so please do not begrudge us this one public place on Earth where we can pay for the <dq>privilege<dq> to hit on, dance with, and make out with people we actually find attractive without watching our backs.  <br><br>For straight women, respecting the importance of our sanctuaries means that you should recognize gay bars are not an ideal place to hold your bachelorette party (in jurisdictions where we are not allowed to marry, that<sq>s particularly tacky); that, if you are a young attractive woman, you will not be the centre of attention that you are accustomed to being in straight bars, and that just because you are among a bunch of gay dudes does not mean you have free reign to drunkenly grope us on the dance floor or at the bar (by the same token, we do not have the right to paw at your boobs just because we are gay; I invite you to put any drunken gay lout who does so firmly in his place).<br><br>For straight men (particularly good-looking ones), you should prepare for the very real possibility that a gay dude might make a pass at you while you are at a gay bar.  If you can<sq>t find it in yourself to politely decline a pass from another guy, then stay the hell out. Most of the time saying something like, <dq>I<sq>m flattered, but straight<dq> will be the end of it, but remember that some gay guys are jerks, just like some straight guys are jerks, and will likewise not respond well to having their advances rebuffed.  If you don<sq>t think you can handle that, then you can be sure that your night will be better spent in a straight bar, no matter how much better our music is (and it IS).<br><br>Finally, for straight couples, try to have some decorum.  We don<sq>t resent your dancing together or engaging in modest displays of affection. If, however, you descend into a full-blown grinding/makeout session on the dance floor, it kind of sends the signal that you are trying to lay claim to our space, and we may not take kindly to that. Again, you can console yourself with the knowledge that you can do that kind of thing pretty much anywhere else on the planet; you should be more than content with that.<br><br>In closing, feel free to come to a gay bar, as long as you respect the fact that it<sq>s a GAY bar.<br><br>Gaily Yours,<br><br>Esperandopara</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I think I<sq>m going to go for the contrarian bit in this thread.<br><br>I<sq>m 33, childless, never married.  I make well above the median family income in my country.  I rent a place (because real estate is fucking expensive, and I generate higher returns on my investment than through real estate) and have plenty of savings, no debts and enough disposable income to spend it on whatever hobby/whim takes my fancy as well as 6 months of <sq>fuck you<sq> money.  I work a regular 9-5 job, I have plenty of hobbies to keep me busy, and I have plenty of freedom to make my own schedule and come and go as I please.  The last 6 months have also been particularly good in terms of getting laid.<br><br>So in terms of blatant selfishness and material things, life is good.  In terms of relationshippy stuff?  That part I<sq>m not so sure about.  Most of my friends are in long-term relationships ranging from 5-12 years and are on course to to the married-with-children stuff.  I<sq>ve never been able to make it past 3 years with any of my ex-girlfriends.  And in that area, I acknowledge my failings.  They<sq>re exes because I didn<sq>t have the necessary game at the time to successfully manage their emotions.<br><br>Nowadays a lot of the women I meet are interesting, but come with a past - children, ex-husbands, abusive ex-husbands/bfs and the like.  I can tell the ones without children (late 20s-early 30s) are wanting to settle down, nest and have kids.  While I don<sq>t want kids *now* I<sq>m not so certain it<sq>ll always be that way that I<sq>m willing to get snipped.  Looking at the quality of women I<sq>m able to attract, while contrasting with the seemingly happy and secure relationships my friends have (and the comparatively higher-calibre wo/men they<sq>re with), I can<sq>t help but wondering if I missed my chance at love and marriage (or am somehow judged not worthy of it) in my 20s.  Certainly those were the years I was looking my best and when most people get married.  And a lot of days, especially after a bad date, it certainly seems like I missed it.<br><br>In the darker moments of self-doubt, I wonder, *<sq>If I were worthy of a gf and a stable relationship, wouldn<sq>t I have found one by now?  Did I miss my chance?  Am I destined to end up either a lifelong bachelor, or will I have to lower my standards so much that it becomes not a choice of yes/no but <sq>the lesser of all red flags<sq>?  A lot of people have met their match by now, so what<sq>s so wrong with me that I don<sq>t get to experience this?<sq>*  The idea that I may be broken and unworthy of love is a tough notion to shake some days.  And I admit, I<sq>m not perfect.  I come with my own grab-bag of tics, hang-ups and scars.<br><br>That being said, would I change anything?  Fuck no.  I<sq>m a product of every choice I<sq>ve ever made, I<sq>m proud of most of <sq>em, and I<sq>m mostly happy with myself.  With hindsight, my life is better than it<sq>s ever been.  Is it exactly 100<percent> the way I want?  No.  And even *with* knowing the odds of divorce, getting fucked out of my money, the odds of dead-bedroom, infidelity, fighting, weight-gain and the whole bit, I still want to have a partner-in-crime, somebody to grow with, somebody to build enough trust with to try all the kinky bedroom stuff with.  Just to try and see if I can do it.<br><br>But I have to remind myself that it<sq>s a long life.  A lot can happen in a year or two.  And relationships are not all unicorn farts and rainbows.  They<sq>re tough, and 99<percent> aren<sq>t worth saving.  But, life is tough, deal with it.  There<sq>s no guarantees.  I just gotta keep being me to the best of my abilities and have faith things will work themselves out.  And like I said, it ain<sq>t all bad - this year I<sq>m getting my motorcycle license, my SCUBA license, and my gun license.  That should keep me well and truly occupied.  And in the meantime, there are women to love, things to do, wine to drink and enemies to be defeated.    <br><br>What more could I want?   </p>",

Then she tries to get on top, not really working, so she gets up, sits on the sink, and just curls her finger at me in the <dq>come here<dq> motion. Amazing, primal, very quick bathroom sex. Probably in and out in ten minutes. Bit of a line outside the bathroom by then, mix of smirks and glares from the people in line on our way out, but SO worth it</p>",

There<sq>s an extent to which we all do, and in fact should, judge one another by their looks.

Don<sq>t stay with a woman if you<sq>re not feeling the relationship just because you<sq>re afraid to hurt her by breaking up.  Your happiness matters.<br><br>2a. And for fuck<sq>s sake don<sq>t marry her either.  You<sq>ll only end up being a gigantic turd rather than a little pea-sized turd... or else stuck in a miserable marriage.<br><br>3.  DO stick your dick in crazy.  There are some good times to be had there.  Just bring your own condoms and use them, and don<sq>t give her your home address if you can help it.  It<sq>s like the rodeo<colon> ride it until shit becomes too dangerous, then fuck right off as quickly as possible and let some other clown handle her.<br><br>4.  The pumice soap LAVA is excellent at washing away / masking early-in-the-day sex with a girl, in preparation for sex with a different later-in-the-day girl.  Likely any good deodorant soap will do, but Lava is the best.  Avoid plain ass soap.<br><br>5.  When you<sq>re financially and geographically able, get yourself a dog.  ~~Get a dog that will, at adulthood, weigh more than 30 pounds.~~   Experience unmitigated love and joy.<br><br>5a.  When your dog has reached the end of his or her life, do not draw the process out unnecessarily.  Use good judgement, keep them as long as you can while they are still happy, but do not prolong any suffering for purely selfish reasons.  Letting them go at the proper time and with minimal suffering is your last gift to them.  And, as hard as it is, be there with them.  You will not regret it later in life. <br><br>6.  A college education CAN be beneficial to your career, but you need not have one to succeed.  Especially if your family is not well-off enough to cover the cost (or unless you have a full scholarship, etc).  Avoid becoming a career student.<br><br>7.  Learn how to fight.  Anything will do really, just spend some time learning the basics, I recommend Krav Maga.  You need not be some MMA bruiser, and at some point, those lessons may save your life or the life of an innocent.<br><br>8.  Learn how to handle a firearm, even if you have no intention of using one.  Even if you<sq>re terrified of them.  Especially if you<sq>re terrified of them.  You don<sq>t have to be a gun nut or even keep a gun, but knowing how to use one is proper knowledge.<br><br>9.  Getting married?  DO NOT rush into parenthood.  Spend some years doing the DINK thing, and make sure you are both mentally and financially prepared for the shitstorm.<br><br>10.  Not feeling the whole parenthood thing?  Like, ever, in the foreseeable future?  Consider getting a vasectomy, you can pay a very modest fee and have some sperm frozen in case you ever really want to have your own kids.  A vasectomy opens up ALL KINDS of cool options, and it<sq>s really the best birth control out there apart from a woman getting a hysterectomy. <br><br><br></p>",

My personal second-favorite. (r/magictavern)<br><br>* **[Hello Internet](http<colon>//www.hellointernet.fm/)**<colon> Podcast by YouTubers [CGPGrey](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) and [Brady Haran](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos) where they discuss various topics, from the home-work life balance to how they make videos. (r/CGPGrey)<br><br>* **[Lore](http<colon>//www.lorepodcast.com/)**<colon> Aaron Mahnke explores the history behind scary stories and myths. Very thoroughly researched. (r/lorepodcast)<br><br>* **[Serial](https<colon>//serialpodcast.org/)**<colon> From the creators of This American Life, follows a true story and unfolds it over the course of the season. Highly acclaimed. (r/serialpodcast)<br><br>* **[The Black Tapes](http<colon>//theblacktapespodcast.com/)**<colon> Serialized fictional documentary drama following a journalist<sq>s search to uncover an enigmatic conspiracy. Also quite highly acclaimed. (r/theblacktapes)<br><br>* **[The Message](http<colon>//themessagepodcast.com/)**<colon> Fictional serialized miniseries presented as a factual podcast about the research of a group of scientists into an extraterrestrial signal received during WWII by the US government. Has a few issues with pacing, but overall I really liked it. (r/TheMessagePodcast)<br><br>* **[The Moth](http<colon>//themoth.org/)**<colon> Storytellers tell real stories to live crowds, unscripted. They<sq>ve been around since 1997, so they<sq>ve had a lot of time to refine their art. Though not as much as...<br><br>* **[This American Life](http<colon>//www.thisamericanlife.org/)**<colon> Weekly public broadcast program that generally deals with nonfiction journalism, covering topics and stories one might not always hear on normal public radio. (Off the top of my head, they did a fascinating episode on a collaborative manufacturing project between Toyota and GM meant to improve both companies that worked to some extent, but was ultimately ended. Just one of many, many examples.) Highly recommend. (r/ThisAmericanLife)<br><br>* **[The NoSleep Podcast](http<colon>//www.thenosleeppodcast.com/)**<colon> Pretty obvious one. Produced by David Cummings, the podcast tells choice stories selected from our very own r/nosleep. A must-listen for any horror fan. (r/NosleepAudio)<br><br>* **[Wait, Wait... Don<sq>t Tell Me](http<colon>//www.npr.org/podcasts/344098539/wait-wait-don-t-tell-me)**<colon> Another well known one. NPR news quiz featuring various panelists trying to answer questions regarding the previous week<sq>s news. Often funny, though the humor doesn<sq>t always work for everyone. I find it<sq>s a great way to keep up with the news when I have a busy week. (r/WaitWait)<br><br>* **[Welcome to Night Vale](http<colon>//www.welcometonightvale.com/)**<colon> My personal favorite, and one of **the best podcasts** out there, bar none. The podcast features the (fictional) community radio program of the (fictional) town of Night Vale where things are...strange, to say the least. There<sq>s really no way to describe it, it must be experienced firsthand. (r/nightvale)<br><br>* **[King Falls AM](http<colon>//www.kingfallsam.com/)**<colon> It<sq>s slightly similar to WtNV, in that it follows a similar <dq>community radio in a strange town<dq> conceit, but the two podcasts are quite different in terms of tone, character, and story. I can definitely recommend giving it a listen. (r/KingFallsAM)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>>Me and my SO have fallen into the trap of always initiating sex in the same way. We<sq>re beginning to find this a bit boring and want some different ways in which we can both initiate. <br><br>My advice is not so much about new ways to initiate, as how to maintain readiness. Here are some tips I<sq>ve shared before.<br><br>Girls like it when you fondle their . . . minds. <br><br>There are two parts to sexual tension<colon> <br><br>* Build-up<colon> flirting, foreplay, etc.<br><br>* Release<colon> sex.<br><br>Where some guys go wrong is trying to skip from build-up to release. This usually fails. Like trying to pop an empty balloon. The better the build-up, the greater the release. <br><br>If you get the build-up right, the release will almost take care of itself. You and your partner *will* find ways to release. Often spontaneous, exciting ways that are better than what you could have planned. Initiating will happen (by you or her) nearly effortlessly.<br><br>There<sq>s a saying that men are like microwaves and women are like ovens. Men get horny fast and it<sq>s over fast. Women are slower to heat up but last longer.<br><br>What I<sq>ve found works best when flirting in a relationship is to consistently keep your girl at a simmer, so she<sq>s always more open to the idea of sexy times. <br><br>You might tap into her lust that day, you might not. You have that luxury to choose. Sometimes it builds up so much passion that she has to jump on you instead.<br><br>Her mind is a major erogenous zone. Words, metaphors and imagery can be a huge turn-on. Language and hints are her porn.<br><br>Ideas<colon><br><br>* Physical affection and touching.<br><br>* Flirting and teasing. Talk, phone calls, text. <br><br>* Do romantic things for her--*outside* of normal holidays. Big gestures can come off as desperate and needy. I<sq>ve found little things can be deadly effective, e.g. cute post-it notes, a pack of her favorite snack on her desk at work, etc. <br><br>* Hot tip<colon> if you know when she<sq>s on her period or going through tough times and do something nice for her unexpectedly (like when you<sq>re not there with her), it<sq>s 10x more powerful. Thoughtfulness trumps the amount of money spent. <br><br>Women seem to love little pleasant surprises and variety. Don<sq>t do it all the time to the point you drown her in affection and kill the effect; enough to get her excited once in a while and keep her on her toes.<br><br>The key is to *don<sq>t do these things only when you want sex that day*. Women figure that out fast and feel manipulated. That<sq>s when they start to get suspicious and resentful whenever you do something nice for them, because they think a request for sex is coming.<br><br>The foreplay started with that compliment you gave her on the hot new dress she bought last week. Foreplay is an ongoing process. On the flip side, maybe she<sq>s denying sex now because you argued with her best friend six months ago.<br><br>Easier to flirt all the time, but not escalate to sex every time. Make it a lottery, not an ATM transaction. Random, unpredictable payoffs are addictive (ask any gambler).<br><br>Don<sq>t spend 100 percent of your time with her. You have work, hobbies and friends, a well-rounded life. Give her the gift of missing you. Ideally, she should be drowning in sexy anticipation, wondering when you<sq>re going up and ravish her. <br><br>If it<sq>s a new relationship and you<sq>ve hooked up with her a few times<colon> when you<sq>re out of bed, remind her of a specific detail. Something she would associate with sexy times. A special naughty secret only you two would know. Make it a secret game for only the two of you.<br><br>I did this accidentally the first few times by being flirty and goofy and just trying to make things fun. Eventually I caught on to the effect it had on girls. <br><br>For example, there was a girl who liked to tie her hair back before we would get down to it. Sometimes, I<sq>d hold her long hair in my hand instead.<br><br>* One time, she was washing her face. I saw some hairs straying, so I helpfully swept back some of her hair and gripped it in my hand. She shivered a little and immediately gave me *that* look. That was by accident, before I realized it was a turn-on. It was like Pavlovian conditioning, where she associated the feeling of her hair in my hand with intimacy.<br><br>* She texted me she was coming over. I jokingly texted her back<colon> <dq>Bring a hair strap.<dq> Then I went back to watching TV and promptly forgot about it. She told me later that drove her wild. She couldn<sq>t drive fast enough.<br><br>* At a boring party, I whispered in her ear<colon> <dq>Let<sq>s get out of here and go somewhere you can put your hair up for me.<dq> She grabbed my hand and pulled me along into an empty room.<br><br>* If you<sq>re feeling daring and risque, reference that sexy thing with innocent-sounding language when you<sq>re both among other people. <dq>Ah yes, my girlfriend always has the prettiest hair straps,<dq> you say, while giving her a knowing, naughty look. Warning<colon> some girls are horrified by this. Others get embarrassed but also crazy turned-on and will act on it with you later in private. <br><br>* Send her a flirty reference just when she<sq>s arrived at work. Girls *hate* it that they<sq>re all turned on but stuck at work thinking about doing it all day long. Let her lust build. Sexual tension builds precisely when it cannot be released. Brace yourself to get pounced on when she gets home. I once texted her a picture of a hair strap in my hand. No message.<br><br>Mix it up<colon> spoken, written, visual, little actions. Feel free to get creative. <br><br>Let her get turned on and writhe in anticipation because she doesn<sq>t know when you<sq>ll make your move. It<sq>s okay to drive her crazy this way. She secretly desires that sweet torture. <br><br>It<sq>s not manipulation, it<sq>s appreciation. You<sq>re making the extra effort to keep things exciting.<br><br>Other examples<colon><br><br>* One girl had this set of high-heeled shoes she always wore when she wanted to seduce me. If she came over wearing those shoes, you knew it was on. She<sq>d rub one foot against the other ankle to draw my eyes to her legs.<br><br>* One girl would spray on this special perfume she knew drove me crazy. When saying hello she<sq>d hug me extra tight so I<sq>d smell her.<br><br>* One girl would reference the time we were late for a party because we were having too much fun fooling around. She<sq>d say things like, <dq>Well, we could always be *late* . . . <dq><br><br>Every girl has her <dq>hair strap.<dq> What<sq>s your girl<sq>s?<br><br>Remember it. Remind her of it. Have fun.<br><br>Warning<colon> this can backfire. Once a girl gets into it she<sq>ll often turn the tables and start doing sexy things to turn *you* on all the time. Their creativity at being naughty knows no limits when unleashed. <br><br>The kinds of phone calls, texts and photos you get from a girl who<sq>s running hot are mind-blowing. Imagine getting more material than you can keep up with. A nice problem to have.<br><br>Hot tip<colon> respect her in public, but keep seducing her in private. A guy who <dq>gets it<dq> like that is a rare prize for women. <br><br>This is a mind shift, but experiment with treating your mission as your SO and your SO as your mistress. I think some women like that they don<sq>t have to bear the burden of being your world, your everything. <br><br>She<sq>s the fun escape from work; she<sq>s the sexy distraction that pulls you away from time to time. Helps to keep up the flirty vibe.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>",

She didn<sq>t take it seriously but thought it was a good idea to bring up now. <br><br>He did the saliva/swab technique (sent it away and got the results back) and found out she wasn<sq>t his.

With only a HS degree it is pretty easy to start at around 70k and you can pretty easily get north of 100k. I know plenty of operators who make more than the engineers, much more once you factor in OT. You get benefits and PTO as well.<br><br>If you can pass a drug test and a fairly easy competence exam, you<sq>re good to go.<br><br>**Edit1<colon>** I<sq>m glad this is drumming up a lot of interest. As soon as I get home later I<sq>ll make another edit including what the job generally entails, what kinds of companies/locations you should be looking at, etc <br><br>**Edit2<colon>** Ok, I think I addressed the people who approached me via message or whatever about what it is they do, how to get there, etc. but I<sq>ll post the general information here.<br><br>In a chemical plant, you have the engineers, and you have the operators. My post specifically talks about the operators. They are the guys on the front lines. Chemical manufacturing plants are basically massive networks of pipes, pumps, heaters, coolers, and they usually revolve around super fat pieces of environment-controlled pipe otherwise known as chemical reactors. Operators are the guys out in the field making sure all that shit works the way it should. They are the ones out in the field turning pumps on and off, getting pressure and temperature readings of critical equipment and logging it, hooking up steam and water hoses where they need to be in order to clean equipment, they open and close valves to direct the process fluids to where they need to be, etc.<br><br>A lot of people think the engineers do all this. 90<percent> of the time, they aren<sq>t. The operators are doing all this. The engineers create the procedures for how to get product from point A to point B, the operators are the ones who actually do it. Additionally, operators are the guys in the control room staring at multiple computer monitors that basically graphically depict the entire chemical plant. It shows process parameters such as pressure, temperature, flowrate, etc. and alarms whenever something gets out of whack. The operators run the show from in here 80<percent> of the time. They become experts on the process.<br><br>It pays a lot beacuse (going back to the original point of the post), there aren<sq>t all that many people doing it and they are critical as fuck. A good operator is worth his weight in gold plus some. Also, if they fuck up, it costs a lot of money, so there really isn<sq>t much leeway to fuck up. If you are caught goofing off, you<sq>re done. If you show up to work late twice, you<sq>re done. If you damage equipment because you weren<sq>t following procedure, you<sq>re done. Also, it<sq>s relatively dangerous. You<sq>re 1/4<dq> of steel away from 10,000 gallons of boiling hot organic chemical, and you<sq>re opening and closing valves. God forbid maintenance fucked up and put the wrong gasket on that flange, and you<sq>re looking at a severe chemical burn at a minimum. It<sq>s very, very rare. But shit like that happens. People die every year in this industry due to the nature of the work. So, there is definitely some risk factor built into the compensation.<br><br>You know what though? Safety is, at every single place I<sq>ve ever worked at, sincerely the most important part of the job. Each company I<sq>ve worked at truly does take it incredibly seriously. It makes sense. Even if you<sq>re a cynical bastard, you need to understand that a workplace death costs a chemical company, on average, $7million. That<sq>s a fuck ton of money and can make or break a weak business unit. It is worth it to spend the extra time and money to keep you standing upright. <br><br>Anywho... if you can pass a drug test and do well on a standardized test, that<sq>s half the battle. After that, if you have any history of manual labor, that<sq>s a nice bonus. A degree is a bonus, but not required. The majority of guys I<sq>ve worked with don<sq>t have them so don<sq>t sweat it if you don<sq>t. The main thing is you are probably going to have to be willing to move since these jobs aren<sq>t exactly geography friendly. Specifically, if you are willing to move to the Gulf Coast or the Great Lakes area (sorry, not Chicago for the most part), you<sq>re going to have a far easier time. If you<sq>re willing to go so far as to work in the middle of buttfuck nowhere Alabama, I<sq>d find it very hard to believe you couldn<sq>t find employment as an operator.<br><br>If you have any questions, feel free to ask. If even one person can improve their life from this info, I<sq>ll consider it a good way to cap the tumultuous year of 2016. <br><br>**TL;DR<colon>** If you<sq>re willing to move, are clean of drugs, are willing to move to possibly undesirable locations, and don<sq>t mind manual work in a chemical plant, you can go forth and stack that skrilla</p>",

                "answer": "<p>You<sq>re not going to like hearing this, but this was the truth for me.<br><br>You are having poor results with women because you *probably* have not taken any time to learn about dating, understanding that dating is all about learning to disqualify bad women, and have not worked on your social skills.  You don<sq>t know what you<sq>re doing.  You just spent, what, 8 years learning about your career?  Exactly how much time have you taken to learn about courtship rituals?  Approaching women?  Self confidence?  Flirting?  Body language?  How to tell if a woman is a good match for you?  Red flags?<br><br>Probably none.  Right?<br><br>You are starting to understand that if you tell women you are a doctor, and/or make a lot of money, and you don<sq>t properly screen women from the get-go, you are going to end up with golddiggers.  Learn from this!<br><br>I can say this because I make almost $150k a year, and I learned this the hard way.<br><br>Your fake profile experiment sheds light on the truth - you lack the required social skills to (potentially) approach, qualify, and screen women you meet.  I<sq>m not a handsome guy.  I<sq>m 6<sq> 4<dq> with red hair and weigh 170 lbs.  I am a tall, thin, kid looking guy.  For years I was being used by women, paying their way, all that BS.  Then one day, when I was 32, I said to myself <dq>If I<sq>m so smart at my job, why can<sq>t I learn about women?<dq>  And that was the magic defining moment in my life.  I dove into self improvement and the results spoke for themselves.  You have to improve.  Women have spent decades learning about relationships, they have this shit down!  Now it<sq>s your turn.<br><br>In general, I am of the opinion that women are perfect the way they are.  They have a keen sense for finding a man that is suitable for them.  However, very few men ever learn to develop that same skill.  Many women will befriend you, which will only teach you how to act in a way that fosters friendships and not romantic and adult (think marriage) relationships.  Worse, some women will try to be with you purely for financial reasons instead of true compatibility.  (I know, it<sq>s shocking!)  Ultimately, both you and she will be unhappy.<br><br>So what is the solution?  It<sq>s simple.  Take some time and learn about dating and women.  Learn to be open and honest about what you want.  Ask women on dates, and use the word <dq>date<dq>!  (I never did, and never understood why women were surprised when I wanted to be more than just friends.)  Make a move and let women know you want an adult and sexual relationship.  Stop being <dq>friends<dq> with every woman you meet!  Understand how to screen out golddiggers.  Understand that when you date a woman, it is your #1 responsibility to determine if she is into you ... or into your wallet.  Then understand you have to find the woman who is really into you, and she is out there, if you are able to be good enough for her and get rid of the leeches that are in the way.<br><br>The easiest way for me to do that was the following<colon><br><br>* I bought a nondescript vehicle for dating.  It happened to by a mint condition 1992 GMC Typhoon, but I never met a woman who knew what it was, they all thought it was a little SUV.  I now drive a 2006 Mini Cooper.  If a woman you<sq>ve just met ever asks you what kind of car you drive, dump her.  <br><br>* All first dates were for <dq>a drink<dq> at a nearby quiet bar, and *I* was the one who set up the date - NEVER her.  The max I would spend on any of my first dates was $20.  Yes, just $20!  If a woman would suggest *anything else*, such as a movie, a dinner, a party, a club, wine tasting, or literally anything else, I would tell her that would not work and move on.  The point here is that a woman who is interested in you will GLADLY sit at a bar, have a drink, maybe get a little tipsy, and just *talk to you*.  A woman who is interested in your wallet will want something <dq>more<dq>.  Set the precedent from the start.  <br><br>* During that first date, my job was to see if SHE was good enough for ME.  Not the other way around.  Never the other way around.  You have to understand this.  **You are the prize**.  You<sq>re the guy with the job, you<sq>re the guy with the house, you are the guy with the money to provide.  You get to choose, not the other way around.  In fact, you have to LEARN how to choose.  If you don<sq>t, then they are picking, and you<sq>ll likely be unhappy.<br><br>* I would ask a few questions to find out about her.  It wasn<sq>t an interrogation, of course, but I<sq>d find out what she was into.  You need to know ... what does she bring to the table and how does it exactly match what you want/need, for the short AND long term?  How is she going to perfectly compliment your life?  Does she like the same music?  Movies?  Social events?  TV shows?  Sense of humor?  Food - steak, sushi, vegetarian, ice cream, whatever.  Sleep patterns (morning person like you or night owl)?  Energy levels?  Sports - backpacking, boating, skiing, snowboarding, biking ... what do you do, does she like it (I bike)?  Can she cook?  Do you even *want* her to cook?  (I can cook quite well, and I love it.)  And if you have kids, will she cook healthy stuff for them AND me?  Can she and will she clean if you get a house?  Or do you not care because you<sq>ll hire a cleaning service?  Is she frugal with money?  Is she a nice person?  Or does she always seem to be having a bad day?  Is she clinically sane?  Is she medically healthy?  Is she a caring and giving person?  Is the trustworthy, has integrity, and honest?  Is she good looking *and* can stay that way as she gets older?  Is her family nice?  Are her friends nice?  Is she a careful driver?  Does she live no more than 15 minutes away from you?  Does she have her own place?  A job?  A savings account?  Is she good in bed?  Is she free of STDs?  I mean ... everything you want, does she have it?  The whole point of dating is to find out this stuff.  You don<sq>t want to get ten years down the line and find out she refuses to cook for the kids!  You also want to be a little bit of a mystery, leave her wanting to know more about you.  You know, since you shut up and let her talk!  You should learn more about her on the first date than she does about you, and she should walk out thinking <dq>Hey, I didn<sq>t learn much about him at all!  We need to go out again!<dq><br><br>* If she doesn<sq>t meet your standards, it is your responsibility to *disqualify her* as fast as humanly possible.  You need to learn to flirt, tease, joke, and ask a few questions.  #1 is <dq>So, are you single?<dq>  If she says no, then either move on, or if you think she is flirting then you need to up the ante.  Frankly, with some practice, you should be able to talk to a woman for 5 minutes and determine if you even want to go on a date with her.  Five MINUTES.  Not 5 days, not 5 dates, not 5 months, and sure as hell not almost 5 years into a marriage like what happened to me with my ex-wife.<br><br>* Remember to distinguish *dating* behaviors from *marriage* behaviors.  When you are dating, it is NOT your job or desire to do everything in your power to <dq>fix<dq> it or <dq>save<dq> it when things are going wrong.  If lots of things are going wrong when you are dating, or you are not happy, understand that this is (possibly) an incompatibility, and you need to end the relationship.  This is NOT A MARRIAGE.  When you are married, because dating was super smooth and happy and fun, and *little things go wrong*, THAT is the time when you work on fixing it.  This is CRUCIAL to long term happiness.  <br><br>* You have to learn to look for red flags.  One woman I met seemed awesome.  I called her up to ask her on a date, but I really use that as an opportunity to pre-screen her.  I asked her where she lived, with the tie-in being I don<sq>t date women who live more than about 15 minutes away.  She replied <dq>Actually, I live in my ex-boyfriends mothers basement in ...<dq> and I didn<sq>t bother listening to the rest.  I told her that wouldn<sq>t work for me, and maybe I<sq>d see her around.  I didn<sq>t even ask her on a date.  I saved my $20 and hours of time on a woman who was talking about her ex and living with his mom!<br><br>* Date a woman for 1-2 years and understand that during that time period they will drop their act and be who they really are.  Be ready to have to dump a woman at 6 months, a year, or even two years.  She suddenly stops cooking?  Or doesn<sq>t want sex any more?  Says she wants to quit her job?  All red flags.  Those first two YEARS are when you need to be on your guard.  Harsh, but true.  <br><br>* Keep your <dq>fake job<dq> profile up, and work on improving it.  Go to /r/OkCupid and see what other people are doing.  Go buy books on flirting, dating, learning body language, how to be a better person, how to be ore friendly, make friends, be social, and all that stuff.  <br><br>* Now, **most importantly**, only take dating and relationship advice from men.  The biggest and most damaging thing I did to my social skills was to take advice from women.  If you ever ask women for advice, STOP NOW.  In fact, if a woman tells you some relationship advice, the opposite is almost always universally true *for men*.  Don<sq>t ask the fish how to catch fish, ask a fisherman.  On top of that, only ask men who are in your same situation for advice.  Don<sq>t go ask the best looking guy for dating advice.  He has no clue!  He just uses his looks!  Ask other wealthy men who learned to screen out women.  Ask other men who can actually tell you HOW it<sq>s done.  And READ more about dating tips that is written by men.  (Disclaimer<colon> I am not saying women cannot give good advice, but in general men give much better advice because we<sq>ve actually done it.)<br><br>* Avoid angry or aggressive women like the plague.<br><br>* Strive to be a gentle MAN, like Cary Grant.<br><br>* When she finds out what you do, and you decide to get married, get a prenup.  End of story.<br><br>Hope that helps!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I think (having been slut shamed a *lot* myself) that it<sq>s about reducing competition. If sex is scarce, then women have control over men. I<sq>ve been looking into a theory recently that I<sq>ve read about- why don<sq>t straight women want anything to do with bisexual men and why do they write off bi men as automatically being gay? (According to a [2012 Glamour poll,](http<colon>//www.glamour.com/sex-love-life/2012/10/would-you-date-a-bi-guy-glamour-magazine-november-2012) 36<percent> of straight women polled wouldn<sq>t date a bisexual man under any circumstances.) According to what I<sq>ve heard some men say, it<sq>s all about control. If more men were bi, then rather than having two guys competing for your attention in the bar, they could decide that doing backflips (buying drinks, whatever) for a stuck up bitch is too much trouble to be worth it and go home with each other instead. <br><br>It<sq>s not just about breeding/mating/continuing the species in our modern society. Have you ever had a girl squish her boobs together and bat her eyelashes at you to try to get you to do something for her? If you<sq>re getting laid all the time, you<sq>ll brush her off. If sex is scarce, maybe a guy is more likely to fall for it? (I can<sq>t speak for men since I<sq>m not one, but as a bisexual woman who has terrible luck with women, I fall for that shit more often than I<sq>d like <colon>/ so some men<sq>s input would be awesome) How about the fact that a lot of stores have female cashiers (looking at you, Best Buy) to convince straight male customers to buy more stuff? Or super sexual advertising (Hardees is one of the most egregious examples). If sex is easy to get, then men aren<sq>t as easy to <dq>control<dq> in that sense. <br><br>The reason for the <dq>scare quotes<dq> is that I don<sq>t want to say that you guys can be directly <dq>controlled<dq> by that shit- you<sq>re all smarter than that. But I can<sq>t help but think of observations from my asexual brother, and the times I was immature enough to try to use sexuality to get guys to do what I want. It makes me wonder what the origin of that is. Is it because women have historically had less power than men, so we policed each others<sq> sexuality so we could use sexuality with men as a bargaining chip to gain more social capital? I don<sq>t know- I<sq>m an engineer, not a sociologist. <br><br>I can say from my experience as an engineer though that when women/sex seem more scarce, men start to act a bit more weird (ok that<sq>s a huge understatement) about it. Going out of their way to do stuff for you, etc. And there are women that are more than happy to take advantage of that. If other women were happy to have sex with those guys without making them jump through hoops, the slut shamers would lose their <dq>power<dq> (or in this case, lose having some poor engineering student do all her calculus homework for the semester). But this is all conjecture. </p>",

We don<sq>t give a shit about lace accents, color, fabric, etc, that<sq>s supposed to be for you. You put it on, you feel sexy, and that in turn will turn us on. When we see you in bed, in your lingerie, we get turned on because we<sq>re seeing something naughty, something that you were wearing for you and making you feel sexy.<br>  <br>Your clothes should be the same way. It should reflect the best of your personality and make you feel sexy and confident. That<sq>s why a tshirt and jeans is just as sexy as a short dress, because the woman wearing it feels comfortable in her own skin, and radiates that to everyone around her.<br>  <br>So don<sq>t wear things to turn us on, wear things that turn you on and we<sq>ll be turned on in the process.</p>",

                "answer": "<p><br><br>Edit<colon> wow front page and /bestof. For those popping in and saying I am generalizing women. You are correct. I made very general statements about how it is to live with women, because no girl is the same as the others.  I was giving this young man the best advice I could give him to help him if he chooses to live with 3 20something women. I have had 11 women for roommates in my time. I had to make many mistakes, including sleeping with them and/or their friends to be able to get to this level of understanding.  Thanks for listening and contributing.  /edit. <br><br><br>I have lived with more girls than guys and infact was the lone guy in house of 3 girls like what you are facing.  Best time of my life!<br><br>Don<sq>t sleep with them, don<sq>t fall for them, don<sq>t like them, they are your sisters. <br><br>You will see a constant stream of guys coming around, get used to it.  You will be introduced as the roommate and the guys will be indifferent to you. Be friendly, but don<sq>t be a pushover. It<sq>s your house too. <br><br>Don<sq>t touch their laundry, and don<sq>t EVER put anything of theirs in to the dryer, dear god don<sq>t! <br><br>Don<sq>t bitch about the bathrooms and get used to hair being everywhere. <br><br>They will ask you if what they are wearing looks good, don<sq>t lie when it doesn<sq>t, just don<sq>t make them feel insecure about it.  Say something like <dq>I<sq>m not really feeling it, maybe with a different belt or accessory, maybe a different color shirt or pants<dq><br><br>You will get in fights, you will be the ref, you will be forced to take sides (don<sq>t, and be adamant about it). Listen to them when they are upset, don<sq>t try to force an opinion on them or fix their problem. Just listen and ask open ended questions that will keep them talking.  <br><br>Don<sq>t tell them anything you don<sq>t want another to know, they will talk, they will all know. <br><br>Sounds like a pain in the ass right? It is. However, they will be the best wingmen you will ever have and the best roommates. <br><br>DO NOT SLEEP WITH ANY OF THEM OR THEIR FRIENDS!! (Edit<colon> go ahead and see where it gets you when you bring over a girl you are interested in having as a gf. This girl will ask your roommates about you and they won<sq>t be shy if you hurt them or one of their friends)<br><br><br>Edit<colon> so a lot of guys are saying this is <dq>beta<dq>. There<sq>s nothing beta about living peacefully with your roommates. You don<sq>t try to alpha three females you live with.  3v1 is never a good situation, especially if you are a young man.   <br><br>Having sex with your roommates can and will cause issues unless there is mutual feelings other than just physical attraction. It<sq>s not always gonna wreck it, but the chances are very high. Just sleeping with them to get laid is a bad idea and will cause more harm than it<sq>s worth.  Sleeping with their close friends in the same capacity will also cause more problems than it<sq>s worth.  <br><br>By keeping their friends out of it as well builds a level of trust and respect.  I did this and I would never have to do any work to pick up a girl, my roommates would do it all and I would get laid on a weekly basis by new girls because of them.  Why fuck up your home life when you have 3 great wing women knowing you just wanna get laid. <br><br>I will clarify the bathroom thing. What I meant about not bitching about the bathroom is that 3 girls using a bathroom will be a nightmare for a guy, you can<sq>t expect it to be perfect and bitching about it on the regular is only going to cause problems. If it<sq>s out of hand, then yes by all means, but seeing their products about and taking up counter and cabinet space is going to always be an on going thing, bitching about it isn<sq>t goin to get him anywhere but the doghouse. You do not want to be in the doghouse with 3 female roommates. <br><br>Edit 2<colon>  To the guys who think this letting your get walked on, or I need a bigger set of balls or anything along these lines, you need to realize a couple things. <br><br>1)  you have obviously never lived with multiple women in their 20<sq>s. <br><br>2) knowing what battles to fight is the key to a happy life. Women don<sq>t act like men when they are pissed off at you. There<sq>s no getting in a fight and being a bro the next day. There<sq>s no <dq>I<sq>m a man, I make the rules<dq>, that gets you shit on and cockblocked very fast.  <br><br>3) keeping your female roommates happy with you gets you laid more often than you would if you try to be dominant.   If it<sq>s just one girl, stand your ground, especially if your reasoning is sound. Your logic is different than their logic. Married men and men with GF<sq>s can attest to this.  If you are living with multiple women, you are the minority, you WILL lose, don<sq>t waste your time or energy fighting a losing battle. <br><br>4) They spend more time in the bathroom than you will, and it should only take you 10mins to get ready in the morning. An average girl takes an hour or more, so when you multiply that by 3, you really stop caring as long as you get in and get it done.  <br><br>5) you<sq>re selfish sexist idiots who think that being this way makes you less of a man.  It doesn<sq>t. It makes you a better man. Women have different needs than us and they are more sensitive than we are.  Learn this and you will be happier and have stronger relationships. <br><br>6) 1 man cannot dominate a house of 3 women. It<sq>s impossible. If they think badly of you, you will have a bad time.  Your bros can<sq>t save you from the hell they can bring you. <br><br>Last, but definitely not least)  I, in no way, said to let these girls walk over you, I gave advice to allow him to live in this situation and be a happy, constantly laid, man. <br><br>Ninja edit for the ladies reading this<colon> I bring up the getting laid part a lot as this is what the majority if men in their 20<sq>s want to do. I<sq>m not encouraging being a slut, jerk, douchebag, or anything like that. This is a sub for men and it<sq>s the male answer. </p>",

I<sq>m in a 10-year-old relationship with a very active women where I am very calm guy that is very introverted and needs a lot of time alone. I will try to write you a quick <dq>manual<dq>, just give me 20 min or so. Also feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions. BRB with extended version.<br><br>EDIT<colon><br><br>First of all, and this is crucial, establish with your SO that this is this kind of relationship, and that you both have your needs. Try to both express to eatchother your needs, what you want to do for fun, what you want to do to chill together, what you want to do when you want to be alone.<br><br>In that conversation you both have to accept your differences and feel comfortable with the needs of the other party. He probably needs some time alone to <dq>recharge<dq> his batteries. If you live together, in time, he will become comfortable with regenerating with you around. If you<sq>re living apart you have to give him space where he<sq>s not answering phone, not responding to texts and where you not pressure him with those. On the other side he has to acknowledge your needs to keep active, to stay in touch and keep conversation going.<br><br>It<sq>s a delicate balance, that will probably be more daunting on you. He<sq>s used to people bothering him and breaching his <dq>personal bubble<dq> and the default response is to cut them off. Your both job is to make you welcome in that bubble in a way where he<sq>s comfortable with you and you feeling comfortable within it.<br><br>There<sq>s a lot of reaching out on both parts if it<sq>s to work in a long run. However hard it is for him, he has to gather the energy to go out, meet new people, engage in your endeavours. On the other hand you have to be able to smoothly integrate into his world, when he<sq>s <dq>alone<dq>. In our case we played video games together, because I love games. I read to her my childhood books when she was falling asleep, because I love reading. We cook together because we both love delicious, foreign food. Create your own little adventures, where you are the only two heroes.<br><br>When you plan your time together, remember that anyone but you may be a strain for him. Friends are ok, but hanging out around them is tiring and requires some silence afterward. From him; and that may be a VERY hard lesson; he needs to learn to let you go, experience world on your own. But remember, trust is the key, once you loose it, it<sq>s near impossible to recover. But if your intentions are pure, in time, he will begin to feel comfortable with you exploring world and bringing results into his bubble.<br><br>Speaking of silence. Learn the beauty of it. We, introverts, love being quiet. Try sitting on a bench, just enjoying the air, wind, smells... no words necessary. Or eat a meal at a food court without a word. It<sq>s not awkward, if you try it it<sq>s really not. You can experience the sound of surroundings, communicate just by smiles and eye expressions. It really builds a connection when you don<sq>t have to verbally comment on everything.<br><br>It<sq>s a difficult road but very fulfilling if you<sq>re able to find that equilibrium. You both will grow and experience new stuff, and belive me... love blossoms at the edge of silence and shouts.<br><br>EDIT<colon> My first gold. Thank you.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>EDIT<colon> This has become quite popular, so I feel I should clarify a few things.<br><br>1. I wrote this all off the top of my head. Of course there are cologne options that I missed. This is just a *general* idea to get you started. There are literally thousands of colognes that are worthy, but I don<sq>t have time to list more than a few.<br><br>2. Different guys are going to like different smells. You aren<sq>t wrong just because you like something that other people don<sq>t. However, keep in mind the *reason* that you<sq>re wearing cologne. If it<sq>s to impress women, you should probably pick scents that are going to appeal to women.<br><br>3. I<sq>ve edited my post to be more of a guide and less of a comment. My personal cologne collection is at the bottom. This is my *personal* tastes in colognes. I don<sq>t care if certain fragrance enthusiasts think they<sq>re banal or basic. They smell good and appeal to women in my experience. <br><br>4. PM me your questions, if you<sq>d like. I will answer every PM. EDIT<colon> I<sq>ve hundreds of PMs, I<sq>m trying to get to them all.

More expensive colognes and brands don<sq>t mean anything, other than the fact that they tend to have way more money to throw and research, demographics, and marketing. Scents for these companies are major business investments, and they tend to make stuff that will make them money. I<sq>m not saying you need to buy name brands.<br><br>7. I<sq>M NOT AN EXPERT. I WORK AT A DEPARTMENT STORE. This isn<sq>t <dq>KCAMRN<sq>S DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO BEING A FUCKING MAN AND EVERY COLOGNE YOU SHOULD WEAR OR YOU<sq>RE WRONG<dq>. It<sq>s just some helpful suggestions and my opinions based on my customer interactions.<br><br><br>8. I spray my cologne on my chest. One long spray across the chest for a normal day, and one spray on both sides of my chest if I want to smell stronger. I don<sq>t spray cologne on my bare skin because it<sq>s a bit sensitive. Any more than a couple sprays and you<sq>re going to smell like you bathed in it. The trick is to give yourself a good and subtle scent that will make people feel invited to be closer to you.<br><br><br>***MY ACTUAL COMMENT***<br><br><br>I work in a department store and sell fragrance pretty regularly. The three colognes you listed are solid, however they aren<sq>t the same type of smells and I would use each of those for a different occasion. <br><br>Cologne is more complicated than you might think. There are certain colognes that smell better on men of different ethnicity, and some that pair better with a season or time of day. Darker and muskier colognes are better for evening wear, in my opinion. Lighter and and flowery/citrusy colognes are best for day. Your age plays a big role in what colognes are best for you. There<sq>s a reason Old Spice smells like your great-grandpa and Polo Black smells like your grandpa with money. <br><br>**HIGH SCHOOL**<br><br>You probably don<sq>t need to be throwing much money at high-end colognes at this point in your life. Most of the females around you are going to enjoy sweeter musky smells, which is why Abercrombie Fierce, Curve, and Pac Sun colognes are popular. The problem with these scents is that they<sq>re usually weak in fragrant oils, so they don<sq>t last long. After high school, it<sq>s time to toss that stuff in the garbage and move on to some better smells.<br><br>**COLLEGE**<br><br>It<sq>s university time, bitches. If you<sq>re college age, stay away from some of the <dq>classics<dq>, such as *most* Polo colors, Drakaar Noir, Cool Water, etc. If you remember your dad using it when you were little, steer clear of it. Don<sq>t argue with me on this. You will smell like shit, and younger women won<sq>t like it. Go for names like Lacoste, Diesel (Only the Brave), Versace, Gucci, Calvin Klein (Euphoria is great), Kenneth Cole (Mankind is their newest and best, IMO), Dior, etc. *Names you probably recognize and would probably wear clothing from.* These brands have insane amounts of money, and typically end up producing some really great smelling fragrances. Even if you don<sq>t particularly like Diesel, they<sq>re going to have a lot of money to make something that appeals to the nose. There are plenty of other good ones too, just naming some off the top of my head that are popular among men, and very popular with women. Mont Blanc Legend is also a great cologne, as others have pointed out.<br><br>The reason I dislike some of the <dq>classic<dq> colognes for this age group is because they came from a different time when certain smells were popular. They usually end up being too sharp on the nose for younger females, heavy with tobacco, leather, and bitter wood scents, and not really practical for daily use. That, and it will remind most girls of their dads, which is not a good thing. Scent is powerful. Use it to your advantage.<br><br>If you<sq>re looking for a good, versatile, everyday cologne that can be worn both day and night, I recommend Aqua De Gio. Marketing aside, there<sq>s a reason it<sq>s so popular. It<sq>s citrusy but still warm and masculine, making it good for year-round wear. It smells good no matter what you<sq>re wearing or what time of day it is. Incredibly versatile fragrance that can be worn by young college guys and it can carry you clear into your forties. Armani Code is also a huge seller, and I recommend this for evening events or formal wear. It<sq>s darker but very smooth with hints of vanilla and cedar. In my opinion, you can<sq>t go wrong as a man by having Aqua De Gio and Armani Code. Both of those colognes will make you smell great to the majority of women, and they tend to have a higher concentration of fragrant oils, which means the cologne will last longer without fading away. This is important when you<sq>re spending good money on a fragrance.<br><br>Gucci is spicy and darker, which tends to be their thing with colognes. Black pepper comes to mind when I smell Gucci stuff. I would wear it if I were throwing on a suit, or going out for dinner in a nice restaurant. I probably wouldn<sq>t wear Gucci during the day or to the office or something, simply because it<sq>s bold and strong. Get this if you don<sq>t wear cologne often, only for special occasions. They<sq>re trying hard to appeal to the guy in his thirties who<sq>s a little classier and dresses up more. <br><br>Don<sq>t buy Chrome. I don<sq>t recommend it. I haven<sq>t had a woman under forty that hasn<sq>t wrinkled her nose at the smell.  I<sq>ve been getting a lot of the <dq>women say they like it<dq> argument when it comes to their cologne of choice. That<sq>s totally fine. I<sq>m glad that the women in your life like the smell of whatever cologne you<sq>re wearing. My opinion is this<colon> there aren<sq>t a whole lot of colognes that are absolutely foul and offensive smelling. Sure, your girlfriend might say she likes Chrome. But has she ever smelled anything else on you to compare it to? Are you sure she isn<sq>t just fucking happy you don<sq>t smell like BO and pasta sauce like you usually do?<br><br>I also recommend Clinique Happy for Men to guys that don<sq>t like strong smells or most colognes. It<sq>s light, very citrusy, and makes you fucking happy when you wear it. <br><br>**MY COLOGNES**<br><br>I have a few, which I alternate between. Use this as a guide or a starting point if everything seems overwhelming.<br><br>***Light, citrus. Daytime and everyday use, year-round***<br><br>1. Lacose Essential. Really solid cologne choice, especially if you<sq>re just getting into colognes. It<sq>s got a slightly woodsy smell, but it<sq>s not pungent or overpowering. Very smooth and women tend to like it. Versatile enough to wear at all times of the day due to the darker undertones. This cologne is really Essential.<br><br>2. Clinique Happy. For those days that you don<sq>t want to smell like cologne, but you want to smell pleasant. Very citrusy and smooth, so you don<sq>t smell like cleaning supplies. <br><br>3. Dior Homme Sport. This cologne isn<sq>t light and citrusy, but it<sq>s not dark or really warm. Very spicy but still light and bright. I wear this during the day when I need to impress or dress up. Great, versatile cologne. I highly recommend it if you have a little more money to spend.<br><br><br>***Warm, mellow. Daytime/evening use, nicer clothing, fall***<br><br>1. Calvin Klein Euphoria. Great warm smell, slightly woodsy and romantic smelling. I wear this when I know a woman is going to be close to me, as it<sq>s not strong enough to really smell from a few feet away. It<sq>s definitely one of my favorites.<br><br>2. Kenneth Cole Mankind. The best scent this company has ever put out, in my opinion. It<sq>s manly smelling, but appeals to women. I highly recommend this as a starting place if you<sq>re looking for something darker.<br><br>3. Armani Code. Great cologne, like I described above. Smooth and velvety, pairs great with suits. It<sq>s my go-to suit cologne.<br><br>***Dark, sweet, musky, woodsy. Used for dates, nights out, or suits. Fall and winter, or special nights out during summer***<br><br>1. Diesel Only the Brave. Women go nuts for this cologne, and I use it when I really want to grab their attention. However, it<sq>s a young man<sq>s cologne, and if you<sq>re over thirty something else would probably be a better choice. The reason for that is the sweetness, which is very present on the nose. It<sq>s woodsy, but sweet. One of my favorites, and women usually get that wide-eyed look when they just meet you and get a whiff. It<sq>s a strong cologne, so use sparingly. <br><br>2. Gucci (dark bottle). A nice change if I<sq>m getting tired of my other scents. Black pepper comes to mind with this cologne. In my opinion, this is not a *seductive* cologne that will make women swoon. It<sq>s more manly/power cologne. I use it when meeting clients, giving presentations, and anywhere where the male presence is strong.<br><br>Note that you don<sq>t need all of this shit. Two colognes should suffice for your needs.</p>",

She<sq>d shown up one night out of the blue at the comic shop where I played Friday Night Magic<colon> The Gathering (Nerdy, right?).  I<sq>d talked to her for a couple of weeks, and we<sq>d played some Magic.  Finally, I screw up the courage to ask her out between rounds.  Before she can answer, pairings were posted for the third round of the tournament.  We were playing each other.  She tells me that her answer would depend on the outcome of the match.  I knew for a fact that my deck would beat hers.  I took a deep breath, and played it straight, deciding not to insult her intelligence by throwing the match.  She teases me for the rest of the night, but eventually agrees to the date.<br><br>We go out to a local restaurant.  The evening goes well; conversation is brisk and chipper, the food is great, and the atmosphere rather romantic.  As I<sq>m getting the bill, she leans over the table, bats her eyes at me, and says, <dq>So... you wanna come over to my place tonight?<dq>  My heart froze.

Yes, I would.<dq>  We spent the night cuddling while Luke blew up the Death Star, and I literally staggered back to my dorm that night--it was then that I knew that I<sq>d never fall for another girl again.

We have fun together, and give ourselves room and permission to be apart when we need to.  She makes me laugh like a madman, and takes my awful puns and maniacal ideas and turns them back on me whenever she can.  We play D&D together.  We make pointless romantic gestures to each other whenever we can.  We respect each other, and help without hesitation when the other needs it, no matter what.  Every day, I fall in love with her all over again, and each day is better than the last, because I don<sq>t just love her, I trust her, I like her, I<sq>m impressed by her, and I<sq>m inspired by her--and she says the same about me.<br><br>If it were just love, we probably would<sq>ve parted company long ago.

It<sq>s good to be comfortable with each other and have good communication. You want her to be able to say, <dq>Uh, that<sq>s not working, maybe a little to the left.<dq> One good tip ... go slow. Slower. Sloooower. Don<sq>t just dive in and start lapping away. Girls take longer to warm up than guys. I had a girlfriend who taught me to start by taking her feet in my lap and slowly stroking her legs with my fingertips, avoiding direct contact until she started to relax and take those deep, easy breaths. We sometimes started the fun with a glass of wine and a foot massage. With the torture devices called women<sq>s shoes, that<sq>s always welcome. I listen very carefully to my partner<sq>s breathing. You can usually hear a little catch in her breath when you do something right. Lightly kissing up her inner thighs seems to help. Then after 15 or 20 minutes she<sq>s usually eager to move things along. I guess I<sq>ve been lucky because I<sq>ve never met a pussy that didn<sq>t smell and taste amazing! And I<sq>ve never had a problem with pubes. I just keep exploring until I find the buried treasure. I like to lick slowly and lightly at first, avoiding contact with her clitoris until later. Some girls seem to really enjoy a deep tongue-fucking, but others are <sq>meh.<sq> At least it<sq>s worth a try. Finding the clitoris is usually easy. Just start at her opening and lick upwards slowly until you hit a bump that draws a gasp, or slight jerk of the hips. Then, maybe circle it with your tongue or stroke it lightly. Some girls are more sensitive than others and some don<sq>t even like direct contact, but prefer you to lick around the clit with occasional contact. Some girls like a finger or two inside while your tongue is at work, and some don<sq>t care. Ask once in awhile if you<sq>re on the right track, especially if she<sq>s not responding. When I start to concentrate on the clit, I keep my strokes very light, but very regular. You want to send a steady stream of signals to her pleasure center so that each one builds on the one before. I like to make occasional eye contact while dining, plus her facial expression can tell you a lot. Sometimes you get a quick explosion, sometimes it takes a lot longer. But when she goes over the top, be ready to hold on. Don<sq>t stop licking when she starts convulsing, but keep going until she<sq>s over the mountain and starting down the other side. Then beware of how super-sensitive she can be afterwards. And finally, a good long cuddle with kissing feels great.  <br><br>EDIT<colon> **WOW!** Thanks for all the kind responses here.

All your lube is gone.<br><br>One of the most erotic and sensual ways to kiss is with a trickle of water going on. Wet, juicy, hard core, porno kisses with nothing to clean up. No worries about saliva. You can fucking go to town and kiss in a way that you never thought possible. Two totally wet faces going at it... get ready for the most extreme level of kissing you<sq>ve ever known. You can rub faces as well, which is something that would never work dry, but if done just right, is also amazing.<br><br>There<sq>s no good way to explain what rubbing faces together means, however just go for a few 2-3 inch rubs between slippery kisses and you<sq>ll figure it out for yourself pretty quickly.<br><br>Her entire body, made slippery, soaped up. You can touch that in so many fun ways that you<sq>d never do dry.<br><br>When it<sq>s shower time, I get in a full body rub as well. My all, against her all. It starts as a hug, then I just start enjoying the slippage and working it. Sweet jesus, slippery hugs that move in any of four directions. It<sq>s hot.<br><br>The thing about being in a shower is that if you test the limits of what<sq>s possible, if you do things that you normally wouldn<sq>t think of doing, you<sq>ll find things that you really enjoy. You<sq>ll discover new moves that you both like.<br><br>Hookups in the shower? Fuck yes. Give me just a few minutes with any woman in a shower and she<sq>ll think I<sq>m a sexual god without even having sex yet. She<sq>ll get wet, and stay that way until we make it into the bed. She<sq>ll want me more than she<sq>s wanted anyone else, ever, regardless of what tricks or techniques he used, or what he looked like.<br><br>I.e. playing around in the shower is one of the most foolproof ways to turn someone on.<br><br>Back to things you might not think of doing outside the shower.. Eat our her armpits, do tongue play that goes for feet instead of just inches. Hairy armpits are no problem in the shower. Eat our her palms. (All those tantric hot spots that are kinda gross out of the shower become fair play.)<br><br>Tldr; Get your ass in the shower and discover a whole world of moves and techniques that either work better, aren<sq>t gross anymore, or wouldn<sq>t work anywhere else.

If either one of you is not putting forth their best effort to have sex then you have a big problem on your hands. 9/10 times it has nothing to do with the act itself, it could be work related stress, it could be you arent being the person who you were when she feel for you, it could be that another person is distracting her. Your job is to make sure you are furfilling her emotional needs first, without that you will never be able to really seduce her. When it comes down to the seducing thing if you are married there should have been plenty of times she has mentioned things you do that turn her on. It can range from sweating while working on something in the house, fixing or building things. It can be something as simple as putting on a belt or walking around in a wife beater. Gentlemen do your homework and always pay attention when a woman talks because when she stops talking It may be too late. </p>",

There are lots of jokes, memes, songs, and pop culture humor about the country and the Kim dynasty. <br><br>However, the reality of the country is no joke. NK has arguably the world<sq>s worst human rights record, with people and their whole families being put into prison camps, where horrifying torture and biological experimentation occur. One first hand account of reality in these camps was published in a book called *Aquariums of Pyongang*, written by Kang Chol-Hwan, a North Korean defector who was imprisoned in one of them. In fact, the country as a whole might as well be called one big concentration camp. People get imprisoned for things such as insulting the Kim dynasty to even owning South Korean movies (which are often smuggled in along with other goods from SK and especially China). There is also endless propaganda and brainwashing about the regime through billboards, TV programs, speeches, and statues. The Kim dynasty has a cult of personality that could put Stalin to shame. <br><br>Meanwhile, the regime deliberately starves its people, and a major famine in the 1990s killed perhaps over 1 million people. There have been anecdotes of people resorting to desperate measures to get food, such as getting grass from hillsides. The country also utterly lacks electricity [compared to its neighbors](https<colon>//encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn<colon>ANd9GcSbcQ1aSZNYm_wRyZYleFu79w_TCOYY6LioqWmSpl5JTPqovMtMEt-tbvKD). My personal experience with this was when I once went to the Chinese city of Dandong, which is on the Yalu river, separating it from NK. The NK city of Sinuiju can be easily seen, especially a strange ferris wheel that dominates the view. However, at night, the contrast is painfully evident<colon> Dandong has several highrises and a waterfront which are all lit up, while Sinuiju is pretty much pitch dark (with only a dim light here and there). <br><br>North Korea is pretty much the best real-life example of the society described in George Orwell<sq>s *1984*.

Worry about seasoning later, we need to get the mechanics of it right first.<br><br>**Rules**<br><br>**1.** Don<sq>t buy poor quality beef. Anything with higher than 20<percent> fat is going to be difficult to manage and create grease flame-ups that produce uneven cooking. I prefer 85/15 for a good flavor but stays together, don<sq>t go leaner than 15<percent> or they will be dry and crumble.<br><br>**2.** Prep temperature matters. Do not freeze the beef, make your patties while the meat is cold. I like to pop mine back into the fridge overnight or into the freezer for a half hour to set the fat in place. This helps them stay together.<br><br>**3.** Form is function. You want your patties to have a small divot in the middle to account for the beef shrinking. When it cooks the fat melting will pull the patty into itself swelling the middle, a divot in the center will make sure your burger is a uniform size when completely cooked. Basically you want the outside of the raw patty to be about 10<percent> thicker than the middle.<br><br>**4.** Prep your cook surface. Scrub the grate down with a wire brush and get all muck off of it. Dirty grills stick, right before you put the burgers on, wet a rag with some veggie oil and use tongs to rub it along the grates for a perfect cooking surface.<br><br>**5.** Leave it alone. You should only flip your burger once, and do not scoot it around on the grill. Plan your placement of each patty, account for at least one inch between each for even heat around the edges. Look for browning of about 30<percent> of the patty and a good char before you flip, excessive flipping loses moisture and makes hockey pucks. *Edit<colon> Never smash it with a spatula, you squeeze all the juice out. Exception is for a griddle press but we<sq>re grilling here.*<br><br>**6.** Let them rest. As with all cooked meat, let the burgers rest on a plate for a few minutes to allow the beef to relax and reabsorb moisture. The burger will also continue to cook with residual heat it retained from the grill.<br><br>**Misc tips**<br><br>If a burger is getting a little loose while cooking, throw a cheese slice on that bad boy to glue it back together. <br><br>Keep a spray bottle full of water to shoot any grease flare ups, helps even cooking and keeps hair on your arms. *Edit<colon> THIS IS FOR GRILLING ONLY! DON<sq>T DO THIS INSIDE, YOU WILL SET ALL OF YOUR SHIT ON FIRE*<br><br>*Hope this helps, practice makes perfect!*<br><br></p>",

I was an only child from divorced parents, and I spent a lot of time alone. Didn<sq>t have many friends. So I loved that cat more than anything--it was like a sibling to me. Slept on my bed, shared my successes and defeats, etc. That cat was always there for me.<br><br>When I was in maybe sixth grade, I had a crush on this girl named Emily. Everyone had a crush on Emily because she had boobs when nobody else did. She was one of those girls who dated everyone, you know, not really <dq>dated<dq> but was like a diva that was always flitting around between boys, twirling her blonde hair, fluttering her eyelashes, etc. Her mom was really into the beauty pageant circuit too, so she knew more about manipulating men than any girl that age should. She made the boys cry a lot. She seemed to revel in shattering innocence.<br><br>Well one day she starts fluttering her eyelashes in my direction. I<sq>m confused as fuck because I<sq>m just some socially awkward only-child who<sq>s never, ever been part of the popular circle of kids who<sq>re always swapping boyfriends and girlfriends. Why<sq>s she looking at me all of a sudden? I kind of just sit there and take it, stunned. She giggles. Seems to like it. Holds my hand at recess. Sits with me at lunch. This goes on for a week or so. The entire time I<sq>m in a daze. What is happening to me?<br><br>Childhood romance is a warzone more brutal than any other. The other girls start to notice that Emily<sq>s sunk her claws into me and now they start moving in, too, thinking I<sq>m the hot new thing, thinking that maybe they can steal me away and score some popular points. So now the socially-awkward weirdo is constantly surrounded by popular girls, which is really strange for me, since all I want to do is go off alone and hide under the football bleachers and play Pokemon Red on the Game Boy Color I got for Christmas, but now I can<sq>t anymore because I<sq>ve got this pack of wolves following me around, pulling my hair, fighting over who gets to hold my hand, etc, with Emily being the most aggressive, like a lion trying to chase 12 hyenas away from a zebra carcass, and me being the carcass, just sitting there, doing nothing, stiff and ambivalent.<br><br>Eventually Emily decides it<sq>s time to go nuclear. She finds out that my mom works late at night (no dad, remember, divorced parents) and tells me that she<sq>s going to come home with me tomorrow and we<sq>re going to sleep together. I don<sq>t even know what this means<colon> this was before smart phones, back when kids didn<sq>t have Urban Dictionary to tell them what a Cleveland Steamer was, back when kids were kids, you know, so when she says sleep with me, I kind of know it<sq>s something serious, but I don<sq>t really know what it is. I shrug. Whatever. All I<sq>m thinking is, sweet, maybe she<sq>ll play Pokemon cards with me when we<sq>re done.<br><br>So we get home and pulls up her shirt and suddenly I realize I do NOT want ANYTHING to do with this (sixth grade, dude, I hadn<sq>t even hit puberty yet) and start saying, woah, no, no, please, let<sq>s just play Pokemon cards, please. But she<sq>s getting very aggressive, calling me names, telling me I<sq>m garbage, that I<sq>m a loser, that I don<sq>t deserve this, that I should be happy I<sq>m getting anything since nobody likes me, just trying her hardest to break me and humiliate me into doing whatever she wants. But no.

I was already broken and that just broke me more. I screamed and pleaded with her but she just smiled, flipped out the top lever of the nail clippers, you know, the thing you press on to make the blade come together, and with that little handle thing she gouged out Sugaree<sq>s left eye.<br><br>I honestly don<sq>t remember much after that. Sugaree freaked the fuck out, like you<sq>d expect, and Emily dropped her, because, you know, nobody can hold a cat when it<sq>s in batshit mode unless they<sq>re wearing kevlar... Emily leaves, I don<sq>t remember if she said anything or what, I think she probably just booked it... I end up going to my neighbor<sq>s house with Sugaree, the neighbor freaks out, predictably, and takes me to the vet, and they end up removing the eye, but all in all Sugaree is fine, you know, it<sq>s just an eye, they<sq>re nice but you don<sq>t *really* need them...<br><br>It was a long time ago but I guess nobody ever asked me how it happened because Emily did not get in trouble. She never talked to me again and when people realized Emily wasn<sq>t interested in me anymore all the other girls left me alone, too, and I was much happier for it in the long run because I<sq>ve always been a loner and at this point in my life I<sq>ve accepted it and embraced it and who knows how many Emilys I<sq>ve avoided by staying inside on Reddit rather than going out and having a social life.<br><br>Sugaree died about six years ago. Had her cremated. I<sq>m looking at her ashes right now. They<sq>re on my desk in a little tin box decorated, inexplicably, with dog paw prints. I<sq>ve never gotten another cat. The joke I say is that Sugaree ruined all other cats for me. Saying that out loud, I realize how sad that sounds. Thanks for reading.</p>",

Except for my girlfriend at the time. <br><br>So I spent nearly every single day with the ball & chain. Getting high, cuddling, and sexing and stuff. There was lots of kissing. Everytime one of us made the other laugh. Kissy kissy. Everytime one of us comforted the other. Kissy Kissy. It basically became muscle memory to go in for a kiss everytime we had an interaction of any sort. <br><br>This goes on for the duration of the grounding. Then I got ungrounded near the end of summer! First thing I did was call up one of my best friends. We shall call him Reginald. <br><br>Reggie came over to my house with a dickload of Shrooms. so naturally we ate all of them. We rolled around alot. Laughed. A few hours into the trip we decided to go on a walk around the hood. <br><br>At one point during our psychedelic walk and talk through the hood I said something pretty funny. Both of us laugh. Out of muscle memory I close my eyes and go in for kiss. and so does he... We stop at the last second. I immediately explain to him how embarrassed I am and how I had only been hanging out with my ball & chain lately blah blah blah. <br><br>Reggie just smiled and said <dq>it<sq>s ok man<dq> <dq>I understand<dq>.<br><br>Later on in life.

I continue to be excited about the opportunity to work with you and to help [the company] grow to its full potential.  As I mentioned in our last conversation, I truly believe that I am an ideal fit for [the company] in this role.  The position offers all the aspects I<sq>m looking for from the day-to-day responsibility for financial reporting to the upper management roles of driving profitability, strategic management and business analysis.<br><br>Based upon the time I have spent with you, I believe that the keys to success for [the company] are to analyze and accurately project future cash flow, while also identifying and analyzing the costs of each specific job order.  With accurate information about both cash needs and project profitability, as a management team we will be able to make business decisions in the best interest of the Company and its investors.  This is very similar to the situation I was faced with when I joined [my previous employer] 5 years ago.  By providing accurate financial information on a product and customer basis, we were able to make proper business decisions which led that company to strong profitability after a decade of losses.  Based upon that experience, I believe I can duplicate that success at [the company].<br><br>However, the salary and benefits package provided for in the offer letter were significantly lower than what I was anticipating and desiring and I do not feel it reflects this value that I would bring to the Company.  As we discussed during the interview process, I am flexible with my salary requirements and do not necessarily need to replace the base salary of $113,000 that I was making in my previous position.  However, I was hoping to stay as close to that range as possible and anticipating a decrease closer to 5<percent>, rather than the 20<percent> represented by the $90,000 in the offer.  <br><br>To make certain that I wasn<sq>t being unreasonable with my expectations, I consulted the Salary Guide for Accounting and Finance Professionals published by Accounting Principles.  As you can see from the extract below, my expectations are significantly below the $129,000 average [position] salary for small companies.<br><br>[Salary Guide Extract with Markups.JPG]<br><br>I know, name, that this leaves us with a pretty big gap between the offer and what I<sq>m looking for.  I don<sq>t know how much flexibility you have to increase the offer closer to the $107,000 - $110,000 range, but I believe that is a reasonable salary for the position and would adequately reflect my skills, experience and the value that I will bring to the Company.  I truly believe that adding me as an additional strong and experienced leader on your management team would lead to the financial success that you and the investors are looking for at [the company].<br><br>I wanted to respond in writing to give you an opportunity to fully absorb and contemplate the information provided.  Please let me know your thoughts and if you would like to discuss any possible alternatives in more detail, please call me.  I<sq>d also be happy to meet with you again if you feel that would be more productive.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>*A couple keys in this negotiation were that (a) the offer was coming from a company that I knew was struggling financially, so I wasn<sq>t sure they<sq>d be able to afford my demands and (b) I had confidence that I could probably find a different job that paid more, and at worst could find another job that would pay me $90,000, if this one didn<sq>t work out.  So even if they had told me that $90,000 was the best they could do, I would have been fine with rejecting the offer and continuing my search.*</p>",

I have several bad ones but here<sq>s probably my biggest fuck up (yet somehow ended up ok)<colon><br><br>My roommate and his girlfriend were playing matchmaker and trying to hook me up with this girl. She lived about an hour away. We texted and emailed for about two weeks before we met. Texts got pretty explicit and it was obvious we had some chemistry. For our first date we decided I would take her to our city<sq>s annual music festival and she would spend the night. <br><br>So the night comes, and she comes over. I was nervous as shit and chain smoking. She<sq>s not a smoker. Oops. First big mistake. <br><br>We pregame a little and then hop in my car and drive downtown for the festival. My intent was that we would check out a couple bands together and just have a good time. Well the thing is, back then, I was somewhat of a local celebrity especially within the type of people that would be at this festival. People were constantly wanting to come up and talk to me and I was too polite/not assertive enough to turn them away. So my date felt abandoned (and rightly so). <br><br>It got worse when I was asked impromptu to go up on stage and introduce a band. She said it was fine but I should have known better. She ended up finding a friend of hers (male) in the crowd and talking to him while I was acting like Mr. Bigshot. <br><br>When I found her she was making plans to have her friend take her home. I apologized profusely for being an insensitive ass and offered to take her back to her car. It was late and I offered to let her stay the night with no sexual intentions so she didn<sq>t have to drive back home. She decided she wanted me to drive her to her car and that she was driving home. She was seething mad, but didn<sq>t talk about it. <br><br>Ok, no problem. So we walk back to my car. During that walk something happened I guess. I quit thinking like Mr. Bigshot and started paying attention to her. She cooled off during the walk. And on the drive back to my house we started talking and having a real conversation. We ended up going into the house and sitting on the sofa and talking more. She said her feet hurt, so I rubbed them. <br><br>When she tells the story that<sq>s the point she says things turned around. She hated me until I rubbed her feet - she says that melted her. <br><br>Anyway she ended up spending the night. Fast forwarding - we got married, had a baby, got divorced. <br><br>But it was a roller coaster of a first date I really fucked up yet somehow managed to save. </p>",

I like it not because I<sq>m conquering or imposing myself on my girlfriend, but because during sex I get to share intimacy and enjoyment with a woman I care deeply about and love more than anything in the world. She means so much to me- sex is not something I do *to* her, but something we do together.<br><br>We<sq>re not super-strong, sex-crazed monsters. We<sq>re people, just like you <colon>) We have thoughts and feelings and human hearts. We experience love, compassion, motivation and joy. Sex is passion and love for us too, not just insane vengeful lust.<br><br>There are dangerous men out there, just like there are dangerous women. We feel the same way about those men as you do. We hate rapists. They make us furious. We hate what they do to hurt the women we love- our sisters and wives, our mothers and friends.<br><br>As for straight men, we crave not just sex, but the love of a girl. We desperately want to see joy and admiration in her eyes, and we<sq>ll give anything to keep her safe and provide for her. We love the feeling of her delicate arms around our neck and her waist between our hands. Her voice brings us happiness- we<sq>ll be having a rough day, and hearing her talk and laugh is like a door opening in a dark room and sunlight pouring in.<br><br>And for all men of all sexual orientations, our love extends not just to our wives and girlfriends, but the other women in our lives that we care about as well. I have a friend in my hometown who<sq>s the closest I<sq>ve ever had to a little sister and I love to see her smile. I<sq>ve never had a romantic or sexual interest in her, but she<sq>s one of my closest friends and I will always love her like family.<br><br><br>Men experience ambition as well. We have dreams about what we want to do with our lives and we work hard to achieve it. We<sq>ll sacrifice decades of our lives, our youth, our strength and our time to build a career and a name for ourselves. Sometimes those ambitions include a family. We will give our health away to provide for a family and a wife, and we<sq>ll do it not because we have to but because we *want* to.<br><br>We experience serenity sometimes when we sit back in our rocking chair and look out at the world. We love to feel the breeze tousle our hair and smell the pollen in the summer air. We love to see fireflies dancing at dusk, their little lights flickering on and off and we love to listen to a gurgling creek. If you ever wonder why so many men love to fish, it<sq>s because we can be alone with our thoughts and the world and listen to the waves lapping at the sides of our boat.<br><br><br>We experience empathy and compassion. When we see a homeless man shuffling past on the side of the road- stiff-legged, weak, and hungry, with  all that human pain in his tired eyes- we feel a stab of anguish in our hearts and we pull over to help. His suffering is our suffering; we feel it in our soul.<br><br>Some of these things we feel because we are men, and men are indeed different than you in some ways. But mostly we feel these things because we are people. We are human, and we<sq>re more like you than you realize.<br><br>Good luck.</p>",

Your father was right that most men want sex, but it was very wrong of him to imply that this means they want to take something away from you and harm you in the process.

A lot of people are supportive of you here, and though I sympathize, I<sq>ll play devil<sq>s advocate. <br><br>Because you are his guardian, you have a fiduciary duty to do what is in your bother<sq>s (your ward<sq>s) best interests. Should a court ever learn that you used your position to solicit a prostitute on your brother<sq>s behalf, it could mean big trouble for both of you. If prostitution is illegal in your area, you are using your position as fiduciary to help your brother commit a crime, and are likely committing a crime by securing a prostitute<sq>s services. Even if you don<sq>t use your position as conservator to use your brother<sq>s money to commit this crime, you may still violating your fiduciary duty.<br><br>Should a court discover that you have done this, the court could order a hearing to determine if you are still suited to serve as guardian/conservator. Even if you are never charged with a crime yourself, the court would likely not view your actions as serving the best interests of your ward, and your position as guardian would be jeopardized.<br><br>And this isn<sq>t even considering the implications of someone with a 13-year old intellectual capacity<sq>s ability to consent to sex. If your brother doesn<sq>t have capacity, any sex act in which he might engage could be considered a sex crime, such as statutory rape or sexual assault, on the part of the sex worker who engaged in the act. You, as the person who secured the services, could be charged with the same crime on an aiding and abetting basis. So, even if you live in an area where prostitution is legal, or travel to such an area, the idea of consent is still a significant concern.<br><br>These are extreme examples I<sq>m making, and it<sq>s questionable whether any of these outcomes is likely, but you should be aware of the legal issues involved. (See, for example, [this](https<colon>//www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/05/sexual-autonomy-rights-of-the-mentally-ill/) article on sexual autonomy and intellectual capacity, and [this](http<colon>//www.guardianship.org/training_modules/Sexuality.pdf) discussion of sexual autonomy issues for wards and guardians.)<br><br>In short, you need to think about this carefully. I think contacting an attorney first to talk about what consequences it could have for you and your brother would be prudent.

In a nutshell<colon> 15 years ago, most male children had computer access, most women didn<sq>t. Men had a head start on education and now we<sq>re reaping the consequences. A resulting implication of this is that **one of the best things you can do to resolve the tech gender gap, is education**. Not just formal education; that<sq>s by far the least important part. Cultural education. Experiential education. Access. Knowing how to interact with relevant people and communities. Knowing how to ask questions, which questions to ask, and how to find answers. Developing a student mindset and hacker spirit.<br><br>To that end, I volunteer with a handful of charities that try to fill this educational niche for women who want to enter software development. They provide complete-beginner introductory lessons for people who have never programmed before. They match up beginners with mentors and continuing education resources.

Husband wasn<sq>t home, wife panics - there<sq>s an unstable guy in her house looking in the fridge for gas.  Cops are called, he panics and fights with the cops and he gets arrested.

It<sq>s the idea that supply finally begins to dwindle, driving up demand. We currently get water from 3(ish) sources. Weather, aquifers, and Rivers. Now Aquifers are underground lakes that were built by rainfall hundreds of years ago. They<sq>re little outlets of clay in the earths surface. But once you use it up, the clay hardens and cracks and it<sq>s impossible for the area to serve as an aquifer. Thanks to our use of cement, a lot of rain that might have recharged the aquifers in past years, has sadly gone down the storm drains. What water we can collect from the rain and snow, is laughbly small compaired to what we need on a yearly basis. And we have already successfully dried up the Colorado river due to water harvesting. (It no longer reaches to the sea in the summer.) Peak water is natures hard set deadline. We **have** to have changed our lives styles before this time or nature will force a massive die off on the simple grounds of there not being enough fresh water to keep people alive.<br><br>i could go on, but I have a bus to catch.

I<sq>m watching her work right now at the kitchen table in the house we just bought this Fall after many years of hard work and planning. Next week we will have been together 15 years, we<sq>ve been married for 10. I was 19, she was 18, we were in college together and never could I have imagined that things would go the way they did. After watching my parent<sq>s messy divorce I thought it would be a long time before I considered marriage, but when we found ourselves confronting the fact that she would have to leave the country I knew that I couldn<sq>t live without her. I can<sq>t thank my 19 year old self enough for somehow not screwing it up. I have a distinct memory of the epiphany I experienced when I realized that I could trust her to really Love me, forever. She has been the light of my life and a joy to everyone around her and I couldn<sq>t ask for a more loving, understanding, inspiring, supportive and just plain fun-to-be-with person with which to grow older and happier. I owe her more than I can imagine, and I profess my Love for her daily. <br>   I<sq>ve learned a lot about Selflessness and Selfishness and my own personal struggle with each. A marriage has an equilibrium that requires far more of the former than the latter. However, the latter is necessary to insure each party has their needs adequately cared for and recognized. I<sq>ve (we<sq>ve) had to compromise in many aspects, but the outcome has always been benificial for us both. Also we have both given each other ample space for our own individual recreational pursuits and hobbies, she<sq>s got yoga and dance while I play music and disc golf, as well as spending lots of time together camping, biking, kayaking and playing games.<br>   No we don<sq>t have kids, could you tell? We<sq>re planning on that now that we<sq>ve got the house. I was worried that if we had kids first we<sq>d never afford a house. It<sq>s also afforded us the time to build our respective careers, pursue some dreams, move to new places, travel together and really enjoy developing together as a partnership. I really feel I have gotten to enjoy my marriage with the person I love first and foremost, and now I have something wonderful to share with a new life in this world, rather than feel they are taking something from me (even though that is inevitable). <br>   Now I have a mature, thoughtful, caring, loving and even still excitingly sexual relationship with the woman who truly Loves me and I truly feel the same. Everyone tells me regularly that she is an amazing human being, that we have a wonderful partnership, that we are lucky to be together and to have found each other. Considering that we were born in two countries which were at war with one another, separated by thousands of miles, and could so easily have missed one another in passing, I couldn<sq>t agree more. I Love you, Lyubov. </p>",

Sure, it means we don<sq>t tend to marathon TV shows and I don<sq>t get through 100 hour epic RPGs in a week or two anymore, but our relationship is so much stronger because of it that I can<sq>t help recommending it to anyone.<br><br>TL;DR<colon> Find a person that you enjoy doing most things with, even the shitty and boring stuff. Communicate your shit, whether it<sq>s reasonable or not, because talking it out almost always helps. Turn off the electronics and have sex as often as possible.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Relationships are a lot harder than they seem. As a heteronormative, heterosexual male who started dating in his 20s, this is my list.<br><br>* Other people judge you based on your girlfriend, probably more than they<sq>ll judge you based on yourself. They<sq>ll judge her  clothes, her makeup, the things she says. It<sq>s ridiculous.<br><br>* Women seem to believe that the only time it<sq>s okay to objectify a man is when he has a partner (perhaps it<sq>s because he<sq>s <dq>safe<dq> ?) and it<sq>s annoying. It<sq>s like my <dq>game<dq> goes up much more, despite not actively looking for any women, when I<sq>m with my girlfriend.<br><br>* If you<sq>re a virgin, virgin sex is nothing like it<sq>s cracked up to be. I<sq>m not sure where the myth arose that you fall in love with the first girl that takes your virginity, but you don<sq>t. This is probably more correlated with age rather than actual virginity.<br><br>* You<sq>ll never have young love. For good or for ill, people in their 20s expect you to not fall head-over-heels, not do stupid romantic things, not throw portions of your life away for love. If you do these things, your partner will see you as clingy and move away from you.<br><br>* Repeated sex gets better. You<sq>ll learn your preferences, you<sq>ll learn your partner<sq>s preferences, and you<sq>ll learn the special things you want your particular partner to do with you. It<sq>s great<br><br>* It<sq>s hard to see the point when a relationship is about to go south. Your first time you probably won<sq>t. But it<sq>s often helpful to look back at a relationship and see exactly where it went wrong, so you won<sq>t repeat the mistake.<br><br>* Learning to merge groups of friends is a good skill. If you date someone in your direct group friends it<sq>s easy, but most of them time the girl will be a couple degrees removed from your friends, so learn how to have with her friends, and she should learn how to have fun with your friends.<br><br>Skills and Knowledge<colon><br><br>* I regret not dating before my 20s. Women are constantly inundated by men, and develop much higher standards in their 20s than they did in their teens. People who have dated in their teens also know, roughly, in their 20s what <dq>type<dq> of partner they<sq>re looking for. Women (and men too, naturally) judge you based on your perceived <dq>type<dq>, despite you not knowing what <dq>type<dq> you<sq>re looking for.<br><br>* Learn to separate love from lust, and learn to realize whether a girl wants love or sex. Many women in their 20s just want to sleep with you, and there<sq>s nothing wrong with that.</p>",

Sit down with them and tell them WHAT is bothering you, HOW it makes you feel, and WHY it makes you feel that way. It<sq>s easy for a conversation like that to turn south when the other person feeling like you<sq>re attacking them, when they<sq>re usually just trying to entertain themselves. Basically, you need to do something more than just criticize them and try to make them feel like shit. You also need to understand that if you<sq>re going to ask them to stop being on their phone so much, you need to be able to tell them that you are going to work on not being bothered so much about them being on their phone. This kind of thing works two ways, make no mistake. You will have the greatest amount of success when you compromise when asking others to do the same.<br><br>After you<sq>ve talked to them about the problem, *you need to recognize when they are trying*. Give it a day or two, and then compliment them and let them know that you have noticed their effort in trying to be better, even if the effort is very small.

I normally prefer to remain quiet and keep to myself.

There<sq>s a measure of reckless abandon involved. You have to set the awkwardness aside and not give a shit if you embarrass yourself. You just surrender to it and wade in.<br><br>So, your best tool in carrying conversations and engaging people is asking questions. There are many, many topics that are commonalities and probably safe topics. Everyone has a past, a childhood, family, loves music, enjoys food, have either traveled or want to travel, has a job, etc.  And, generally, people like an opportunity to talk about themselves or share their thoughts. Ask the other person questions and they do all the talking. The art and skill in this is listening to their answers, validating their response, and asking more questions. Essentially, you<sq>re demonstrating interest in them. Everyone likes to feel as though they<sq>re interesting.<br><br>Also, if you<sq>re not good at small talk, then make it big talk. Small talk is difficult because it is small. There isn<sq>t much to say about it. So, take something more complex. I mean, you can<sq>t just walk up to strangers and ask them for their treatise on the nature of the human condition. But, once you have begun a conversation with someone, it<sq>s ok to table thought provoking topics. When a conversation lulls, clever segues are nice but it<sq>s ok to make abrupt subject changes, too. <br><br>With all of that said, it<sq>s ok if a conversation doesn<sq>t flow.

It<sq>s hard to give suggestions without knowing your sex life, but trying new things is always a good idea, as long as everyone is comfortable with them.<br><br>For me, acting slutty is about being aggressive and inappropriate. Slide your hand down his pants at the table, flash him in public when nobody is looking, come back from the bathroom and hand him your underwear.

Even then, guys will often interpret the type of (often) subtle flirting that women do as too vague - either it<sq>s best to assume its not flirting in case you<sq>re wrong (and possibly be mercilessly shot down), or the fact that you think women aren<sq>t interested in you leads you to pass it off as you misreading the situation.<br><br>6. It takes experience to learn how to be rejected and many guys take a long time to get comfortable enough with this to put themselves out there enough for things to work.<br><br>Really, I think it<sq>s largely the first four. I mean the last two are about when guys take the initiative and try, but if you take that away and just think about everyday life, those are the ones that affect you. If you go through life never being given a compliment about your appearance (by anyone other than, say, your grandma), never notice women checking you out, and always have to do all the approaching and effort, then its not surprising that you<sq>re going to think you<sq>re not attractive. I know I think that way, but am trying to change it. The girl I<sq>m seeing told me she thought I was sexy and it floored me - I said *<dq>really?<dq>* and she was surprised that it wasn<sq>t obvious to me.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Back in College, I was the stereotypical frat bro. Partied, drank and had lots of casual sex as much as possible.  At the start of my third year, I was at one of the frat events to which my fellow lotharios would as usual invite a ton of drunk freshmen to party in the hope of getting laid really easily.  I always found this a bit sleazy and preferred to hook up with people closer to my own age, but I wasn<sq>t going to stop them as long as it was consensual, which it was. <br><br>So I was hanging around, stressing about applying for summer internships and failing less this year than last and my grandfather being ill and so on, all while trying to keep the party going and making things run smoothly, when I saw quite possibly the hottest girl I have ever seen standing awkwardly in the corner.  I had promised myself that I would not hook up all the time this year but I figured that if I didn<sq>t take this girl, someone else would and that would suck as well.  <br><br>So I grabbed a drink and spoke to her.  Turns out we had a lot in common. We spoke about politics, science, our opinions on the future, made fun of some of the radical left wing people who had been protesting on campus earlier that week, joked about college life and she said that she had been quite the loner at school and that she had been dragged by her friend to the party.  She also said she didn<sq>t drink for religious reasons (later I found out that she had read some horror stories about being raped at frat parties so she had made up that excuse.)<br><br>But we kept talking and talking until we were the last people downstairs.  We fell asleep on the couch, curled up together, literally having not even made out. The next morning I asked her out and things went from there.   Today, we<sq>re together 8 years, married for 3.  </p>",

                "answer": "<p>For my part, the one really important thing we should have talked about before we moved in together was personal space and alone time.  In my experience, moving in with someone you<sq>re in a relationship with often means the implicit expectation of spending more of your free time together than you used to.  This is especially relevant for the free time spent in a room both of you would use frequently, and might like to use at the same time, like the living room, so if your preferred mode of unwinding is gaming, or pigging out on the sofa with a mindless tv-show she doesn<sq>t like, without having to deal with other people, this should be addressed.  I have friends who live with their girlfriends, and while they don<sq>t say it explicitly, I can tell by the way they talk about it that they miss being able to spend a whole saturday engrossed in some solitary activity they used to love, but now can<sq>t find the time for because she expects them to do stuff together whenever there<sq>s time.<br><br>There are obviously huge individual differences here, but I am personally someone who needs alone time to unwind and get rid of the stress of a long day of work or studies.  It<sq>s essential if I want to function properly, and when I don<sq>t get it, it affects my level of general happiness.  As a result, I can get irritable and resentful, which is never a good factor to bring into a relationship.  Additionally, she might get resentful of you for not wanting to spend time with her, and then you<sq>ve got a carousel of small annoyances going which given time could really sour the relationship.<br><br>Of course, the same goes the other way around<colon> you might be the one wanting to spend a lot of time together, while she needs a certain amount of alone time to be happy.  Whichever it is, and whatever other problems you might have (and there will be problems, no matter how well you prepare), the key thing to making this work is communication.  If you<sq>re not able to be open and honest with eachother regarding your own needs, perceptions and feelings, living together will never work.  This might be a banal point, but in all its banality, it is also the one tenet of successful relationshipping everyone breaks at some point, and the breaking of this tenet is likely one of the most prevalent reasons for why relationships fail, so it never gets old.</p>",

However, you have to do it right.<br><br>There are literally only three parts to tinder. Your photos, your bio, and your messages. Three. That means you only have to learn how to do three things right in order to have Tinder success.<br><br>1. YOU NEED A GOOD QUALITY PICTURE. I don<sq>t care how unattractive you think you are, you<sq>re only going to look about ten times worse if you don<sq>t have a good picture of yourself on there. This is the biggest mistake that guys make. This means no weird webcam pictures, no dark selfies that hide half of your features. No hunting and fishing pictures where you<sq>re wearing sunglasses and a hoodie. No bathroom mirror pictures. All of that stuff makes you seem out of touch with the real world. I don<sq>t care if you use a family photo with your mom and dad next to you, USE A GOOD PHOTO, PREFERABLY WITH YOU SMILING. I don<sq>t care if you<sq>re four hundred pounds, if you<sq>ve got horrific teeth, or if you<sq>re dealing with male pattern baldness. I don<sq>t care what<sq>s wrong with you. GO OUTSIDE (in good but not blinding light) and have a friend take your photo while you smile. It will totally change how many girls swipe right. I could write pages and pages about how important that first photo is. It will make or break your tinder experience.<br><br>2. Your bio. Jesus, your bio. If you don<sq>t know how to be funny or if you<sq>re really unsure of what to write in that little box, then don<sq>t write a bunch of meaningless shit. Don<sq>t write <dq>I don<sq>t know what to write in these things<dq>. Be confident and funny, list your interests and hobbies, and a couple of quick details about yourself that are relevant. If you don<sq>t know what to write, then fucking google search <dq>funny tinder bios<dq>. It<sq>s better than nothing.<br><br>3. Contact. When a girl finally does swipe right because you have a kickass good quality photo and a hilarious to-the-point bio, you<sq>re going to message her ONCE and wait for a reply. If there<sq>s no reply, that means that she liked your initial photo, but didn<sq>t read your bio or see your other photos. She matched with you and looked, and she is no longer interested. If this happens to you a lot, you need to change your other photos and rework your bio. THIS IS THE MOST VALUABLE PART OF TINDER!!!! THIS IS FEEDBACK! CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM!!. If you<sq>re having initial success and matching with women but not really getting anything going when you try to message them, it means you<sq>re doing something wrong with your other photos or your bio. Rework, rework, rework. If she responds to your message and it goes somewhere but then dies off, that means you<sq>re boring or you suck at messaging. Rework, rework, rework. Try again.<br><br>I have had a shit-ton of success from Tinder, but it didn<sq>t start out that way. You have to do it right. Tinder is one of the greatest tools I<sq>ve ever used for helping me in my social media game. It<sq>s basically mobile speed-dating that you have complete control over. I<sq>ve found three serious relationships from it and countless dates and hookups, and it was a breath of life into my success with women. <br><br><br><br>EDIT<colon> If anybody needs help with their tinder profile, I will fucking coach you.

Hobbies or anything?<dq><br><br>Her response <dq>uhh... i have no hobbies...<dq><br><br><dq>ok, well how do you spend your free time?<dq> <br><br><dq>I dont know<dq><br><br><dq>haha ohh k, well anything interesting youve done in the past few years?<dq><br><br><dq>well i travel a lot...<dq><br><br><dq>Where to?<dq> <br><br><dq>Georgia, Greece, Italy...<dq> (the list went on and on)<br><br><dq>So, then that is your hobby. Traveling is your hobby. Do you love it? Where was your favorite place to go? What was the funnest thing you did, funniest? Scariest?<dq><br><br>And then just like drawing water out of a rock, the girl started opening up and got into the conversation. Ended up having a great night, giggidy, and that<sq>s when I knew that I finally knew how to talk to women. <br><br>The next step is to relate that to yourself, and your own interests and passions. If you dont have any, then you are lame. Sorry, go get something that interests you, the world is an unbelievable and magnificent place, and if nothing excites you, then you are boring AF. <dq>If you are bored, you are BORING.<dq> <br><br><dq>Oh yeah that<sq>s awesome! I havent gotten to travel much, but a huge reason I started playing music was to travel the world, it hasnt happened so much with world travel yet but it has definitely taken me to places I never would have, and introduced me to people I never would have.<dq><br><br>So ask women about themselves in terms of what they are interested in. Dont fucking ask them a questionaire. <dq>Where do you work? How many siblings do you have? Oh. Cool.<dq> Ask open-ended questions to get them talking, people love talking about what they love, simple as that. (And themselves of course haha.) then relate that to yourself in some way to form a connection and keep the conversation going. If there is a brief lull in it, or an <dq>awkward silence<dq> just chill a second. Dont rush things or get nervous. Have a sip of beer and relax...<br><br>Once you get good at that, then you can get good at teasing. Just general, good-spirited <dq>arguing<dq> or <dq>noncompliance<dq> with some ballbusting is the best Ive found, to make a girl laugh with spontaneous behavior. Especially with the entitled bratty girls who expect to be waited on hand and foot. Just dont do it. <dq>Hey can you go get me my purse?<dq> <dq>Absolutely not.<dq> (without being a dick.) If they take it too seriously, then bounce cuz they are uptight and suck. <br><br>I had a longer post on how to make girls laugh if anyone is interested I can go into it, but just fucking with them a little bit so that they are shocked but not actually annoyed or angry is the best. Dont push it too much, but be lighthearted and never do things the boring way.... </p>",

                "answer": "<p>I<sq>m a hairy Indian dude who maintains a hairstyle. <br>Firstly find a good barber. You<sq>re not looking for a stylist or a salon, a good old fashioned barber. <br><br>Second the haircut you<sq>re looking for is similar to mine, and can be described multiple ways. I<sq>d say show your barber a picture first, but generally what you<sq>re looking for is a side part contour with a fade.<br> <br>Third, you pay when you<sq>re done with the cut. Prices vary, I don<sq>t know where you are so I can<sq>t help myself. I personally tip $5 on a $30 cut, if you build a relationship with your barber it<sq>s just one more thing that is smooth in your life. Consistent tipping helps. <br><br><br>Fourth, shampoo when your hair gets dirty, I shampoo every 2-3 days for the most part. <br>Tips<colon> buy a nice pomade. I<sq>d suggest starting with a water soluble pomade. I like cool grease XXX. Best value I<sq>ve found. You<sq>ll also need a good comb and brush. Kent no9 for comb, denman for brush. Trust me. <br><br><br>As far as styling, just tell your barber this is a new haircut for you and you need to be taught how to style it. If he<sq>s worth his salt, he<sq>ll cut your hair accordingly to make it easier for you to style. Getting your hair perfect every day shouldn<sq>t take long, but it is a skill that takes time to perfect. <br><br>Any other questions let me know. </p>",

First off 17 years is fucking tight man, and as someone who has been growing my hair out for more than 2 years, I would first start out by saying do you really want to do this? Haha. Long hair is bad ass. Anyways, to your questions. <br><br>1. Those numbers are an indication of length. I<sq>m not sure if it<sq>s inches or something, but the larger the number the longer it is, although it<sq>s still usually really short. So like a 1, is borderline shaving it bald, and like a 4 would be a bit longer with more hair. It<sq>s basically how close you are going to shave to the head.<br><br><br>2. I have never really faded my hair or anything. So I don<sq>t really know. But a picture always helps explain. I<sq>d definitely use it as a visual aid.<br><br><br>3. You just have to explain it. I don<sq>t know how long your beard is, but you usually use length. As in, <dq>I want about 2 inches taken off.<dq> Or you want to make it evenly cut all around. Something to that effect. I shave on my own, so I don<sq>t really know.<br><br><br>4. Some have, some haven<sq>t for me. I would imagine it<sq>s just preference. But if they have the time and the products, they<sq>ll probably do it up for you to show you the finished product. <br><br><br>5. It depends on the business and how you pay. Most likely will have a counter. I usually tip 15-20<percent> or even more if I think they gave really good service. It depends if you pay in cash or card, you just give extra cash or write a tip on the receipt they print out. Just like a restaurant.<br><br><br>6. I feel like it depends on the length. When I had short hair, I rarely used any product until about three weeks to a month. You don<sq>t have a lot to take care of when it<sq>s short. Now I shampoo twice a week and condition (just the tips) every other day. You<sq>ve been taking care of yours for 17 years, you will know how it grows. <br><br><br>7. Not really. It<sq>s just hair. It becomes normal really fast and you will do with it what you want. <br><br><br>The barbers are professionals man, so just ask for their opinions, talk about it, and let them do their thing. Hair grows back. If it<sq>s not perfect, you make the best of it. It<sq>s not a huge deal.</p>",

Humans are strange creatures so no two justifications are going to be the same. For that the best I can do is come up with two anecdotal examples that might generally jive with other answers.<br><br>Some time I ago I cut an ex-girlfriend out of my life completely because the history of our relationship was too volatile and too raw to make associating while trying to move on any easier. To wit, this was at the end of an extended on/off/on periods of ups and downs. At some point I realized that although neither of us are bad people and I respect and admire the hell out of her, we<sq>re just not good together for a variety of reasons but neither of us were willing to admit that. So I made the decision to cut things off completely.  <br>It sucked at first but we<sq>ve both moved on and grown as people, and (relatively) recently we<sq>ve been having the occasional coffee or lunch together in order to catch up. Essentially we<sq>re building a friendship again from the ground up, and the chaff of previous bad blood needed to be exorcised before that could happen.<br><br>More recently I<sq>ve cut off a sizable chunk of extended family for their attitude towards my current girlfriend. I<sq>ve been dating an intelligent, vivacious, warm, loving, and beautiful woman since October of last year who just so happens to be equal parts Puerto Rican, Persian, and Irish in regards to her ancestry. Put plainly, she looks very latina when compared to my white western European self. For the most part my family doesn<sq>t care, heck my immediate family took to liking her almost right off the bat and the extended family I see most often likes her as well, in fact I have a cousin who lives nearby who has two little boys and they think she<sq>s one of the greatest people ever.  <br>However, that hasn<sq>t stopped other members of my extended family from making passive-aggressive inferences about her heritage, things like querying about her legal status, or if she has family members in jail (she does, but it<sq>s her meth-head second cousin who<sq>s a moron and got caught without a valid driver<sq>s license multiple times), and other not-that-subtle references to not approving of an interracial relationship in the family. Bear in mind this is the *second* time I<sq>ve had to deal with this crap, and this time around I decided I<sq>m not taking it. I didn<sq>t tell them anything, I just stopped picking up their calls and de-friended them on all social media. Haven<sq>t had to make a choice yet but if it comes down to going to family gatherings where they might show up I might just find something else to do instead.  <br>In this instance I don<sq>t hate my extended family (although I really don<sq>t like quite a few of them), but their rather comic prejudice isn<sq>t really adding anything to my life and is only going to cloud any potential positive relationships I might have with them, so it<sq>s better to just cut them loose and see if they<sq>ll get the big idea that way. <br><br>Maybe those examples help? Sometimes people need to be excised out of a life in order to make progress or just move on.</p>",

I<sq>ve been in a similar situation to you. Of course, I live in an American city probably with a larger population than you. My best friend and I have been buddies since kindergarten.  As we grew up he played basketball a lot and was tall. By high school he was significantly taller than me. I always looked really young compared to him. People thought I was in 7th grade while people questioned whether or not my friend was actually a college student. He assimilated into the <dq>popular<dq> kids group better than I did, but we still remained close. Girls flocked towards this tall handsome fellow and talked about him to all their friends but were always warned of his short comedic friend who followed him around. Shit hurts. I branched out and made new best friends. Not to say I wasn<sq>t still neat buddies with my old tall friend but I added new ones. It helped a lot. I found my first girlfriend through a church community he wasn<sq>t involved in. He didnt have a steady girlfriend in high school. Things always went bad, but the ladies kept on coming.  One day, when I was feeling extra inferior, I *talked to him about it*. After I was done ranting he told me how he was jealous about some things I had going for me that he didn<sq>t.  I felt a lot better. So I guess my advice would be<colon><br>1-branch out and find more friends and people who dont necessarily know your friend.<br>2- *talk to him about it* <br>I hope this helped.</p>",

Sometimes we love relationships that make us feel a certain way instead of loving the person. Figure out what love means to you and whether you love her or are in love with her.

Beyond the prospect of sex, just *feeling desired* had become such an alien concept I<sq>d almost forgotten that women could find me attractive. <br><br>Whenever a girl flirted with me, I<sq>d be stunned. After repeated rejections from a partner, I<sq>d internalized the belief I was unattractive. Even if my partner expressed love verbally, I couldn<sq>t believe her without the physical intimacy. <dq>If she doesn<sq>t want to have sex with me, she doesn<sq>t love me.<dq> Actions speak louder than words.<br><br>Although I definitely put in the effort, communicated, tried to be understanding, etc., the sexless relationships always failed and severely damaged my self-esteem. Learned you can<sq>t bargain or earn attraction (big lesson). I used to stay in relationships far too long where the girl and I were compatible in every way--except sexually. <br><br>Took me way too long to be honest with myself that I couldn<sq>t be happy in relationships like that. If I have a girlfriend, I<sq>d like to have sex with her and she should want to have sex with me. Stupid obvious. This doesn<sq>t help, but looking back, I think it was for the best that those relationships ended.<br><br>I laugh at it now, but I used to feel shame for my desires, i.e. <dq>How *dare* you be attracted to your girlfriend and want to have sex with her?!<dq> I<sq>d berate myself. Sometimes that shame came from outside too. Had to remind myself I<sq>d been with girls in the past who did enjoy frequent bedroom times with me. <br><br>There<sq>s nothing wrong with having a sex drive. Monogamy isn<sq>t just about having not having sex with other people; it<sq>s also about having sex with your partner. Some girlfriends enforced the first part, without fulfilling the second part.<br><br>Eventually, I grew out of that mindset. Now I simply think, <dq>She doesn<sq>t owe me affection; but I don<sq>t owe her attention.<dq> I<sq>ll find a partner who wants me in bed too or I<sq>ll just be single.<br><br>Do you two live together? As a side note, I<sq>ve found when you move in together, the sex will spike up for a few weeks, then plummet. Whereas with girls I dated but didn<sq>t live with, the sex stayed frequent for much longer. There have been (delightful) exceptions with live-ins, but it<sq>s a pattern I<sq>ve noticed. <br><br>I think it has to do with familiarity and keeping some space from each other keeps things from going stale as quickly. Also enmeshing my whole life with hers. Forgetting to maintain my own friends, my own hobbies, my own life. She was attracted to the guy with a well-rounded life, gotta keep that.<br><br>Admittedly, I deserve some blame for having gotten complacent in the past and should have kept <dq>dating<dq> those girls even after I<sq>d gotten into relationships with them. I took it for granted they would stay attracted once we were exclusive. Now I know better and believe that attraction has to be maintained, it never ends. Learn from my mistakes.<br><br>Ironically, it<sq>s when I<sq>ve started to pull away that some girlfriends have tried to reel me back in with sex. Like they could feel me becoming distant and thinking about breaking up with them. <dq>Oh shit I<sq>m gonna lose him. Better bang him and then he<sq>ll be okay for a while.<dq> That may not have been what they thought, but it felt that way.<br><br>(The girlfriends that didn<sq>t care about losing me had either mentally checked out of the relationship, already planned on dumping me and/or already had sights on another guy).<br><br>Giving more attention didn<sq>t work, but the withdrawal of attention did. Especially if the girlfriend sensed there was another girl or girls on my radar. <br><br>I hate to say this, but when other girls have found me attractive, it has done *wonders* for making girlfriends more interested in sex again. Like if your girlfriend sees other girls checking you out, or flat-out flirting and complimenting you in front of her.<br><br>The girlfriend will usually be pissed-off and annoyed and act like she hates it. But later that night she<sq>ll be extra enthusiastic in the bedroom (or even initiate in the first place), to remind you of what she<sq>s got. To also <dq>beat<dq> those girls, in her mind.<br><br>A few times I tricked myself into thinking the problem was resolved and would stay, when all it did was prolong the relationship unnecessarily. Once I was back on board and the girlfriend thought her competitor(s) were out of the picture, the sex would plummet again.<br><br>Reading over what I wrote, it probably sounds like all my exes were bad like that. There were certainly good ones. It<sq>s just the nature of the thread made me recall the bad experiences.<br><br>Things are better now. I<sq>m honest with myself about what I want, and recognize there<sq>s a responsibility to maintain attraction. Gotta do my part. It<sq>s okay to lose bad partners and worth it to find good partners.<br><br>EDIT<colon> Here is a comment where I shared some resources. Realized I didn<sq>t give much actionable info.<br><br>>In many (but definitely not most) such relationships, the man still wants more sex than he gets.<br><br>>How to deal with that?<br><br>I think Esther Perel addresses this question better than I can in this video<colon><br><br>[The secret to desire in a long-term relationship](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa0RUmGTCYY) <br><br>Not moving in together has helped a lot. Although that doesn<sq>t help people who are married. But I think maintaining some healthy space and having a bit of a life that<sq>s independent of your partner helps. Having your own friends, your own hobbies, etc. Give her the gift of missing you.<br><br>The other thing--and it pained me to admit this to myself--was that I just wasn<sq>t a good lover. Once I made peace with that and decided I could do better, I was able to progress and learn better how to give pleasure. Newsflash<colon> the more pleasure you give a woman, the more she will want to have sex with you. What a shocker.<br><br>[Whispers] Here<sq>s the book that helped me . . . <br><br>***Women<sq>s Anatomy of Arousal<colon> Secret Maps to Buried Pleasure*** by Sheri Winston.

We come equipped with  hardware, the  factory-installed equipment  we  were  born  with. the forces  of  nature  shaped  evolution  and produced our unique DNA blueprint, giving us blue eyes or brown skin. <br>> <br>> It also hardwired us with certain types of sexual behavior. We all know  about  the  basic  mammalian  humping motion, for instance. This isn\u2019t something we learned at school, and we didn\u2019t need Nike to inspire us, either. We just do it. <br>> <br>> We\u2019re  not  just  our  hardwiring,  though.  We  also  come  loaded  with lots of software\u2014our extensive programming, also known as culturally learned behavior. We probably do more learning than any other species. Much of our sexuality is learned, absorbed throughout our lifetime as we  simmered  in  the  soup  of  culture.  <br>> <br>> We  learn  from  our  culture  how to kiss and caress, what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s taboo, what\u2019s hot and what\u2019s not. <br><br>>In other words, sex is natural *and* we learn sex. <br><br>Yes please.<br><br>I also wouldn<sq>t admit to any girls you had to learn from a book. In my experience, most girls prefer a guy who was a <dq>natural.<dq> As if a guy had to stoop to the level of reading a book, he must be a loser.<br><br>However, a few open-minded girls really appreciated that I made the effort to get to know their bodies better, and was handsomely rewarded. Some reacted like having that knowledge was sexy and a big turn-on. Sapiosexual.<br><br>Thanks to who gave me the gold <colon>)</p>",

When I got to 18 through to 24 ish my weight ballooned to 28 stone (~400lbs) because of drink and depression.  I went to the gym, I cycled 20 miles a day, but the drink held me back.  I was losing weight though, because of the exercise.  Couple of years ago I got hit by a car and fucked up my knee real bad.  More drink, more depression, more weight.  At one point I was drinking 12 cans of beer a night and having take away with it.  I could afford this because of my sedentary engineering job.

On the shitter, there<sq>s a long flesh-channel between anus and exit from the cheeks, so if they don<sq>t spread mightily there<sq>s a lot of smearing. And, of course, since they eat a lot, they shit a lot. And since they eat a lot of processed garbage and fats, and not a lot of fiber, it<sq>s... easy to spread. So they<sq>ll drop trou and go to sit down and the pressure of their knees against their guts plus the substantial pressure from inside, plus lubrication... /shrug It<sq>s not quite explosive, but it<sq>s near enough as makes no difference for the janitors.<br><br>**DO NOT READ** especially if you like water parks. Or hot tubs. Or public water. So fun chemistry fact; people sweating in a hot tub, if the hot tub is insufficiently chlorinated, basically turns the hot tub into urea. As long as you keep your pool water chlorinated, though, the chemistry works out much better and it can go up your nose with no real biological effects (though of course clawing horror as you realize what that clear blue water park water contains). A number of stories report that fatties will either let loose in public water (condo or YMCA/gym hot tubs, pools, etc.), or they<sq>ll clean as far as they can (not very) and let water jets in a pool act as a bidet for the rest. Yes, this is vomitous. Yes, I have a real problem going into public water now.<br><br>**BONUS FUN FACT** The tremendous pressure that 400 pounds puts on the knees is well known, but it also puts pressure on internal organs. Like the bladder (especially for women, whose internal arrangements are a little different than dudes<sq>). If you get a whiff of pee-smell around an extremely obese person, it might be because they don<sq>t clean, but it<sq>s entirely possible that it<sq>s because their obesity makes them incontinent. Think of a concrete brick on a whoopee cushion. The same weight causes skin damage that allows certain molds to infest and feed on the dark-and-damp sections of their skin (under the folds), which explains that yeasty smell you sometimes notice around the very obese.<br><br>As an aside, I used to be 330 pounds- not quite enough to experience any of these problems, but fat enough to risk death. I am currently of normal body fat and higher than normal weight because of lifting, and I<sq>m training for my first marathon and registered for my second half. Being fat is a *terrible* experience that only seems acceptable because human bodies and minds are astonishingly adaptable.

His response? <dq>I<sq>ll be out after I finish this battle.<dq><br><br>She hung out with her friends, but eventually they all went off home and she was left to wait.

However, pulling it out the bag broke... and flooded the bathroom.

He just sent them to thier grams(who lived down the hill) and cleaned up. <br><br>I failed by showing my 4 yr old son how to make french toast. He got up at three in the morning, and decided that he was going to make everyone breakfast. He got the mixing bowl out fine, broke the eggs in the bowl(shells and all), dumped at least two litres of milk into the bowl(and most of the rest on the floor), ALL of the opened sugar in, most of the salt, and cheerios. Then he proceeded to drop the entire loaf of bread into this nightmare mix.<br><br>At this point, he realized he couldn<sq>t cook it.

My general experience is that they are thrilled with breast augs, pretty happy about tummy tucks, meh about face work (nose, lift, etc), and downright unhappy about lipo.  I think this has a lot to do with expectations.  Big tits on a previously small titted woman are usually a pretty immediate and drastic change.  Women feel more confident.  Dudes like big tits.  It<sq>s all good.  Tummy tucks are similar.  The baggy, loose skin, stretch marks, muffin top associated with pregnancy or weightloss (not all of us, but some) goes away overnight.  Face work generally is touchy.  Men like the way their women<sq>s faces look for the most part, or at least don<sq>t care much about the tiny hump on the nose or the crows feet around the eyes.  The men pay for those surgeries pretty much exclusively to make their wives happy, but they usually don<sq>t care much about the outcomes.  Lipo is the one place I see men actually come out disappointed or even upset.  Many men seem to think that paying for their wives<sq> lipo will suddenly result in having a skinny, tone, 20-something wife.  Lipo is great for spot correction (e.g., if you have a pooch under your belly button or love handles that exercise just won<sq>t seem to cure).  It<sq>s shit for making a fat person skinny, or a skinny-fat person toned, or an old person young.  I think the expectations really don<sq>t match with the reality on lipo, so a lot of husbands come out feeling duped.  Women, too, for what that<sq>s worth.<br><br>But I<sq>ll say a couple of things here.  I don<sq>t generally think much of men who manipulate or pressure their SOs to get surgery, and I think <dq>offering to pay<dq> can be a very real form of pressure and manipulation.  But if this is something that your SO really, really wants and is asking you for help with, then I don<sq>t think it<sq>s necessarily bad to pay for it.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Holy shit, people are giving you answers filled with SO many assumptions of knowledge. <br><br>Ok, so in America we have this awful waffles two party system with the Democrats vs. Republicans. Prior to elections where we get to choose between the Dem or GOP (republican) candidate, there is a series of votes called the Primary Election. In one Primary Election, various Democrats are running in one election to earn the change to be the party<sq>s choice in the main election. In the other Primary Election, various Republicans are running against each other to become the party<sq>s choice in the main election.<br><br>Now, Iowa? Well, unlike the main elections where everyone votes at once, the Primary Elections are set up in this retarded, drawn out process of a few months doing one state (or on some days, a few states) at a time. The first state to vote in the Primary Elections is Iowa, which many feel can set the trend/momentum for states to come.<br><br>***if you want additional info on how these primaries work, as the Democratic Primaries and Republican Primaries are very, very, very different... just let me know! Weird shit***<br><br>Anywho, why is it a big deal that Bernie and Hilary are tied? Well, Bernie Sanders actually wasn<sq>t a Democrat before running for President. He was an Independent- an extremely rare occurrence to have as a sitting member of Congress. Bernie was the longest standing independent to ever hold office (IIRC). So, Bernie knowing he needed a major party to go for the Presidency joined the Democratic Party.<br><br>Now, the Democratic Party is firmly behind their ticket of Hilary Clinton. I can go on for ages. EVERY Democratic Senator backing her, party maneuvers to limit the Sanders campaign from voter registry info, Huge Dem donators heading efforts to derail Sanders rallies, biased and unfair coverage by national news outlets (In America, a Supreme Court Case about 15 years ago gave News Agencies the right to blatantly and purposefully lie and call it <dq>news<dq> as a part of their freedom of speech... it<sq>s pretty obvious what 24 News Stations back who). Anywho, this was supposed to be all Hilary all day.<br><br>However, America is creeping closer and closer to massive upheaval and change. Our citizenry showed a taste of it in Obama<sq>s first election, but there was no follow up. No change. Same politics as usual. The Bernie Sanders campaign is using that energy to garner support in an incredibly impressive manner. He has gone from a dude nobody knew outside of the politically saavy or his home constituents to a huge national rally point for a movement. So we are watching what happened 8 years ago to Hilary as this unknown one term Senator named Barack Obama came out of nowhere and used the citizenry<sq>s desire for political change to beat the <dq>shoe in<dq> Clinton. This time, Bernie is doing it with a lot more obstacles making it that much more impressive. And realistically, his numbers have been going up and up, until now, on the first vote, he has finally tied her. If this continues, we have a Bernie Sanders for president ticket and a big problem for the Status-Quo (extra info and a personal bet- if Bernie takes the ticket for the Democrats, former New York Mayer Michael Bloomberg will join the race as an independent in order to siphon votes away from Sanders, which would give the Republican Status-Quo enough votes to win the Presidency. You watch)<br><br><br><br>Edit- gilded gassY! Thanks! And thank you everyone for the discussion!

Sanders<sq> supporters (especially on Reddit) have been very vocal about their support for him. And they<sq>re crying out that tying Clinton in Iowa means that it might kickfire him into the lead, similar to how Obama was an outside candidate who overtook Clinton in 2008.<br><br>**However** Iowa is the perfect state for Sanders. Sanders main base of support is white and liberal. Iowa has the 3rd highest concentration of both of these traits in the country (behind NH and Vermont). Iowa was a state the Sanders needed to win, there are no suggestions to say that Sanders will do well in more diverse states such as Nevada or South Carolina both with over a quarter of non-whites in. Iowa however was the perfect state for him, so his campaign focused much more of their resources there than Clinton did (proportionally), this is combined with the fact that Iowa has been anti Clinton since Bill ran, and that trend continued in 2008.<br><br>Sanders managing to tie Clinton isn<sq>t a victory for Sanders because Sanders should have won it had he had any shot at the ticket. Clinton was unpopular in Iowa, the state<sq>s mix of people was perfect for Sanders and the Sanders campaign focused much more on Iowa than Clinton<sq>s did. Even with all of that, Clinton still managed to tie (and actually beat by the smallest of margins) Sanders.<br><br>This leaves very very little hope for Sanders taking any states apart from Vermont and perhaps NH</p>",
