Cook the onion in a pan using grapeseed or vegetable oil until clear, then add the garlic and cook a bit longer until the garlic browns. Allow the pan to cool, drain off the excess oil and set aside.<br><br>Wash and drain the beans and add them to a stock pot (Around 8 Quarts to avoid splatter) along with the onion, garlic and the strained tomatoes. Heat until boiling and then simmer. (If you are using dry beans instead of canned beans, soak them in water for 5-6 hours and rinse before adding to the pot).<br><br>Remove the stem area of the tomatoes and chop them up whole into around 3/4<dq> chunks and add to the pot.<br><br>Allow the pot to simmer for around 30 minutes then add the coffee, beer, Chili Spice and the Crushed Red pepper (if you want more heat).

Leave the pot uncovered until the chili reduces to the desired thickness. Check and stir at least every 15 minutes. (Note it is critical that you boil the soaked dry beans for at least 15 minutes to destroy the toxic chemical in kidney beans...you do not need to worry about this with canned beans, as they are pre-cooked).<br><br>Once cooked, slowly add salt and sugar to the pot until it matches your taste. Be extremely careful with the sugar- if you add to much it will ruin the chili...add it a tablespoon at at time until you are satisfied. Also do not add the salt to the chili before it is cooked, as this will increase the cooking time.<br><br>Enjoy the chili with saltines (my favorite), cheese, chips fries, or whatever your preferred mode of chili consumption is.</p>",

Basically if you<sq>re not supposed to make noise and are, you<sq>re increasing the risk of breaking or fucking something up.<br><br>Also, work from one container to another, with a trash container. Like, one bowl for mushrooms, one for trimming and discards, and one to place product in. Keep your cutting board clean except the current focus.<br><br>Fold your towels, stay clean.

Good ones, not Jaime Oliver<sq>s best 100 Fuck Ups or whatever. Phaidon is a fantastic publisher, with restaurants like Osteria Francescana and NoMa in their collection. But also, like just badass books about ingredients and tastes and butchering and yea. You<sq>ll learn to enjoy going through a cookbook and dissecting their creative processes and cooking methods. I suggest getting a copy of The French Laundry to begin with. Or Momofuku. Both are great starter books. The Fat Duck Cookbook is a much more advanced volume but it is oh so sweet.

If you don<sq>t know what staging (stah-j / stah -jing) is, it<sq>s basically a tryout or short intern at a restaurant traditionally used as an interview, but also as a way to get around some kitchens. It<sq>s a great way to spend a day off for workaholics like 90<percent> of our industry. And a lot of restaurants will honor your time in their kitchen with a few dishes to taste their menu. And you get a feel for other kitchens, chefs, teams, cuisines, etc. AND you can network, set up more stages at better restaurants, set up future jobs and relationships within the industry.<br><br>Lastly, listen to everyone. That guy that<sq>s in the weeds every night and looks like a mess? Maybe what he tells you has some weight because he knows how he<sq>s messing up. Some of the best coaches were mediocre or even laughable players. A lot of the time everyone has sage wisdoms to share. When I train new cooks I usually try to help them beyond myself, so they start off as high off the ground as possible. If someone is giving you shit or calling you out, it<sq>s because they want to push you to be better. Take it in stride and be better, don<sq>t get offended. </p>",

All of the information in this post is based of several studies and other articles regarding MSG. I realize my thoughts my seem a bit radical, but they are merely echoing what I have researched. Also, no, I am not payed by MSG manufacturers, I am a long time contributor and moderator here.<br><br>MSG is not bad for you at all.(Under normal circumstances, reasonable amounts and based on clinical studies)<br><br><br>MSG- Mono Sodium Glutamate. Glutamate being Glutamic Acid, a non-essential amino acid. Non-essential meaning your body produces it naturally. That<sq>s right, glutamates are in your body right now! Mono-sodium meaning it is bound to sodium rather than protein or say potassium.<br><br>Glutamic Acid is a neurotransmitter. You need it for your brain to work. Without it, you<sq>ll die.<br><br>Now being non-essential, it is true you do not need to consume it, like you would say tryptophan. However, being an amino acid, which are the building blocks of protein, glutamic acid must exist in a lot of food right? Well yes it does, and plenty of it! Tomatoes, Cheese, Meats, Fish, Algae, Soy, all of those contain good old glutamic acid, aka a form of MSG(EDIT<colon> Yes, I know they are not the same thing, I am only making this point for ease of understanding). You are consuming a form of MSG whenever you eat any of the these foods!<br><br>To make MSG, you basically just must isolate glutamic acid, then add sodium. This was originally done in the early 1900<sq>s by the Japanese from seaweed in order to purify the <dq>umami<dq> flavor. They would dehydrate seaweed and being high in glutamic acid and sodium, MSG would form crystals on the top. Today, we use more modern and efficient means through bacterial fermentation.<br><br>Now that whole <dq>Chinese Restaurant Syndrome<dq>(CRS) thing. First things first, it doesn<sq>t exist. In 1968 Robert Ho Man Kwok reported feelings of <dq>numbness at the back of the neck, gradually radiating to both arms and the back, general weakness and palpitations.<dq> This occurred after he ate a Chinese-american meal and blamed the culprit MSG. Thus CRS was born.<br><br>Ever since then, CRS has scared millions of Americans though the medias portrayal of MSG and CRS. Now you will see almost every single Asian restaurant with a <dq>no MSG<dq> sign on their establishment or Menu.<br><br>The fact of the matter is, and regardless of what you have heard, there is no(read<colon> none, zip, zilch) proof(read<colon> proof) that MSG causes CRS or any other symptom(EDIT<colon> There are studies that state otherwise, just not conclusive to humans). An exception would be if you consume ridiculous quantities, i.e. several ounces(which would taste unpalatable!). In fact it is far less toxic than salt(5 times less!, 15-18g/kg vs 3g/kg), its cousin in seasoning. Again, there has been several double blind studies proving that not only did CRS not exist, but so called <dq>MSG sensitivity/allergy(Fun fact<colon> If someone ever says they have an allergy to MSG, you<sq>re talking to a ghost because they are died)<dq> didn<sq>t exist.<br><br>Conclusion/TL;DR<colon> MSG is not even remotely dangerous to humans.(Under normal circumstances, reasonable amounts and based on clinical studies)<br><br>EDIT<colon> I am not a scientist, I don<sq>t have all the answers. I don<sq>t know why you or a loved one has problems with MSG. It is possible that you have some sort of reaction, anything is possible. There are plenty of claims that have linked MSG to some side effects and claims that assert a MSG sensitivity exists. However, from the clinical studies we have done on humans, even those who identify as <dq>MSG sensitive<dq>, we have never been able to reproduce or prove any ill-effects of MSG. I apologize if I worded or provided misleading information, that was not my intention. I am just a cook and food writer with a somewhat extensive research background in MSG.<br><br>EDIT<colon> I realize my statements regarding the safety of MSG are a bit harsh. Nothing is ever for sure, and yes MSG could in theory be harmful. The fact of the matter is, we don<sq>t know 100<percent>. But we do know that we have been unable to link MSG to CRS or other ill-effects in humans during clinical studies. There are several tests and unpublished work that has given evidence to support the theory that MSG may be harmful to us, but those are not yet conclusive. Therefore, as of now, I believe it is safe to say that MSG is not harmful to humans under normal circumstances.<br><br>LAST EDIT<colon> As always, read for yourself and make the decision for yourself. This is only my opinion and what I believe based on what I have read. You might want to take the cautious route, which is fine. But since most if not all the claims regarding the hazards of MSG are not conclusive enough for me, I am fine with MSG.</p>",

My main hope this will not be a discouragement to folks in asking questions or posting tips and advice.  I bounce between here and r/cooking and find them somewhat divided by cooking having more home cooks give tips and tricks and ideas - and /askculinary will get you more pro tips and advice. Perhaps it would be good to request a formatting of the posts so everyone knows a more generalized area of what to be posting here - e.g. PRO-TIPS/ADVICE NEEDED; COOKING METHOD HELP; TECHNIQUE HELP; HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG; IMPROVEMENT or things along those lines that folks decide...?<br><br><br>Just a thought..I<sq>m not going anywhere and will continue to lurk and post where I think I can contribute. </p>",

Short answer to your question<colon> buy the little packets of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix along with some mayo and buttermilk and make your own. To my tastes, the bottled dressing tastes almost nothing like the <dq>real<dq> ranch dressing you make at home.<br><br>From Malcolm Gladwell (http<colon>//www.gladwell.com/2005/2005_09_05_a_bakeoff.html)<br><br>This was a reflection of what might be called the Hidden Valley Ranch principle, in honor of a story that Samson Hsia often told about his years working on salad dressing when he was at Clorox. The couple who owned Hidden Valley Ranch, near Santa Barbara, had come up with a seasoning blend of salt, pepper, onion, garlic, and parsley flakes that was mixed with equal parts mayonnaise and buttermilk to make what was, by all accounts, an extraordinary dressing. Clorox tried to bottle it, but found that the buttermilk could not coexist, over any period of time, with the mayonnaise. The way to fix the problem, and preserve the texture, was to make the combination more acidic. But when you increased the acidity you ruined the flavor. Clorox<sq>s food engineers worked on Hidden Valley Ranch dressing for close to a decade. They tried different kinds of processing and stability control and endless cycles of consumer testing before they gave up and simply came out with a high-acid Hidden Valley Ranch dressing \u2014 which promptly became a runaway best-seller. Why? Because consumers had never tasted real Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, and as a result had no way of knowing that what they were eating was inferior to the original.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>As a chef by profession and a chinese american, here are my thoughts. Unless you have a wok and have an ultra awesome heat source worthy of a wok(like a high pressure outdoor propane burner or any other heat source that sounds like a jet engine when turned on), you will want to cook your meats and veggies separate or in very small batches in very large saute pans. The trick to stir fry is the super high heat, and use vegetable, canola, or peanut oil because they have a higher burning temp than olive oil or butter. So put about 1Tbsp oil in a large saute pan on your largest burner on the highest heat and wait til the oil starts to smoke. Throw your thinly sliced or julienned meat into the pan, prepare for hot oil splatter, loud noises, and probably flames. this is when you start stirring it. Stir rapidly and try to toss it in the pan at the same time, it will cook very quickly. No more than a minute. Now take it off the heat for a sec and get the meat onto a plate or some vessel. don<sq>t worry if some pieces are under done. Put that pan back on high and add whatever amount of oil you lost to make 1Tbsp, wait for it to smoke again add your veggies and fresh thinly sliced garlic. If you<sq>re planning on using thicker cut veggies like broccoli, blanch them first. When your veggies are done add the meat back in along with any juices from the meat. Ok, so here<sq>s the part not everyone agrees with me on and I blame it on western cookings preference of pan sauces. Make your sauce ahead of time and add it to your stir fry at this point. It sucks when you add too much slurry and have to add more water/stock to make it the right consistency, thus diluting your flavors. It also sucks If you over season your food or make it too spicy to eat(which i don<sq>t believe is ever an issue). I prefer a simple brown sauce made by sauteing garlic and scallions until tender, deglazing with mirin, and adding brown sugar, pork stock, and soy. Reduce that by half, strain into a different pot and add fresh chopped basil, chili pepper flakes, and white pepper then thickening with slurry. So add enough sauce to attain the moisture you want and eat your meal immediately because eventually the salt will pull the moisture out of your veggies leaving you with the wet mush you enjoy eating cold at 2am. I hope this helps! Sorry about the amount of reading.</p>",

Basically the chefs have spent years mastering this, and have trained their staff to do the same.  There are other small factors like having all the right equipment, and the time and manpower to prep everything the right ways. Most home cooks won<sq>t spend 2 days making stocks and sauces, etc.<br><br><br><dq>Let<sq>s see if I can keep this relatively short, and not too technical.<br><br>Just adding a bunch of dried spices is not going to make your food better, more flavorful, and more satisfying. If you wrote a shitty fucking song with no concept of time signature, key, song structure, lyrics that conveyed any sort of emotion, etc. the advice so far in this thread would be the equivalent to <dq>add a sick ass guitar solo, bro<dq>. Which isn<sq>t very helpful if you don<sq>t really know how to play the guitar in the first place.<br><br>We have to go back to basics a little here.  Crating flavorful food comes down to managing 5 things<colon> Fat, Salt, Acid, Umami, and Aromatics.<br><br>Fat<colon> Fat is flavor, and not all days are bad for you. There is no way around that, but I<sq>m not talking about adding bacon and/or butter to everything you cook. Different fats have different flavors, as well as textures, and choosing the correct one, adding it at the correct time, and in the correct amount, will drastically change a dish.  The fat is also your vehicle for other flavor a (not just the flavor of the fat itself). The fat used to saut\u00e9 takes on the flavor of everything that is cooking in it, and then transfers that flavor to every other ingredient added later to a dish.  The fat also allows for more even heat transfer, whether it is at a low heat to sweat aromatics, creating caramelization (of natural sugars) in the heat of a hot pan or oven, or creating that Maillard reaction (browning of proteins) when searing meat. Like everything else I am talking about, this takes a long time to balance and master.  Fat is your rhythm guitar.  not flashy, and when used right, people barely even pay attention to it, but it is part of the backbone of your song.<br><br>Salt<colon>  Salt is the most important part of flavorful food. Most foods should not be salty, but ALL food needs salt to reach its pinnacle of taste (this includes sweets, fruits, drinks, EVERYTHING).  Salt activates your taste buds so you can taste the natural flavor of the ingredients more clearly, deeply, and fully.  Season every ingredient with salt as you go when making a dish.  Dumping salt at the end of cooking, or even worse, at the table, does nothing except make a dish salty. Adding salt like this only covers up the taste of bland food with saltiness, it does not coax out all the individual flavors of the ingredients that should be melding together into a symphony of flavors.  Salt is the lyrics, and the singing. Keeping with our earlier music analogy, just adding salt without giving consideration to how much and when, is like just turning on the auto tune.<br><br>Acid<colon>  By far the most overlooked aspect by home cooks.  Acid activates your taste buds, similar to salt, but adds sooo much more. There are countless varieties of vinegars, citrus, wines, and other fruits and vegetables, that can add not only the necessary acidity to a dish, but huge flavor as well.  The acid also plays the a large roll in cutting through the fat/heaviness of a dish.  The brightness of the acid is dulled with time and heat, add your acid when you are finishing/garnishing a dish.  This is that guitar solo from earlier, it won<sq>t save a shitty song, but it can the difference between a very good song, and a song that could move a person to tears with its beauty.<br><br>Umami<colon>  The WOW factor. This is the frontman that is the reason you want to keep coming back for more, show after show.  Umami is the savoriness, the fullness, you get from eating foods high in MSG.  Umami is found naturally in many foods, and is amplified 1,000x in many fermented, concentrated, and aged foods.  Things like meats, tomatoes, and mushrooms have a large amount of umami compared to most other raw ingredients, but for the real flavor, we need to look at what are known as umami bombs. These are thing a like cured meats (especially Pork), miso, soy sauce, anchovies, vegemite/marmite, fish sauce, bonito flakes, worchestshire sauce, nutritional yeast, Parmesan cheese, dried mushrooms, sundries tomatoes, tomato paste, etc.  similar to salt, adding a small amount of some of these ingredients to a dish will do incredible things, without necessarily making a dish taste like miso or anchovies, etc.<br><br>Aromatics<colon> Here<sq>s where everyone<sq>s spices fit in, along with your aromatic vegetables, to create the foundation of a dish. This is your drummer, without which all else falls apart. Everything else mentioned above is adding on the foundation your create with your aromatics.  Saut\u00e9ing the right combination of vegetables, toasting and grinding your spices (or frying them in fat) is the first step in any successful dish. There is a reason every food style always starts with aromatics<colon> the French mirepoix, the Cajun holy trinity, sofritos from Spain and every South American country, ginger/garlic/scallion in Chinese cooking and adding lemongrass and chilies for Thai food.<dq></p>",

If all the (relatively few) ingredients were thrown in a pan from the outset and cooked, it would be a comparative disaster compared to one where it was allowed to develop with , for instance the onions and garlic being sweated , the quality of the herbs, allowing the alcohol to evaporate and when to add sugar and salt. etc etc</p>",

If you<sq>re trying to do a dry-cured sausage in a home kitchen, try hanging it in your fridge. (Looping your twine around a hefty bottle on the shelf you<sq>re hanging it from is a good trick here.) Also, the holes are a good call, but they<sq>re just as much about getting air pockets out from under your casing, which goes a long way toward preventing spoilage.<br><br>3) Ice itself isn<sq>t really the binder -- it<sq>s more of a way to keep any fat you<sq>re incorporating into the sausage chilled so it doesn<sq>t melt while you<sq>re grinding it or stuffing it. Well-incorporated but still distinct chunks of fat result in a better texture than greasy melted fat throughout. Not necessary for all sausages, but it can be a big help for some, especially those with a high added fat content (like supplementary fatback, for example).<br><br>Also, generally, as far as stuffing goes, the only thing I can really recommend is a slow and steady hand. Gives you way more control over how your sausage is fulled, depending on what kind of sausage you<sq>re going for -- a loose merguez and a mortadella would require two very different approaches, and going slower would give you a wider margin for getting it right. <br><br>And, you know, sometimes it<sq>s easier if you make it a two-person job (one person to work the stuffer, another to wrangle the sausage itself), but that<sq>s okay, who doesn<sq>t love a good sausage party?</p>",

Should I press as much in there as I can, or leave it a little loose?<br><br>- You shouldn\u00b4t try to overstuff your sausages but they should generally be pretty well full after stuffing. Air bubbles are the enemies of good sausage, they expand when heated and burst, often letting all those lovely sausage juices run out leaving you with dry, mealy, crap.

Is there a way to accomplish this in a standard home kitchen? (I also tried to do this myself, but to no avail)<br><br>- I<sq>m not sure what you mean exactly by a <dq>drying process<dq> exactly but I think you may be referring to hanging them or dry-curing? This is done for particular styles of sausage and is strictly optional. To do it at home first make sure you have enough nitrites in the sausage for it to remain sanitary while it hangs, otherwise you<sq>re simply creating a wonderful place for bacteria to grow. Second, most of these cured sausage styles are traditionally hung in caves and the like, so simply find the most cave like portion of your house and hang it there, cool, dark, moderate humidity, a closet or defunct wine cooler can do a good job.<br><br>Problem #2-a<colon> Some things I read suggested poking small holes in the casings for the drying process. Necessary, or terrible advice?<br><br>- No idea, sorry<br><br>Problem #3<colon> I<sq>ve often heard of chefs using ice as a <dq>binder<dq> for sausage, particularly pork sausage, but I have no idea how this is accomplished or what purpose it serves. Is this causing my problems? Should I be doing it anyway? Should it be done for non-pork sausages?<br><br>- Ice is used sometimes when you need to make sure your mixture stays absolutely chilled, good for emulsified sausage and the like that run the risk of breaking if you run them through a grinder that is too hot, perhaps this is why they refer to it as a <dq>binder<dq>. It<sq>s also great for cleaning out a grinder after your done with it. As with all sausage though its imperative that everything be absolutely chilled when you<sq>re working with it. Throw you<sq>re entire grinder assembly into the freezer before you even start, keep the bowl that will catch the ground meat over ice, only pull your meat out of the fridge when you<sq>re ready to start stuffing, etc.<br><br>Michael Ruhlman has a book out called simply Charcuterie which is an excellent read, something like $20 on iTunes last I checked.</p>",

While you<sq>re waiting for it to boil, start making the sauce. You<sq>ll need ~250-300g of dried pasta for two, a long flat pasta will work. You can use fresh if you can find it made at a local Italian grocery or at a lot of nice supermarkets sell fresh pasta. You could make 500g for two.<br>- So I would start buy heating up a good amount of olive oil (~1/4 cup, you want it to have a decent coating on the bottom of the pan, this is the base of the sauce so you need a fair amount) <br>- I<sq>d throw in 1-2 cloves of garlic, peel them but leave them whole, and ~3 anchovies (or more if you like them a lot). Let that cook on low for a little until the anchovy has melted and the garlic is fragrant. <br>- Then I<sq>d turn up the heat a little and add the chopped up mushrooms. You can really use any kinda but if you could find them, fresh porcinis would be amazing and very Italian but they can be hard to find. Check your local farmers market. Cook these until soft and cooked. Add salt and pepper as needed.<br>- Check your water and when it<sq>s boiling, salt it with a healthy handful of salt. You want it to taste like the sea. Don<sq>t underestimate this step, it<sq>s your only chance to season the pasta itself. <br>- Add the pasta and set a timer for 1 min less than what the box says for al dente<br>- I<sq>d chop up the zucchini flowers in short wide strips and right before your pasta is done (like 2 min before), add the zucchini flowers to the mushroom and oil. If the mushroom mixture isn<sq>t very wet with olive oil, I<sq>d add a bit more.<br>- remove the garlic cloves.<br>- taste the pasta to see if it<sq>s cooked. When it is, take a mug and take out some pasta water and put it aside.<br>- drain the pasta and dump it into the mushroom mixture<br>- toss over very low flame, add a splash of pasta water if the mixture looks dry. <br>- add some grated pecorino Romano, I recommend buying a block and grating it yourself. It<sq>s super salty so don<sq>t overdo it. <br>- add some fresh chopped Italian parsley (flat leaf, not the curly one)<br>-turn the heat off and toss all that in the pan<br>- plate pasta on plates. Add a sprinkle of pecorino Romano and the fresh mozzarella on top. I recommend some fresh gooey burrata which would become a delicious sauce when cut into and mixed into the pasta. Any high quality mozzarella will do, mozzarella di bufula is always a good choice.<br>- you can garnish with another sprinkle of parsley and a few of the raw sliced zucchini flower. <br><br>PM me if you have any questions! Hope it goes well. <br><br>Edit<colon> added a step reminding you to take the garlic cloves out. </p>",

But for good, consistent moisture absorption and more even cooking times, one might slice a potato into a [tourne] (http<colon>//thetopkitchen.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/img_0289_1.jpg), which ideally has set dimensions (down to the cm), and seven even sides all the way around.<br><br>-----<br><br>When you do something like this, several things happen to drive up the price of the food you<sq>re preparing<colon> <br><br>* **Time to prep** - It takes a significantly longer time to prepare a tourne than to slice/dice a potato.<br>* **Amount of waste generated** - one tourne is generated from an entire potato. The rest of the potato is waste. Compare this to a simple dice, which might use nearly the entire potato.<br>* **Selection of produce** - skinny, misshapen or small pieces may not be able to be sliced into a tourne, so the amount of raw food that can even potentially make it to the table is a lot smaller.<br><br>----<br><br>This is just for vegetables -- butchering meat, fish, etc. can often be the same way.

But if you go to Hong Kong, it<sq>s mostly steamed. I also find that the more North in China you go, the less rice based the dishes become (possibly because in the past, rice could not survive at the colder climates) and you find that there are more noodles, buns, preserved vegetables and alcohol marinades.

Most of the secret is old rice (short grain rice - I strongly doubt his restaurant would have made jasmine rice specifically for fried rice), obscene amounts of butter, and soy sauce.  I also prefer mixing the raw egg directly into the rice (but before adding veggies).  I strongly doubt that the restaurant used a premade sauce of mirin, sugar, and soy sauce - that would require too much prep work for my dad<sq>s restaurant, haha.  <br><br>Here are my steps<colon> <br><br>1. Cook rice (short grain for me, but I<sq>m not certain that the specific type matters) & leave it overnight in the fridge.<br>2. The next day, shake up the rice so that the grains are separated and not in one large clump.  <br>3. Heat oil/butter, cook onions/whatever veggies you want.  Set aside on a plate.  Saute the garlic last, because garlic burns super quick.  <br>4. Cook meats (pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, whatever you want) in the same pan.  Let the frond build!  Seat aside on the plate with the veggies.<br>5. Add shitloads of butter to the same pan on relatively high heat.  Don<sq>t clean it in between unless something started to really burn.  Add in the rice and mix.  Hibachi grilltops use fairly high heat.  Move the rice around quickly.  This is not the time to wander off and browse reddit.  Add soy sauce.  I also like to add garlic powder.   <br>6. Whisk an egg in a separate bowl (or have it already mixed) and add it to the rice.  I like to take the pan off of the heat when I do this and let the egg coat the rice grains.  You should have added enough butter in the prior step so that the grains are still fairly separated at this point.  <br>7. Add white pepper, a little bit of sesame oil (a little goes a long way), garlic powder to taste, and add the veggies in.  <br>8. Mix and eat!<br><br><br>To me, the key required ingredients are<colon> butter, soy sauce, white pepper (there<sq>s something about it that makes it a unique flavor that can<sq>t be replicated by anything else), and sesame oil.  Taste the rice between the steps to see if you need more soy sauce, salt, white pepper, etc.  Don<sq>t wait until the end to taste it for the first time.  <br><br>Also, are you using a non-stick pan?  Non-stick is great for omelettes when it prevents the egg from sticking, but it makes it harder for flavor to really stick and build for certain things like pan sauces.

You can just read the TL;DR if you like, or read through my long explanation, and I<sq>ll punctuate it with cheese jokes.**<br><br>Right, so, to start off, cheese has a different process for making it each time. The first division is pasteurised/unpasteurised. This is whether or not you <sq>cook<sq> the milk at 62 degrees centigrade first to rid it of any bacteria such as listeria (though evidence that milk has listeria in it in the first place is very far and few between). This changes the consistency of the cheese on a small scale. An uncooked cheese will be a lot <sq>smoother<sq> and curdy. You get much more of a creamy taste with unpasteurised.<br><br>Next, you put the renet into the milk to make it solidify. You could put in a lot, or you could put in a little. The more you put in, the more the curds (cream, milk solids) separate from whey (liquids, sugars). The renet acts to break down simple proteins to separate the milk. As it solidifies, the whey is drained off for use in growing corn/wheat and so on. The more fat inside the cheese, the softer it<sq>ll be. Alpine cheese and gouda (emental, old Amsterdam etc usually has less fat than softer cheeses).<br><br>**Which cheese do you use to get a bear out of a tree?**<br><br>You can then add the blue spores if you want your cheese to be blue. They do this for some cheddars, too, even though the cheddars aren<sq>t meant to be blue. More on that later. Salt is also added. This is where a lot of flavour comes in.<br><br>**Camembert (Come-on-bear!)!**<br><br>Then the curds are cut up either large or small. Larger curds sometimes mean that the cheese is less dense. Some cheeses use 1cm^2 curds and press them together using a piston or screw. This is called <sq>cheddaring<sq>, and it<sq>s where cheddar cheese comes from. When the curds are cut, they are cut with a comb-like rake. At this stage, they are wobbly like jelly cubes.<br><br>Then they<sq>re put into the molds with holes in it. At this point, the cheese tastes like solid milk, or curds. Maybe a bit like cream, but not as rich.<br><br>**Did you hear about the explosion at the French cheese factory?**<br><br>Then the whey is drained off over a period of days (or pressed out, if it<sq>s cheddar). Softer cheeses are often just left to their own accord, so that the gaps between the curds remain in the cheese. If you<sq>ve added blue spores, they will start to grow inside these air gaps, where they are exposed to oxygen, converting the complexed sugars in the cheese into basic sugars you can taste. If your cheese is compressed to get rid of these gaps, the blue won<sq>t grow (unless you get a crack in the cheese as it matures, as you often will with cheddar).<br><br>**All that was left was de brie!**<br><br>The outside of the cheeses are smoothed to stop anything getting in that shouldn<sq>t be in, and the cheese is given a covering skin - white mold (Roquefort), wax (Wensleydale), yeast (Stilton), a wash (Stinking Bishop) or cloth (Westcombe cheddar).<br><br>Then the cheese is put away for maturing. As a cheese matures, the remaining whey in the cheese evaporates - so much so that the average cheese loses 10<percent> of its weight in evaporation every *year*. As it ages, cheese tends to get dryer and more solid for this reason, and also sweeter as the bacteria work on it. If you want a soft cheese, it<sq>ll take less time to mature. Some cheeses, like the Indian paneer are ready straight from the cloth - with a drainage time of 15-25 minutes.<br><br>**I went on a cheese diet the other day to cheddar few pounds.**<br><br>As the cheese matures, the bacteria inside the cheese (as well as any that were in the milk) get to work on anaerobic respiration, turning the complicated sugars and tastes locked away in the cheese into palatable tastes we can sense. There are also other aspects - cave moulds, cheese mites and <sq>sweating<sq> - where the skin is encouraged to <sq>sweat<sq>, leaking the whey from inside onto the outside of the skin where it stays and encourages flavour-making bacteria. Don<sq>t worry, though - these bacteria aren<sq>t harmful - and in fact act to protect the cheese from harmful bacteria that might want to grow by taking their food source.<br><br>The cheese is turned all through maturing to give it an even amount of gravity, otherwise you find it <sq>sinks<sq> to be bottom heavy. This is why cheeses are often coin-shaped (with two faces). Parmesan is one of the heaviest cheeses - weighing up to half a ton and a thousand litres of milk. These are turned by - no shit here - a cheese turning robot.<br><br>**Did you hear about the bird made of cheese?**<br><br>There are also other cheeses, like Adrahan and Stinking bishop, which have their skins <sq>washed<sq> with brine or alcohol to make it extra sticky just before maturing. This goes into the cheese from the outside, flavouring it on the way through.<br><br>**It was a curd of prey!**<br><br>Source<colon> I<sq>m a cheese monger. Feel free to give me any questions.<br><br>**TL;DR Separating the curds and whey and putting the curds back together give it the texture. Salt, skin washes, bacteria and moulds give it flavour. Age changes that flavour.**</p>",

It is very much ok to give your server a budget you want to stay under. Our budget at underbelly last weekend was $400 for the four of us. Given that budget, our server hooked us up and kept it under the budget because the kitchen was really excited to throw some new and unusual things at us. Not all were amazing. Some not worth the $35-$40 we spent on the plate. But the overall dinner was a hall of famer. You are not an asshole for wanting this, and good restaurants and good servers will savor the opportunity. It will not always end up a great evening, but if you carefully choose the right places, it can end up really enhancing an evening. Go for it and I<sq>ll bet you<sq>re going to love it. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Some of my favorites I<sq>ve tried are<colon><br><br>**Mint/chili pepper**<br>These two food items create an unbelievable balance between sweet herb and spicy flavors. This is basically the same concept as the popular cilantro and chilies, just not as overpowering on the palate. I decided to steep these two in water to make tea and what I tasted was basically a breezy spring morning in hell.<br><br>**Foie gras/blueberries** <br>I was able to try this at my old job as a restaurant<sq>s special about a month ago. House made Foie gras tortellini with a blueberry and brandy compote and fresh shaved porcini mushrooms as garnish. The sweet blueberry compote effectively cut the rich, fattiness of the duck liver perfectly while the porcini mushroom shavings added a nice subtle earthiness to finish each bite and keep me wanting more.<br><br>**Strawberry/ balsamic vinegar/ black pepper** <br>I have heard a lot of talk about this specific combination in the past year, so my friend and I decided to experiment and see what all the hype was about. We incorporated these 3 ingredients into a timbale, which is basically like a smooth, creamy, gelatin based dessert, that is baked in a mold. Anyway, I thought there was a good chance these flavors might be too assertive to be a dessert, but I couldn<sq>t have been more wrong. The fresh cracked pepper and balsamic went basically unnoticed, except for the fact that it seemed to make the strawberries have a much stronger strawberry flavor than any unseasoned strawberry I<sq>ve ever had. Next time I would love try and make a jam with this combo.<br><br>**Watercress/pineapple** <br>For me, this food combination really followed the same rule as the black pepper/strawberry flavor combo. Watercress has a fresh, peppery essence that is pretty comparable to arugula. These two ingredients, with the addition of a little mint and lemon made for an insanely flavorful and healthy smoothie. I would imagine this would make a killer garnish-type salad on top of some grilled salmon.<br><br>**Mushroom/apricot** <br>The foie gras tortellini dish really inspired me to expand on mixing different fruits and mushrooms because of how interestingly those flavors contrasted. I had some monstrous chicken legs with the skin on, so I seared them in a pan real quick and finished them in the oven. I took the pan drippings from the chicken and saut\u00e9ed some shiitake mushrooms in it. I deglazed the pan with a little white wine and apricot juice and let that shit simmer into a flavorful and balanced sauce that was both sweet and savory. I definitely want to try this on some red meat in the future.<br><br>**Fruit/chili powder** <br>The most literal <dq>sweet & spicy<dq> flavor profile I could think of. I just dusted some diced honeydew, pineapple, orange segments, and mango with the chili powder, and tossed it with a little salt and fresh squeezed lime. This turned out to be quite an explosive Mexican style fruit salad with an insane amount of flavor.<br><br>**Ham/butter** For some reason, ever since I was little I enjoyed baked ham best when it was dripping in melted butter. I think at the time I actually considered butter my favorite food. Regardless of my now educated palate, I still eat this pretty regularly. It<sq>s very similar to the flavors melted butter adds to fresh crab meat, in that it provides a rich fattiness, and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.<br><br>**Blue cheese/honey** (not really weird just delicious)  <br>Wine and cheese pairing is something I am very passionate about. It is no secret that almost any combination of cheese, fruit, and nuts is like a fucking flavor symphony on your tongue. Taking classes in both cheese and wine tasting, I have had the pleasure of pairing so many different things with them both. Of over 50 different cheeses we tried in class, hands down the best cheese I<sq>ve ever tasted was a 3-6 month aged Bayley Hazen Blue cheese. It<sq>s not the strongest blue I<sq>ve ever had, but it will still clear your sinuses for sure. This blue cheese is dense, a bit nutty, and has a strong, spicy acidity. With the edition of honey, this acid is immediately cut and you can literally taste the only farm/creamery where these cows are raised to produce this incredible cheese.<br><br>On a side note, if anyone else here is really into wine pairing, you should check out [this](http<colon>//www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http<percent>3A<percent>2F<percent>2Fwww.timhanni.com<percent>2Fcomponenets_of_flavor.doc&ei=8MnfU5CcAoORyATU9YC4DQ&usg=AFQjCNFPyJMQ_NW851WVMkvpn5xXrVh28w&sig2=Ps9FBHUwE7R12MGMUjsQCQ&bvm=bv.72197243,d.aWw) paper written by Tim Hanni. It<sq>s basically his sensory evaluation that states sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, umami, and astringency in food can either heighten or hinder these same profiles in wine. We tested his theory in class by tasting things like salt, sugar, vinegar, gorgonzola, and green apple right before tasting the wine. Basically everything I knew about food was thrown out the window that day, and the results were mind blowing.<br><br>Edit<colon> formatting<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>Judging by the stiffness and white color, it looks like what<sq>s called decorator<sq>s buttercream icing in the cake decorating book that I have ([*Professional Cake Decorating* by Toba Garrett](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Professional-Cake-Decorating-Toba-Garrett/dp/0470380098)). It<sq>s like an American buttercream, but with a 2<colon>1 ratio of butter to shortening instead of just butter; the shortening is what makes the frosting white and stiffer. Meringue powder is added to make it stiffer, and gelatin can be added in to make it even stiffer. <br><br>Here<sq>s the recipe from the book<colon><br><br>***Decorator<sq>s buttercream icing***<br><br>Note<colon> This recipe is for a 5-6 qt mixer<br><br>**Ingredients**<br><br>* 1 lb of unsalted butter, 80-81<percent> butterfat (higher butterfat and/or cultured butter like European style will cause your frosting to be more yellow and less stiff)<br><br>* 8 oz (1/2 lb) of solid vegetable shortening<br><br>* 7.5 grams (~1.5 teaspoon) of flavored extract (lemon, vanilla, almond, etc.)<br><br>* 5 grams of salt; volume measurements will vary depending on the coarseness of the salt you use, but 5 grams of Morton<sq>s kosher salt is 1 tsp (Diamond<sq>s and Morton<sq>s are the brands available nationally in the US, and Diamond<sq>s is coarser than Morton<sq>s so I can<sq>t vouch for the measurement if you use Diamond<sq>s). <br><br>* 3 lb of 10x confectioner<sq>s sugar (10x means the finest sugar you can get) <br><br>* 3/4 oz (~3 tablespoon or 21 grams) of meringue powder<br><br>* 4.5 fl oz of water, milk, heavy cream, or clear liqueur<br><br>**Directions**<br><br>1. Place the butter and shortening in a mixer and mix on medium-high speed with a paddle attachment until the fats are smooth and lightened up in color. <br><br>2. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowls, then cream for another minute.<br><br>3. Add the flavoring and salt, then mix until combined. <br><br>4. Gradually add the sugar, then the meringue powder; the mixture will appear dry. <br><br>5. Add the liquid and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.<br><br>Storage<colon> Cover the buttercream with plastic wrap, and make sure the plastic wrap is touching the frosting. It can be stored wrapped and in an airtight container for up to two weeks, or frozen for up to three months. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I<sq>m personally not a fan of shortening because it has a higher melting point than the average body temperature so I find that it has an odd texture when it<sq>s used. However, in this ratio, I do not think that the textural issue is as pronounced as it would be if the ratio is higher. If this frosting is not stiff enough for you, you can increase the ratio of shortening to make it even stiffer, but expect the texture (thus flavor) to become more unpleasant as the frosting will not melt properly in most people<sq>s mouth. <br><br>I<sq>d personally prefer to use an Italian buttercream, which is pretty similar to the Swiss buttercream that many people have recommended, but it differs in the preparation while the concept is essentially the same (it<sq>s a meringue with butter beaten into it). I prefer Italian buttercream to Swiss buttercream because I have more consistent results with it, but when done properly, there is a negligible difference, at least in my opinion. It will not be as stiff as the decorator<sq>s icing, but it is pretty stiff.  <br><br>Here<sq>s the recipe I use for Italian buttercream; you may need to add gelatin to it to make it stiffer. You can also replace some of the butter with shortening, but expect the same issues that I described earlier with shortening. <br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>***Italian buttercream frosting***<br><br>Adapted from [*Bouchon Bakery*](http<colon>//bouchonbakery.com/book). However, I added in a lot of extra little notes that I<sq>ve personally picked up as I<sq>ve learned how to cook (I<sq>ve also made this frosting recipe like a hundred times throughout the past year). Keep in mind the information about room temperature from my [previous comment](http<colon>//www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1bm7mp/sad_collapsed_cupcakes_with_broken_frosting_where/c980dy9). It takes me about 20 minutes to make this, but I<sq>d expect your first attempt to take like 40 mins or so. <br><br>**Ingredients**<br><br>* 75-85 grams of egg white (should be a little bit less than three large eggs worth of egg whites; you can probably get away with just using three large egg whites)<br><br>* A very small amount of some acid like a pinch of cream of tarter, or a few drops of some liquid acid, like lemon juice, white vinegar, etc. <br><br>* 188 grams of white sugar, split into 150 grams and 33 grams (200 grams in a cup) <br><br>* A little bit of corn syrup (optional); it helps prevent sugar crystals from forming <br><br>* Roughly 50 grams of water (50 mL, ~2 fl oz) <br><br>* 8 oz of unsalted butter (224.6 grams, 2 sticks, 1 cup, etc.); aim for 80-81<percent> butterfat, which should be the ones that are most commonly available at your grocery store. European style or cultured butter will work too, although the frosting will come out a little bit more yellow, and the higher fat content butter will cause a more buttery taste to your frosting (which may sound appealing to you, but I personally like a cleaner taste in my frosting). The butter should be cut into 1/2 inch cubes and be at room temperature<br><br>* Flavoring of your desire and to taste; for example, 1-2 tsp of vanilla extract or paste. <br><br>Note<colon> For chocolate frosting, melt 2.5 oz of ~60<percent> cacao chocolate, aka bittersweet (use the block kind, not chips unless you<sq>re sure that the chips do not have additives to help them hold their shape), although bittersweet can mean chocolates with 80<percent> or even higher cacao content, if such chocolates are used, then you should only require 2 oz of it. It<sq>ll cool down while you prepare the frosting, which is desirable, but it should not return to a solid. <br><br>**Directions** <br><br>Note<colon> For you first time through, make sure you have all your ingredients measured and ready to go (mise en place prepped) before you attempt it. As you get more experienced with it, you can separate the egg whites and other stuff while your syrup heats. <br><br>1. Combine the 150 grams of sugar, corn syrup, and water together in a small sauce pot; the taller and narrower the pot, the better.<br><br>2. Heat the mixture over medium to high heat (the exact range will depend on your stove) until the temperature reads 230\u00b0F (this is why tall and narrow is good, because the temperature is hard to read if your probe barely sticks into the syrup when it<sq>s heating).<br><br>3. When the syrup reaches 230\u00b0F, start beating the egg whites on medium to medium high speed. When some bubbles start to form, then start adding the 33 grams of sugar in slowly. Keep whipping until the egg whites just start to form soft peaks (you don<sq>t want soft peaks exactly; the white should just start to become opaque and turn white, but they won<sq>t necessarily hold a peak). The syrup should be at 248 degrees F at this point, but if it<sq>s not, then turn the mix onto its lowest speed setting. <br><br>4. Once the syrup is at 248\u00b0F, then turn the mixer to medium high, and start drizzling the syrup into the egg whites. This is the tricky part, as you have to try and aim between the whisk and the bowl, directly into the egg whites, because the syrup will cool and harden if it hits either. However, it is safer to go more towards the bowl than towards the whisk as the whisk will automatically fling the syrup to the side while the bowl will tend to have some whites that have been beaten up towards it, thus allowing the syrup to sink back into the meringue. <br><br>5. Continue beating the whites until stiff peaks are formed.<br><br>6. Feel the bowl, it should not be warm to the touch. If it is, turn the mixer to low, and allow the meringue to cool down. If not, then turn the mixer to medium, and begin adding the butter 2-3 cubes at a time, until all the butter is added. <br><br>7. Add your flavoring of choice. <br><br>Shelf life<colon> The frosting will keep well for ~5 days in the refrigerator, provided that it<sq>s covered with plastic wrap, with the wrap touching the frosting, and also stored in an airtight container. If stored in the same manner, it can last for at least 2 months in the freezer. No matter how you chose to store it, allow it to return to room temperature before using; if the texture is not light enough for you after storage, then re-whip the frosting before use.  </p>",

(It<sq>s not exactly raw, just less time curing, but needs cooking so it<sq>s a convenient way to think of it).<br><br>Apart from chorizo there<sq>s also fuet and salchichon, which are much darker and always cured; morcilla (black pudding), which is usually <dq>raw<dq> and needs cooking; and then there are <dq>tropecientos<dq> other varieties of sausages, often depending on where in Spain you live.

Try adding an extra egg white or two if you don<sq>t want to use regular milk, although albumin will give a more rubbery texture than caseins.<br><br>3. You need more sugar for browning.  1 tsp per cup of flour is generally what to aim for.<br><br>4. You need to drop the acidity of your batter for browning.  2 tsp of baking soda is not enough to <sq>use up<sq> 2 tbsp of vinegar, especially when you use almond milk instead of regular milk (less buffering capacity in my experience).<br><br>5. Your griddle probably isn<sq>t hot enough -- this (along with too much liquid) is why you<sq>re getting pudding instead of pancakes.  Yes, for thicker pancakes you need a slightly lower temp so they cook through before over-browning.

Participants are separated into two groups. One group is asked to pick out the shortest word, while the other is told to pick the word that is different from the rest. All the string of words are related, e.g. 1) sea, ocean, sand, water 2) sugar, salt, pepper, milk. The participants are then told to recount as many words as possible.

So how do you cook without a recipe?  You cook something <sq>til it<sq>s delicious.  That sounds trite but it<sq>s true.  A recipe is a guideline to get you there, but thanks to usually significant variations (e.g. with red beans how long to soak the beans, how long to cook them, how much to season them) the best stuff is never cooked precisely to a recipe.  Ever seen one that says <dq>cook onions for ten minutes, or until golden brown<dq>?  If you cook onions for ten minutes they will not be golden brown.  <br><br>The only way to do it is to do it.  Red beans are an excellent way to start because they<sq>re cheap and hard to screw up.  They<sq>ll either be bland, which you can fix, or undercooked, which you can also fix.  As long as you don<sq>t leave them for too long at too high a heat and burn them, or add in a pile of cayenne, you<sq>ll be OK.  <br><br>The keys to getting away from a recipe are (a) taste, taste, taste, and (b) approach the dish from more of an idea of who<sq>s bringing what to the party.  <br><br>(a) is fairly self-explanatory, but the critical thing is to check seasoning by continually tasting until it<sq>s where you want it to be.  <br><br>(b) we<sq>ll approach RQ with an eye towards red beans.  Clearly the focus of the dish should be your beans.  Some people like them whole; others like them broken.  Which you prefer will change how long you cook them.  <br><br>Now, I like to add onion, garlic, celery and bell pepper to my red beans because I think that gives it a better flavor.  How much?  No clue.  Enough so they don<sq>t outshine the red beans, but not so little you don<sq>t taste anything.  Otherwise, you can<sq>t really screw up - very rarely is somebody upset that there<sq>s too much or too little of either.  <br><br>Red beans also benefit from meat.  I like sausage or ham hocks, but especially ham hocks.  Ham hocks take a lot of cooking, so you want to make sure to add them early.  Again, there<sq>s no set guideline for how long to cook them--until they fall apart, generally.  How many?  Well, again, it<sq>s hard to go wrong unless you add so many the whole thing is covered in rendered pork fat, and that would be a challenge.  <br><br>Good luck with your efforts and in general, stick to dishes that are forgiving and cheap.  Red beans are perfect for that.  Once you get a couple fundamentals down, you<sq>ll be branching out in no time.  </p>",

When a recipe doesn<sq>t work out, what specifically do you think went wrong?  What might have been done differently, ingredient or step, that would have made the difference between bleh and awesome?  Is it flavor, texture, or something else?  Take notes, write down thoughts and ideas.  Over time you start to slowly learn specific techniques that work and those that don<sq>t.<br><br>Let me give you an example<colon><br><br>In stir fries some recipes say to add the garlic first to a hot pan or wok.  Now I<sq>ve learned from experience (and a stinky kitchen) that I will get burnt nasty, bitter garlic doing that.  Once I figured that out, I just started adding it later, no matter what the recipe says, so that it could soften and sweeten, but not burn.<br><br>Then I saw recipe (in some blog, I think) for a new technique where the oil is heated to fairly hot, then the pan is removed from the heat.  After a moment or two to let the oil cool, add the garlic and stir until it just starts to lightly change color.  You get more garlic flavor infused into the oil this way.  Then back on the heat and stir in other food right away to keep the garlic away from direct heat.  Worked beautifully, and now I do that every time I stir fry, no matter what the recipe says to do.<br><br>I have added other techniques such as this to my arsenal over time, just from trial and error.  Things like getting a good crust on meat, or deglazing a pan, brining meat, etc. etc.  Each one I learn gets incorporated into recipes I try out.  Eventually, new recipes are merely inspiration or a guideline, not a rule book.<br><br>The take home here is it just takes time and practice.  Try to notice certain common themes in recipes (such as, are you browning the meat? Is it a braise?  Are you going to want to deglaze the pan?) and figure out which techniques gave you the best results for these steps.  Apply to other dishes.  <br><br>As far as ingredients and flavors, don<sq>t sweat the small stuff so much.  Learn what things are sweet, salty, sour, spicy, or have umami.  With practice, you will learn what substitutions work and what doesn<sq>t.  Google is a decent resource for this as well.  <br><br>And finally, I always adjust seasoning when I<sq>m done with a recipe, and I<sq>m not just talking about salt.  With practice you start to get a feel for what kind of additives are appropriate.  Too sour or spicy?  Add a touch of sweetener.  Too flat?  Maybe a squeeze of lime would bring out the flavors.  And so on.  Don<sq>t be afraid to take a little out and experiment until you<sq>re more confident with your choices.  Flavor adjustment is a very valuable thing to practice and learn.<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>Success? I<sq>ve only worked in a couple restaurants, but as a lover of food and the dining experience, this is my take. <br><br>*#1 You have to get people in the door. The biggest part of this is word of mouth. It used to be newspaper reviews, but these days it has to be social media. Issue coupons, have specials, hang a sign bigger than Jesus, just get people in the door. Location can be a drawback here. Half the restaurants people tell me that went out of business prompt me to say <dq>What? I didn<sq>t know there was a restaurant there.<dq> If that<sq>s your restaurant, you were doomed to fail. <br><br>*#2 Once people are in the door, you have to give provide them with a good experience. Food is only a part of this! Seating should be prompt. Staff should be friendly but not chatty. Even if the food is mind-blowingly great, it should provide a value to the customer. People like to experience a restaurant. Don<sq>t be boring. Don<sq>t be annoying. Don<sq>t be dirty. Don<sq>t suck. The restaurant is the golden platter that the food lays upon. Try to make it special. <br><br>*#3 The staff. Management has to have a serious head on its shoulders. Kitchens are hotbeds of human drama. When I worked in a kitchen, the staff was having sex with the staff. The waitresses were doing coke in the bathroom. The dishwasher was selling weed out the back door. It<sq>s chaos. The management has to have the reins of that rodeo. They have to reward the good and trim the bad. It has to be harsh but fair. Not many people fit the mold of a restaurant manager. Things can go south very, very quickly.<br><br>*#4 The food. I<sq>ve put up with restaurants which failed on points 1 through 3 simply because I love their food. You have a restaurant. You are allowed to try to amaze me with food. You are not allowed to serve cold, unseasoned, dirty, nasty, average bullshit. And be honest. If a menu item sucks, cut it. I hate restaurants where the menu is too big. No cook or chef can do everything well. Make it narrow, but special. Don<sq>t try to be everything to everyone. If the people love it, listen to them and move in that direction. Do what you do, and do it well. <br><br>If you meet all those criteria, I *may* visit your restaurant more than once.</p>",

The more saturated fatty acids an oil has, the higher its melting point. In other words, the more solid it tends to be at room temperature. For example, palm oil, which has mostly saturated fatty acids, is semi-solid at room temperature.<br><br>Basically, a fat is a chain of carbon with hydrogen attached to each side. A monounsaturated fat acid is missing one hydrogen, a polyunsaturated is missing several.

If you chemically put hydrogen atoms in the gaps, you get a partially hydrogenated fat, which stays solid at room temperature, like crisco and margarine. Adding a bit to peanut butter keeps it from separating, and extends shelf life.<br><br>Partially hydrogenated fats are also known as trans fatty acids, which you hear so much press about, and are somehow different than naturally saturated fats, like lard and coconut fat.<br><br>There are various health regimes touting the different benefits of monounsaturated vs polyunsaturated fats, but I<sq>m still looking for a good scientific paper on this.<br><br>Common monounsaturated fats are, in no order; olive, canola, peanut, safflower, sesame.<br><br>**TL/DR** you friend need to get over themselves and come up with some science.</p>",

Frozen hash browns are usually used and that<sq>s what they are; cooked, cooled, and shredded potatoes. <br>Lets look at the science driving this technique. Potatoes are almost all water. That water has to be driven out of the potato for it to brown. It would be impossible for a restaurant to produce hash browns on a large scale if raw potatoes were placed on a griddle. You need to precook them to serve them efficiently. Another important factor is the consistency of the final product. Besides water potatoes are made up of a starch. Without going into detail that raw starch has to be converted into something palatable. This is done with heat, the starch <dq>melts<dq> then when cooling gelatinizes and holds its shape in a new and un <dq> melting<dq> way. Most vegetables respond in this way. Pasta, carrots potatoes are blanched, shocked (cooled) and added to soups and they retain their shape when reheating. This is what you want with a hash brown. Fully cooked starch. A non mushy interior and a crisp exterior. Soooo<br>Bake, boil, or steam a potato  that cooks the starch and drives out moisture. Cool the potato. That sets the starch. Shred. Then pan fry forming a patty and flipping once. <br>I hope that helps. I promise you that you will never go back to shredding raw potatoes, squeezing and frying. </p>",

The result is a sauce where the cheese flavor is not covered up by milk or butter.<br><br>There are a lot of recipes that you can find online using sodium citrate, but in my experience the best is this<colon> boil 1lb of dry pasta to just shy of al dente in salted water, drain but reserve the pasta liquid, add 1-1.5 cups of the pasta liquid back in, add 1Tbsp sodium citrate, then *gradually*, mixing as you go, add 1lb of shredded cheese. Use whatever cheese or combination of cheeses you like, use more cheese if you want a saucier mac and less cheese if you want a less saucy mac. You<sq>ll probably need to add more liquid--if you do, use beer, wine or the pasta liquid, and only add a bit at a time. Mix everything up well over low heat and you<sq>ll get a perfectly creamy mac and cheese with intense cheese flavor. You can also add spices and other flavors--I like a little hot sauce, a little garlic powder, a little paprika and a teaspoon or two of brown sugar. <br><br>This sauce will never, ever break. You can try your best to break it but it won<sq>t happen, and if it does just add another pinch of sodium citrate, heat it up, mix it together and problem solved. So stick it in a casserole dish, top it with bread crumbs or cheese, and bake it just the same way you would a normal mac and cheese!</p>",

Reserve a bit of your chick-pea liquid from the can (you might use this, see below).<br><br>(BTW, make sure your tahini is well mixed. You should store it upside down, as that makes it easier to mix. You want a uniform creamy tahini, not a big solid chunk.) <br><br>The order of processing doesn<sq>t matter much but you might find a better distribution if you put your oil, lemon juice, salt, and garlic in first and blend them up a bit (don<sq>t go wild here, just introduce them to each other to get the party going), then add your chick peas and tahini.<br><br>Always have extra of all your ingredients, because it all comes down to tasting it as you blend.<br><br>Now, you said you use water to thin - I wouldn<sq>t do that. I<sq>d use a bit of the reserved chick pea liquid or extra oil.  Actually, I try to avoid thinning (see below).<br><br>As per the chunkiness etc - this comes down to personal preference. Some people like a chunky hummus, some people like a very creamy and smooth hummus.  Personally, I<sq>m in the middle.  I like my hummus to have texture but not to the point of actual bits of chick peas.<br><br>So - go to a point in your blending where you are **just about** to your desired texture and thickness.<br><br>Then stop the blending and taste it... You WILL taste each ingredient - but the important thing here is the balance.  Too much lemon?  Add a bit more tahini.  Too much tahini?  Add a bit more lemon, oil, or chick-pea liquid.  Not enough salt?  Add a bit more salt (but go easy on that). Too thick but everything else is balanced? Add chick-pea liquid. Blend, and repeat until it tastes balanced.<br><br>Try to avoid adding more chick peas at this point as they won<sq>t blend well (unless you like a few chunks) - it is better to put in the desired amount of chick peas up front and then bring every other ingredient up to balance.<br><br>Ok... now you have your blend done - looks good, nice texture, tastes balanced.<br><br>But you can STILL taste every ingredient... what to do.<br><br>**Here is the secret...**  Cover it and stick it in the fridge for a day.<br><br>Hummus is one of those dishes that requires time for the flavors to integrate and blend.<br><br>I never eat hummus the day I make it (except for tasting of course). I always serve it the next day (and the next, and next, and next). You will be amazed what 24 hours in the fridge does for a new batch of hummus. (BTW, warning... garlic intensifies over time.)<br><br>Just prior to serving, follow these steps<colon><br><br>* Remove from fridge and uncover (duh) - don<sq>t stir. (Edit, and as Fishercat points out, let it come to room temperature.)<br>* Drizzle olive oil over the top (not too much - you don<sq>t want to go swimming)<br>* Sprinkle a few whole chick peas on the top (makes a nice presentation and satisfies those who like a chunk or two) - this is fairly traditional but you can also sprinkle other things, like pine nuts, etc.<br>* Sprinkle paprika on the top (gives it that punch)<br>* Serve with warm pita or mountain bread (if you can find it).<br><br>Leftovers?  Stir and then just repeat the process with the drizzled olive oil, sprinkled chick peas, and paprika - serve (unless it is just for yourself, then just go for it).<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>Edit<colon> I received a PM asking if I would share my recipe.  Here it is... this is for a single serving for two, size up as needed<colon><br><br>* 1 cup chickpeas<br>* Juice from 2 to 3 lemons (to taste)<br>* 2-3 cloves of garlic (I like to go heavy on the garlic, so I sometimes use more)<br>* Salt (to taste)<br>* 1/2 cup tahini<br><br>I only add a bit of olive oil at the beginning - just a drizzle, and then either olive oil or the reserved chickpea can liquid, depending on the balance of tastes (you don<sq>t want it too oily, or too dry).</p>",

                "answer": "<p>First off, there are many different kinds of hot dogs in the US. They aren<sq>t all the same. There<sq>s everything from cheap, industrial Oscar Mayer hot dogs to hot dogs made by the local butcher that are handmade with high quality ingredients (many people do not have access to this sadly). Hot dogs are supposed to be made with beef, but pork is sometimes used as well. Most mass produced brands will have several kinds of hot dogs - some marketed as all beef, some as <dq>classic<dq> with no indication of what meat is used, and some that attempt to be even fancier by indicating Angus beef. There<sq>s also a whole host of crazy stuff - hot dogs stuffed with cheese or jalapenos or chili cheese or hot dogs that <dq>plump when you cook <sq>em<dq> - this is America after all so ask and ye shall receive. Hot dogs made from turkey are also marketed because people think that turkey is healthy.<br><br>You<sq>re probably talking about the mass produced stuff when you<sq>re asking about the typical hot dog and it<sq>s ingredients. First off, there is no casing to these mass produced hot dogs. And second off, the ingredients list is what you<sq>d expect from a mass produced product. Here<sq>s Oscar Mayer<sq>s <dq>classic<dq> hot dog<colon><br><br>> INGREDIENTS<colon> MECHANICALLY SEPARATED CHICKEN, MECHANICALLY SEPARATED TURKEY, WATER, PORK, CORN SYRUP, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2<percent> OF MODIFIED CORNSTARCH, SALT, SODIUM PHOSPHATES, SODIUM DIACETATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, SODIUM ASCORBATE, FLAVOR, SODIUM NITRITE.<br><br>Are they similar to a frankfurter? I would say they are related but these mass produced hot dogs aren<sq>t really like the sausages you get in Germany. There is no snap from the casing and hot dogs are much more emulsified than a frankfurter. The hot dog is emulsified like a mortadella is emulsified - very smooth. They are much closer to the Vienna sausage, which has a lighter casing and is smoother.<br><br>In terms of how they are cooked - they are very often boiled. Some places will even deep fry them until they burst (these are called <dq>rippers<dq> because of the big tear it makes in the hot dog). Whenever I make them at home, I grill them on the grill, typically alongside hamburgers in the summer months. That is the absolute best way to eat a hot dog. Skewering them on a stick you found and crudely sharpened to cook the dog over a fire while camping is tied for <dq>absolute best way<dq> to eat a hot dog in my opinion as well.<br><br>As for condiments, I like to keep it simple and just use good quality mustard. However, I do like Chicago style hot dogs when I<sq>m in Chicago and [they have a ton of toppings](https<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_hot_dog). There<sq>s a lot of technique to eating a Chicago dog with all the toppings without dropping anything or getting too messy.

                "answer": "<p>It<sq>s not the same. While the fat and lean content of meat is tested (in select batches) and regulated, those numbers on the package are not the only difference in the package. You have to remember that not all lean is the same. The fatty sections of a chunk of beef actually are made up of fat suspended in a matrix of collagen and other proteins That<sq>s why when you render liquid fat from what looks like pure beef fat, you still end up with a crispy deflated <dq>shell<dq> of proteins, or the reason why the fat cap on a rib roast doesn<sq>t completely melt away when you cook it.<br><br>So ground meat with a higher fat content also has a higher concentration of collagen and other connective proteins in its lean content. This can have an effect on the final texture of a dish, even after the fat is drained. Very lean ground meat will taste a little dryer and more granular and produce thinner sauces, while fattier cuts will produce gelatin as it cooks, giving you richer, more mouth-coating end results. This is true *even if* you drain off 100<percent> of the fat from both batches because the leftover lean is not identical.<br><br>EDIT<colon> forgot to give the actual practical advice<colon> if this is for a long-cooked dish like chili or something like that, you should buy the cheaper higher fat beef and just drain if you<sq>re concerned about the fat. You<sq>ll end up with about the same amount of fat, but you<sq>ll have better texture because the connective tissue breaks down and adds gelatin. If you<sq>re cooking a quick dish (say, under 45 minutes of simmering), then the connective tissue might not break down sufficiently to add body, but you should still end up with slightly more tasty, less dry end results. Only buy the really lean stuff if you<sq>re making meatloaf or hamburgers or something else you can<sq>t drain and are really concerned about fat intake.</p>",

Most dishes will definitely be compatible, but you have to keep in mind there will be more fat in the result.<br><br>After an equal amount of cooking, the higher fat ground beef will still contain more fat, even if the fat was drained off. Even in ground meat, there is texture to the meat and fat is integrated in that meat. To fully render out fatty ground meat to get to the same fat level as the leaner meat, you would need to significantly overcook it and this would make the meat mealy and unappetizing.</p>",

Add water until you have one fingertip<sq>s height of water above the rice level. (Finger goes in perpendicular to surface of rice, add water until it reaches first crease in finger just after the knuckle.) Perfect amount of water every time. Failing that, cook it like pasta and drain the excess water.<br><br>4. Cooking pasta? Salt the water until it tastes like fresh sea water. Use a *lot* of water. (No such thing as too much.) Get a really good rolling boil.<br><br>5. Baking? Go buy a small digital scale and a larger baker<sq>s scale with a set of weights (up to approx 5lb). Buy a baking textbook or commercial baking formula book that lists recipes with weights. Your results just went up 1000<percent> in quality.<br><br>6. Deep frying? Unless you have a commercial fryer with 5 gallons of oil, heat your oil 25-50 degrees F above your desired frying temp before adding the product. The extra heat will aid in recovering the temperature and keep your product from getting soggy due to insufficient frying temperature.<br><br>7. Speaking of temperature reduction, are you baking with a convection oven (e.g. gas or electric with fan)? Drop the temps 25-50 degrees F. The increased efficiency of heat transfer due to the airflow will overcook your product if the recipe wasn<sq>t designed for a convection oven.<br><br>8. Stop measuring things! Unless you<sq>re baking you should go by taste. Only use measurements when you<sq>re trying to recreate a recipe from someone else. Eventually you get a feel for quantities.<br><br>9. Before you throw a bunch of a powerful spice or seasoning into your entire dish, take a small amount out and season it separately. If it tastes good then scale up the seasoning for the entire amount. If you don<sq>t like it you<sq>re only out a small portion. Much easier to get the taste you want without having to cover up the tracks of your mistakes.<br><br>10. Storing tomato sauce or other stain-prone things in plastic containers? Wipe a little vegetable oil inside the container first. No stains! (Also works great when microwaving in plastic.)</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Whoohoo, something obscure I<sq>ve researched! I teach classes on medieval crafts, including cheesemaking. <br><br>Most cheese is (and always has been) made with true rennet, obtained from the stomach linings of calves that are still nursing (as they age, their stomachs stop producing the enzyme, which helps them break down milk nutrients). <br><br>However, in some places vegetable rennet was used. It can be obtained from various sources, including milkweeds (I<sq>ve made cheese that way!), but the most popular vegetable rennet source is known as (ready?) <dq>rennet<dq>, a.k.a. cleavers, a.k.a. bedstraw - Galium aperine is its Linnaean name.<br><br>The flowers of cleavers are yellow, and produce a strong yellow dye which is useful for dying cloth. If you gather enough cleavers in the summer to make cheese, you<sq>ll almost certainly gather a lot of the flowers - and your cheese will come out extra yellowish. Specifically, in England the Cheshire region used cleavers to curdle their milk for cheese, and by the late Middle Ages Cheshire cheese was already a well-known product.<br><br>But the choice of rennet really doesn<sq>t affect the taste at all - (IIRC) it only takes 1 part rennet to curdle 20,000 parts milk (or something like that), and most of it runs off in the whey, anyway.<br><br>So why did people like the extra-yellow cheese of Cheshire? Human perception. Some colors actually make food <dq>taste<dq> better, *in every measurable way*, to people who are allowed to see the colors (obv it hsa no effect in the dark). Red & yellow foods taste better than white, blue, gray, or brown, foods. And Cheshire cheese was a buttery yellow. (See? We even have an adjective that means both <dq>tasty<dq> and <dq>yellow<dq>!)<br><br>TL/DR<colon> Since the Middle Ages (at least!), because yellow food is more appealing.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Chinese-American here.  Boy is there a lot of stuff to talk about.<br><br>First, veggies.  Obviously there are a lot of different green veggies at the market, from Yu Choy to Bok Choy to Napa Cabbage.  Almost all of these can be basically cooked in a stir-fry of some sort<colon> heat up oil in a wok, pour in washed & cut veggies, salt, stir-fry until wilted, serve.  There is an important caveat<colon> many Chinese markets have very cheap but half bad veggies.  Napa Cabbage can last months in your fridge, but most other things will need to be cleared out in days.  Make sure you wash thoroughly.<br><br>Second, tofu.  In addition to the commonly seen soft and hard tofu, there<sq>s silken tofu, dried tofu, fried tofu, ready-to-eat dried tofu snacks, and a lot more.  Fried tofu is one of my favorites.  They come in yellow squares, usually, and are somewhat hollow on the inside.  Drop them into a brothy soup and they<sq>ll just absorb all of that soupy goodness.<br><br>Third, sauces.  I don<sq>t even personally eat half the sauces available because they<sq>re from other parts of Asia, but I<sq>ll quickly cover soy sauces here.  I use lite soy sauce mostly as a replacement for salt, whether in stir-fry or anything else.  I particularly use it as a marinade for meats along with some rice cooking wine (Shaotsing wine is all I ever use).  Dark soy sauce I use for color, because it<sq>s less salty.  It has a bit more complex flavor than the lite soy sauce, so I also avoid using it if I<sq>m afraid of overpowering natural flavors.  I<sq>m a Kimlan guy.<br><br>Fourth, noodles.  I feel kinda strongly on this one<colon> why use instant ramen that cook in ~3 minutes when normal dried noodles cooks in 6?  It really doesn<sq>t save you much time, and with other dried noodles you can customize the taste of the soup to your liking, avoid horrible amount of sodium, and pick different types of noodles as a bonus.  There are thick rice noodles, thin rice noodles, long & thin wheat noodles, long & fat wheat noodles, buckwheat noodles, whatever.  Alternatively to the dried noodles, some Asian markets have fresh noodles in cling wrap.  These have a bite to them that dried goods just can<sq>t match.  I usually have some neck/rib bone stock in the fridge, but a plain soup of soy sauce and pepper goes a long way.<br><br>Fifth, meats.  Three cuts often don<sq>t show up in Western markets<colon> ribs sliced down the center, bones of various kinds, and pork belly.  Both back ribs and spare ribs can be cut longitudinally, i.e. lots of pieces about an inch thick that all have bones.  There are a variety of dishes that use these, but the easiest is basically boil them in a soup for a few hours, and the meat<sq>ll fall off the bone.  The neck bones, chicken carcasses, etc. can be used to make stock.  Pork belly is bacon before it<sq>s cured.  Sometimes it has the skin, sometimes not, but the uses are endless.  You can broil slices in the oven in some soy sauce for a quick version of roast pork that lots of ramen places use.  You can cut them into squares and braise in soy sauce & water for a classic dish (google Braised Pork Soy Sauce for more detailed recipes).<br><br>Lastly, hardware.  This is a huge YMMV, but I use steamers, woks, and cleavers, and all are easier to get at Asian markets.  In larger cities, the restaurant supply stores in the Asian neighborhoods are even better, but their grasp of English will tend to be worse.<br><br><br>EDIT<colon><br><br>While cooking dinner, it occurred to me to point out two Asian things I DON<sq>T get at Asian markets<colon> tea and white pepper.  Cheaper Asian brands of tea are as crappy of a tea as Folger<sq>s is for coffee, so I avoid them for higher end tea vendors in my area.  White pepper too, often have MSG or salt.  Please check the ingredient list!  I often end up saving myself time and get pure white pepper from American shops.<br><br>Also a quick word on rice<colon> rice the world around is pretty much the same<colon> shorter grains are starchier, longer grains are fluffier, and brown rice still has the hull attached.  All cook in the rice cooker pretty much the same.</p>",

Quick search from wolframalpha shows a chicken breast (212 g) as having 12 g of fat, or 30<percent> of calories, 5 wt<percent> from fat. Beef (85 g) has 11 g of fat, or 50<percent> of its calories, 13 wt<percent> from fat. That<sq>s a pretty significant difference, and considering mayo is basically pure fat, you<sq>re adding something to the chicken that<sq>s not there in the beef, and adding something to the beef that it doesn<sq>t really need, per se.<br><br>I would extend that this is why mayo and beef on a sandwich is okay- you have a lot of other components to make the taste and fat content something palatable. Additionally, mayo is very stable as an emulsion, which makes its texture distinct from other fats (olive oil, butter, etc) which do quite nicely (if you don<sq>t add a little butter to your steak as its resting, give it a try!

                "answer": "<p>At the risk of exposing my amateur cook status, I<sq>ll tell you how I categorize sauces in my head. You<sq>ve probably already come across the 5 mother sauces from French cooking, and those cover most everything, but it can take a bit to work down through them to sauces you<sq>re actually familiar with and can use.<br><br>So, here<sq>s how I think of sauces<colon><br><br>1. Pan sauces<br>2. Roux based sauces<br>3. Emulsified sauces (mayonaise, hollandaise, beurre blanc)<br>4. Compound butters (not really a sauce, but often fill the same role)<br>5. Vinaigrettes<br>6. Tomato sauces<br>7. Other sauces<br><br>Here are very basics of each and when you<sq>d use them<colon><br><br>* **Pan sauces**<br><br>You make this in the pan you cooked your meat in. First, remove the meat and put the pan over medium to medium high heat. You probably don<sq>t need to, but if necessary add a little oil. Put in your aromatics, like diced onion, shallots, garlic and cook until translucent. Then use something acidic to deglaze (scrape up the brown bits). This is usually wine, but you can also use white or red wine vinegar, stock mixed with lemon juice, or another acid. Cook off the alcohol a couple minutes, then add some stock and reduce until thickened, generally to the point where if you scrape the spoon across the bottom of the pan it leaves a little trail (i.e., the liquid doesn<sq>t rush back and cover it up right away). You can finish with some butter or a little cream if a cream sauce, both of which will thicken it a little and give it that velvety mouth feel. Add any chopped fresh herbs like parsely at the end.<br><br>* **Roux based sauces**<br><br>A roux is a mixture of equal parts fat and flour. The fat is usually butter, but you can also use oil. Put over heat, add in the flour and stir more or less constantly until it thickens and loses the raw flour taste. Roux<sq>s can be light, medium or dark. The darker the roux, the nuttier the flavor. A light roux is used to make bechamel (basic white sauce). Add milk to a light roux. Traditional bechamel also has a little nutmeg. To this, you can add grated cheese to make a cheese sauce, or use the plain sauce in dishes like lasagna. A roux is also the starting point for lots of other sauces (brown or white veloute, which is basically beef or chicken stock, respectively, added to a roux, works as the basis for tons of different sauces). Roux can also be the starting point for whole dishes too, like a lot of creole / cajun dishes.<br><br>Another related option is to use a cornstarch slurry near the end (mix cornstarch with room temperature or cold liquid, then stir into hot liquid) instead of a roux at the beginning to thicken a sauce. Generally you want to avoid this for savory sauces because it gives it a glossy sheen (although cooking at home I tend not to care and sometimes do this if my sauce is too thin and I don<sq>t want to wait for it to reduce). It is common to make gravies with cornstarch.<br><br>* **Emulsified sauces**<br><br>These have already been covered by others better, but this is a sauce made by using an emulsifier to thicken like eggs, butter or mustard. For an aioli, mix aromatics and an acid like vinegar or lemon juice together with the egg yolks then slowly add the oil while beating. Hollandaise is trickier and requires cooking over low heat (usually with a double broiler) while you add the butter to the egg yolk and lemon juice mixture. Beurre blanc uses butter as the emulsifier added to wine, sometimes stock and lemon juice and is cooked over heat, similar to a pan sauce except you<sq>re stirring constantly as you slowly add the butter.<br><br>* **Compound butters**<br><br>These are easiest and go great over roast or grilled meat or fish. Mash up some herbs, aromatics and/or seasoning into a cold stick of butter with your mortar and pestle or just in a bowl with a spoon, then wrap in wax paper or plastic wrap, mold back into a stick and refrigerate. A simple compound butter is an herb lemon butter, some diced garlic, some fresh thyme or whatever other herbs you want, some salt, some pepper, a little bit of lemon juice. Another good one is some chopped canned chipotles, some lime zest / lime juice and some honey. Keeping a few sticks of different compound butters in your fridge is a great way to shortcut to a good dinner.<br><br>* **Vinaigrettes**<br><br>These are really easy<colon> 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, then add in whatever other herbs and spices you want. Most salad dressings are vinaigrettes. These are easy because all you need to do is mix it all together and shake vigorously, like it says on the bottle. Also usually make good marinades.<br><br>* **Tomato sauces**<br><br>These are sauces made low and slow with mirepoix and usually some bacon or pancetta to start, then some wine usually, stock, and some tomatoes, usually tomato paste but you could also use tomato sauce and/or diced tomatoes, and again whatever herbs you want.<br><br>* **Other sauces**<br><br>Don<sq>t really have a good name for these. For some sauces, you basically just mix everything together and sometimes apply heat. BBQ sauce is a good example of this. Pesto is another one, one that you don<sq>t apply heat to. Sometimes you<sq>ll have a <dq>chunky<dq> sauce and then throw it into the blender and puree it to thicken it up. I<sq>m sure these all belong in their own categories or there<sq>s a name for them that I don<sq>t know, but here<sq>s where I<sq>m sticking them.<br><br>-----<br><br>You probably noticed stock was involved in most of these. You need stock, and most store bought stocks are terrible. Some purists will insist you make your own, and it<sq>s definitely worth doing at least a few times, but for a home cook it can be a bit of a burden. In my opinion, Kitchen Basics makes the best store-bought stock, particularly their chicken stock.<br><br>-----<br><br>Ok, I<sq>m sure I made all kinds of mistakes and left some important things out (I have done very little cooking with asian or middle eastern cuisine so I know that<sq>s missing), so the people in this subreddit that actually know how to cook should feel free to correct anything I said. I remember when I first started cooking it blew my mind that Alfredo sauce, my favorite at the time (hey, I was 17, can you blame me?) was only [butter and cheese.](http<colon>//www.food.com/recipe/alfredos-of-romes-original-fettuccine-alfredo-187391) (although you should note most <dq>alfredo<dq> sauces you<sq>ll encounter here in the U.S. are some kind of bechamel). I always thought there must be some secret to it, and while truly great sauces do require a lot of skill and can and do make or break a dish, they<sq>re not nearly as intimidating once you get the basics down.<br><br>This is completely unrelated, but you made me think about when I first started cooking<colon> bite into some parsley. Then try to search for that taste next time you make a sauce that calls for it. Big <dq>ah ha<dq> moment for me as I finally realized what the point of parsley was. In fact, do this for all the basic ingredients you cook with, even the unpleasant ones like vinegar or raw flour. Taste stuff as it cooks too. It<sq>ll help you know what ingredients do what and how your cooking changes and blends the different flavors together.</p>",

Mustard and eggs are traditional and both work really well.  For instance, for your aioli, it<sq>s not just the ingredients, it<sq>s how they<sq>re added.  <br><br>1.  Add everything but the oil.  If you have a blender / food processor, this will make your life easier, but a whisk and a bowl will more than adequately get the job done.  Typically this will be, as you note, something aromatic / acidic, and ideally an emulsifier, like egg yolk or mustard or somesuch.  Salt and pepper too because why not.  <br><br>This is the important step.  Next, while blending/whisking, slowly (SLOWLY!) add the oil, as in a drop at a time.  Combine until it is fully combined.  Then add another couple drops.  Combine.  Then another couple, always blending / whisking.  Combine.  After the first teaspoon or so, you can add a little more quickly, but you can<sq>t go wrong adding the oil slowly.  By adding the oil slowly, the emulsification will hold and you will be a happy camper.  No more things floating in oil!<br><br>You will be <sq>done<sq> when all of the sudden the mixture gets thick, about the consistency of mayo.  Because that<sq>s pretty much what you<sq>ve just made.  <br><br>Now it<sq>s interesting to note that if you blend furiously enough, you can combine lots of things that otherwise wouldn<sq>t combine well, but they<sq>ll still be subject to breaking later on.  <br><br>With scrambled eggs, you have a lot of egg and a little flavoring, so the eggs, Nature<sq>s little miracle, incorporate everything A-OK.

It goes on to define a sauce as usually being made up of<br><br>> 1. A liquid, the body of the sauce<br>> 2. A thickening agent<br>> 3. Additional season and flavoring ingredients<br><br>In Western French cuisine, there is the concept of *leading sauces* (aka *mother sauces*), which form the basis of almost all other sauces, for example, b\u00e9chamel and brown sauce (*espagnole*). Some of those sauces that a lot of time and care to produce, some (like b\u00e9chamel) are very simple to make. If you can make a roux, you have  a starting point for a lot of sauces.<br><br>While classic continental cooking uses thickeners such as starches (as in a *roux*) and tomato paste (a natural thickener), in South-Asian cooking (eg., Indian/Pakistani), sauces are often made by pur\u00e9eing ingredients in a blender, using vegetables as natural thickeners. Indian cooking uses heavily onion-based <dq>leading sauces<dq> to create curries. For example, fry up onions with oil and water (possibly vegs like cabbage, carrots, tomatoes) and spices (ginger in particular is pretty much omnipresent) until the onions are soft, then pur\u00e9e together with lots of water. (I should add that this sauce base does not in itself taste very good.) To make the actual dish, use the base sauce and add more spices specific to the dish, and for additional depth add things like stock, cream, coconut milk and/or butter.</p>",

Also, letting the salt sit on the surface of the meat for a while will pull water soluble proteins out, which will aid the Maillard reaction, which makes foods turn brown and get even more tasty.</p>",

Use a big pot and a gallon of water for each pound of pasta. The more water you use, the faster the pot comes back to a boil after adding the noodles.

                "answer": "<p>There are some old urban myths appearing in this thread, maybe it would be useful to step back for a second and discuss the purpose of oil in your food so we understand *why* we cook with it.<br><br>**The short version<colon> For the vast majority of cooking, the oil in your pan is used primarily for the purpose of conducting heat from the pan into the food. The only thing that really matters is that the oil is hot enough to start cooking when you introduce food to the oiled pan.**<br><br>Heat transfers through three different modes<colon> conduction (direct contact), convection (a volume of hot air or liquid passing over it) and radiation (think broiler or glowing coals in a grill). When you<sq>re cooking in a pan, almost all of the heat transfer is through conduction, a tiny bit through convection, and essentially none as radiation.<br><br>Oil<sq>s purpose in this environment is to assist in conduction of heat from the pan into the food.<br><br>Imagine for a second that you have a totally dry stainless steel pan, and you threw in for example, julienned bell peppers, with no oil. How do you think the peppers will cook? Depending on how they landed, different pieces will have different amount of physical contact with the pan. If you leave it as is and let it cook until browning then remove the peppers, you<sq>ll find lots of little browned/scorched spots where the peppers made good contact with the pan, and nearly raw pepper where it didn<sq>t make good contact with the pan.<br><br>Even for a very good pan and a flat food (let<sq>s say, a steak) you still get very imperfect contact between the hot pan and the cold food. Go ahead and try to sear a steak in your best pan with no oil and see what happens. Even the most precisely cut steak isn<sq>t totally flat, and the pan itself has tons of little microscopic valleys and crannies on it too.<br><br>Oil is a viscous liquid that conducts heat fairly well and doesn<sq>t boil away like water. So when you introduce it to the pan, it can heat up to the same temperature as the pan, and it can fill all the little gaps between your food and the pan. It compensates for the poor contact between food and pan.<br><br>Another key advantage of cooking oil is that it can prevent food from sticking to stainless steel pans. There are some urban myths about *why* this is, such as <dq>oil is slippery<dq> (which is a factor but not the biggest one), some nonsense about steam coming out of food, and other nonsense about pans being temporarily <dq>cured<dq> like a cast iron pan. The real reason is that the oil can set surface proteins on your food before the food makes full contact directly with the pan.<br><br>Think about egg whites for a moment; they<sq>re liquid, but when sufficiently heated they solidify into whatever shape they were when they hit the critical temperature. At a microscopic level, even the smoothest pan is actually pretty rough and textured. Ignoring non-stick pans for a moment, when you cook an egg directly on the pan, you can think of the whites as basically setting up in exactly the shape and contour of the pan on that microscopic level. So there<sq>s a large surface where the egg and pan fit together like lego bricks and that egg isn<sq>t going to want to move.<br><br>If your pan contains hot oil before you introduce the egg, the egg isn<sq>t directly hitting the pan, it<sq>s hitting the hot oil first. If you do it right, the outermost proteins on that egg will set up before they reach the pan itself. Now you have an egg whose shape *doesn<sq>t* match that of the pan, and there<sq>s a slippery layer of oil between it and the pan. No sticking! If the oil was not hot enough to set the outermost proteins, the egg will sink right through and stick to the pan as it cooks.<br><br>Darn near all proteins you cook are to some extent like the egg on a microscopic level. Fish in particular contains a ton of albumin that sets up similarly to egg whites (this is the white stuff that comes out of your salmon when you cook it). If your oil is sufficiently hot, there<sq>s no opportunity for the surface proteins to adhere to the pan. This is why you want to hear the food *sizzle* when it goes into the pan - it<sq>s an indication that the oil is reasonably hot, because it<sq>s hot enough that it<sq>s causing water to rapidly boil off.<br><br>So when you cook, it doesn<sq>t really matter if the oil went into the pan when it was hot or cold, so long as (1) the oil is hot enough to start cooking when you add the food and (2) the oil isn<sq>t so hot that it<sq>s burning.</p>",

Buy some chocolate here. I can guarantee that it is top notch. You<sq>ll notice that the store looks like a jewelry store. I<sq>ll let you guess why. The Fiat brand chocolate is delicious (their chocolate spread kicks Nutella<sq>s ass). You<sq>ll find also some not-so-expensive stuff here.<br><br>- [Salumeria e Formaggeria](http<colon>//goo.gl/maps/WqH9e) in via Saragozza. They have an ungodly amount of cured meats and cheeses. Unfortunately you can not bring any <dq>ciccioli<dq> or <dq>culatello<dq>, luckily they also have many many cheeses that can only be found in Bologna and Emilia-Romagna. Have fun here.<br><br>- [Eataly Bologna](http<colon>//goo.gl/maps/Bjmb1) in via degli Orefici. It is located at the 2nd floor of Librerie Coop. Here you<sq>ll find probably some of the best products in Emilia Romagna<colon> jams, mustards, conserves, olive oil, vinegar, you name it. It is quite pricey, but the quality of products is fantastic. Eataly is inside Librerie Coop (a bookstore) so feel free to wander around and look at their stuff, nobody will put pressure on you to buy something.<br><br>- In via Caprarie (very near to via degli Orefici) there are [Ditta A. F. Tamburini](http<colon>//goo.gl/maps/RRscJ) and [Pastificio Atti](http<colon>//goo.gl/maps/LHq0A) (the most ancient pastificio in Bologna). They both sell some of the best handmade tortellini in Bologna (and Bologna is the place where tortellini were invented, so it<sq>s a safe bet to say that they are probably some of the best in the world, literally) and a lot of other cheeses and sauces.<br><br>Now, the less expensive, still very good, stuff that you can buy in most supermarkets (such as Pam in via Marconi)<colon><br><br>- Pasta. I suggest brands Garofalo, De Cecco, Del Verde. Italian Barilla is better than American Barilla, but there<sq>s not a lot of difference. Be aware that Voiello and Barilla are basically the same pasta sold with different brands.<br><br>- Non-ultra-expensive balsamic vinegar. <dq>True<dq> balsamic vinegar from Modena (<dq>aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena) is crazy expensive (it<sq>s easily more than \u20ac50 for 100ml). However, you can buy some that is not that expensive and is still very good. Right now I am using <dq>Aceto Balsamico di Modena IGP Giuseppe Giusti<dq> (you can recognize it because it is sold in cubic bottles). Roughly, any balsamic vinegar that costs about \u20ac10-15 for 250ml is a mid-tier balsamic vinegar that still is vastly better than any <dq>balsamic vinegar<dq> sold in the U.S. (I know, I tried them). Protip<colon> try a drop of balsamic vinegar on a chip of Parmigiano Reggiano. It<sq>s *terrific*.<br><br>- Sweets<colon> Baci Perugina, Pocket Coffee, Mon Cheries, Ferrero Roch\u00e9.<br><br>- Marzapane<colon> i.e., marzipan. Sicily exports a lot of it and it<sq>s delicious. It is not to be eaten alone, it is usually used to decorate cakes.<br><br>- Birre italiane! Head over to [Birreria Amadeus](http<colon>//www.birreriaamadeus.it/), try some italian beers and buy a bottle or two to bring back home.<br><br>- Liquors<colon> Limoncello, Amaro Montenegro, Amaretto di Saronno, San Marzano Borsci are all good liquors and make great gifts.<br><br>- Wines<colon> well, you<sq>re in Italy.<br><br>PM me if you need any help while in Bologna.</p>",

One of my friends whom own his own well regarded restaurant wont serve steaks below medium rare. His reasoning is that the collagen in the meat wont break down below 58 degrees Celsius and therefore any meat cooked below that doesnt best represent the potential of the steak that he is serving. He buys very premium meat and charges a premium for it and wants to ensure that people get their value for it and not just what they perceive as value. <br><br>The big difference in his case is that hell often come out to the table to make the recommendation to the guest so that they aren<sq>t so much being denied a rare steak as they are following the chef;s recommendation which in the 3 years hes had his place literally noone has ever heard him speak on the issue and then disagreed afterwards. <br><br>Now just because the collagen reaches 58 degrees doesn<sq>t mean it all melts away otherwise the steak would have the texture of pulled brisket but we<sq>ve done side by sides and he does have me convinced there is validity to his opinion. </p>",

To pick them up for service, all you have to do is fry until crispy, which is about 6 minutes. Sometimes when we get really slammed and need a bunch at once, we<sq>ll do another blanch at 350-360F to get them almost all the way done, then flash them for another minute or two at the same temperature to get them crispy. This method is pretty solid, but the timing of everything with depend on the thickness of your fries (we do steak fries that are about 1/4x1/4).<br><br>2. Our veggie burger is lentil based with mushrooms, kale, and a few other goodies. If you start with lentils or another starchy bean, use a 1.5<colon>1 ratio of cooked beans to cooked beans that have been run through a food processor. This should give you the starch you need to hold it together and also keep some of the texture of the original product.<br><br>3. Keep your options open. If your tomato-mayo sauce is awesome, definitely keep it on the menu. Work on a variety of different sauces and  feel the crowd with them. The customers will let you know what works and what doesn<sq>t. That being said, it would be safe to assume that not a lot of people would be interested in a durian glazed fish burger, for example. Personally, I don<sq>t like a lot of sauce on my burgers. If you have good meat, good cheese, good bacon and a good bun, I would much prefer to taste all of that than to have another sauce on top of it. A really nice house-made ketchup or a small schmear of whole grain mustard would be more than enough in my book.</p>",

More often than not, it<sq>s substandard or(at best) pretty average stuff.  A lot of places use rented knives that get replaced every week.  Serviceable, yes, but it<sq>s been my experience with those knives that come the end of their cycle, cutting just about anything can be a chore.  In kitchens where it<sq>s customary to bring your own knives, I<sq>ve seen a pretty wide range.  Lots of cheap, reliable Victorianox blades.  A pretty decent amount of the standard level Wustoff, Zwilling, and Shun.  I<sq>ve only known a few pros that brought in the higher end steel such as a Shun Reserve(got a painful story about one of those) or a Miyabi.  Personally, my go to 8<dq> was(and still is) a Kussi Kata which is a slightly less expensive version of the Shun Classic.  The reason you won<sq>t see the top dollar stuff in a restaurant is because knives and pretty much all other equipment will take a serious beating.  That sexy little $500 Miyabi is going to take some serious abuse from its owner and any other schmuck crass enough to grab another man<sq>s knife.

And it looks sexy as fuck in my opinion.  I<sq>ve also got one of the Shun 12th anniversary chef<sq>s knives with the layers of copper throughout the blade.  A little less use, but sharp as a scalpel and still sexy as fuck.  I<sq>d never let either of those see the inside of a professional kitchen, but I<sq>m pretty happy to have them at home.

The FDA/USDA time/temperature guidelines for cooking various cuts of meat assume that the meat has not been temperature abused to the point where E. coli can run away and start growing. The fact is if your meat is rife with heat stable toxins from E. coli or other Enterobacteriaceae then it wasn<sq>t safe to begin with and it was held at an abuse temperature for too long.<br><br>You have to use quality as your first benchmark. If a cut looks funny and/or smells funny then there<sq>s something off with it.

                "answer": "<p>As /u/onioning stated, you should kill the majority of bacteria through heating meats to the recommended temperatures. However, some bacteria produce toxins which then permeate the meat. Some toxins are broken down by cooking, others are not. A common example is E. coli, which in the US may commonly be encountered in beef. E. coli produces a heat stable toxin, so the longer an infected piece of beef goes before being cooked, the more bacteria breed and the more toxin they produce. Once cooked, the bacteria are killed but the toxin remains in the meat and is able to make you sick. <br><br>As a final note, different meats have different bacterias prevalent in them. This helps shape part of the reason that different meats have differing recommendations for cooking temps (i.e. the bacteria that commonly infect meat A may be able to withstand higher temps than the bacteria commonly found in meat B).</p>",

I agree with their view with the consideration that they are so similar in flavor profile that they can be indistinguishable at times.

Here<sq>s how you make your pancake delicious<colon><br><br>a.  sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, sugar if you want to.  For 2 cups flour, I like about 2 tsp baking powder, ~ .5 tsp (maybe a little more) soda, a healthy pinch of salt, and maybe 2 tb sugar.  You sift because you want to facilitate incorporation of wet to dry once you<sq>ve made your wet and dense flour and clumps of baking powder are not delicious.  <br><br>b.  melt about 1/2 stick of butter.  incorporate two eggs.  Then, and only then, add about 2 cups buttermilk.  <br><br>c.  Add wet to dry.  Stir / whisk / whatever promptly and gently, working only enough to get rid of major lumps.  Some lumps will remain.  That<sq>s OK.  <br><br>d.  Thinly thinly add some butter to the pan.  Add to hot pan/griddle/whatevs.  How hot?  When you drop water on it, the drop shouldn<sq>t just sit there; it should move.  <br><br>e.  test test and test some more.  Batter too thick?  Add more buttermilk.  Batter too thin?

Fuck outta here.<br><br> We use a mix of parmesan and pecorino.  Black pepper is important but don<sq>t overdo it.  We use our pig fat from when we prepare the Guanciale.  Mix these ingredients together in a metal bowl so the cheese incorporates with the egg and pepper nicely (you are gonna need to cream them, double boiler style)<br><br> the way we do it is boil the pasta in heavily salted water. (i prefer a larger noodle instead of spaghetti (more sauce, we use bombolloti) when the pasta is about 30 seconds away from perfect al dente put the mixing bowl over the pasta boiler and begin to cream the sauce.  If it is too thick add some of the starchy (and salted!) pasta water to the mix til it gets a proper consistency.  DONT LET THE EGGS SCRAMBLE.  if the bowl gets too hot pull it off for 5 seconds and keep stirring the mixture.  <br><br>When its off the fire is always a good time to add the liquid so it doesn<sq>t get too hot and overcook.  Then back on the boiler right away.  When it is almost perfect, pull the pasta mix it in and keep stirring over the boiler til it is a thick cream that nicely coats the pasta.  Always add small amounts of water at a time, you can always add more later but if you add too much you<sq>ll have to cook longer and likely overdo the sauce or lose your flavor.<br><br>We top with cubed guanciale but pancetta should work fine too. just make sure it is thick not that thinly sliced deli bullshit.<br><br>if your flavor is the issue maybe use a better cheese, try pecorino for sure they mix well. salted water and pepper... usually the problem is consistency not flavor.<br><br>Also make sure to serve on a warm plate.

With carbonara, there<sq>s very limited opportunity to season after the pasta is cooked since you really have to serve immediately, so making sure the pasta is cooked in well-salted water is very important.

It<sq>s a very fine balancing act that simply takes practice (and maybe a bit of luck) to add them when the pasta is hot enough to warm them to the point of thickening into a sauce without scrambling. Make sure your eggs are very well beaten before adding them in. A touch of cream beaten into the eggs will help protect them from scrambling, but the benefit is pretty minor so don<sq>t expect miracles.</p>",

Feel free to add peppercorns, bay leaves, herbs, cloves, whatever, but salt and sugar are musts.<br><br>My first recommendation would be to spatchcock (or butterfly) the bird. Depending on the size of the grill, you may want to just halve the bird completely down the center. <br><br>Olive oil, minced garlic, minced rosemary, some black pepper--aaaalllll over this bird. And under the skin. If you<sq>ve rinsed your bird after brining, a light application of salt on the skin would be welcome.<br><br>Is your grill charcoal or gas? All of my experience is with charcoal, but I can make some educated guesses towards gas grills. With charcoal, you<sq>ll want to light a full chimney<sq>s worth of coals, then bank these coals along one side of the grill<sq>s walls. With this same technique and a chicken, I usually leave the coals spread evenly, place the bird skin-side-down for a few minutes to brown it, then remove the bird, bank the coals, and replace. I think with a turkey, it<sq>s going to be too heavy/too much work. You<sq>re welcome to give it a go, though. <br><br>Lay the turkey, skin-side-down, on the grill, such that the breasts are *farthest away* from the coals, and the drumsticks/thighs are closer. Keep an eye on the skin, and flip it after it starts to look good and brown (probably 15 minutes). If you<sq>re good, you should be able to fool with the vents to keep it around 400-450. If so, my guess is that the whole thing would take an hour, maybe an hour-15. Keep your eye on your grill temp, and the meat temp--180 at the thigh, 160 at the breast. <br><br>For a gas grill (assuming a three zone), I would choose High-Medium-Low, and keep the thighs over the medium heat and the breast over the low heat. <br><br>Alternatively, you could braise the turkey. Cooks<sq> Illustrated has claimed to have a lot of success with braising turkeys, and while it<sq>s easier in the oven (IMO), it<sq>s possible on the stove. <br><br>Quarter the turkey (butterfly it, and then separate the thigh/drumstick section from the breast/wing section). Arrange aromatic vegetables in a metal roasting pan--garlic, onions, carrots, celery, wild mushrooms (yeah they<sq>re not all technically aromatic, shut up)--along with some fresh herbage--thyme, rosemary, and bay work well. Place the meat skin-side-up on the vegetables, and cover with a white wine/chicken stock mixture (1<colon>1) until the liquid comes up 3/4 of the way to the top of the meat. Tent with aluminum foild, set on medium heat for *probably* around 2 hours--maybe more. Check your temperatures as noted above. <br><br>You *could* choose to brown the turkey pieces, skin side down, on a separate pan before laying in the roasting dish. it would definitely enhance the dish, but stove-space tends to be at a premium on Thanksgiving. <br><br>Let us know how it comes out!</p>",

                "answer": "<p>The country of origin probably isn<sq>t the problem, the issue most likely lies with both the <sq>solidness<sq> and the <sq>wetness<sq> of the food you<sq>re eating and how you eat it, accordingly. An example to illustrate mexican food is a taco. A spicy taco is fairly dry. You can load it up with chili sauce but it only coats the surface of what is a lot of fairly solid matter. As you chew some of the neutral food absorbs the chilli, while some acts as an abrasive, scrubbing capsaicin off of your tongue. Compare that to a very hot thai tom yum soup. Here the chili concentration is high and it<sq>s dispersed throughout the food. The soup base is also mostly water, with few abrasive or absorbative ingredients. <br><br>Soup also takes a long time to cool down compared to say, a taco. Chilies don<sq>t exactly work by making you feel pain as if it were heat, they instead work by lowering the temperature at which your nerves send out a pain signal from heat. This means instead of waiting until ~60 C to send a pain signal, your tongue now sends pain signals at ~20 C, way below body temperature. The taco, once it<sq>s been left for a few minutes is pretty cool, which means by your second one you<sq>re not going to be receiving quite as many pain signals. The soup however stays very hot for a lot longer. As you drink it, your tongue warms up and stays hot, meaning your tongue registers far stronger pain signals from the same amount of capsaicin.<br><br>In combination to the above two effects, spicy broths tend to flick around your face as you slurp them, a lot more than a taco would. Slurping noodles in particular ends up with a lot of spice broth on your chin if you aren<sq>t careful, which further increases your perception of how spicy the food is.</p>",

[Ikejime](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikejime) is a technique used to kill the fish.  The more the fish fight and expend their energy, the less likely their meat will taste as good as it can.  And then there<sq>s always the chance of the flesh tearing(which simply isn<sq>t good presentation).<br><br>The other important difference is that you want to only deal with the fish before or after rigor mortis.  Aside from the fact it<sq>s kind of hard to get a fish before rigor starts to set in, most places prefer having their fish slightly aged.  You don<sq>t go as far as with say, steak, but it<sq>s pretty necessary.  Very fresh tuna tends to have a very strong taste and be pretty tough(and some people even complain that it tastes like it<sq>s really old).

I wouldn<sq>t even bother buying a whole fish, unless you have enough people to eat it all within 24 hours. I would suggest going to a reputable fishmonger in your area (yelp?) and telling them you are going to be making sushi and eating the fish raw. Alternatively the frozen <sq>steaks<sq> from wholesale clubs or trader joes are generally very high quality. If money is no object and you<sq>re into planning ahead you can check out [Catalina Offshore Products] (http<colon>//www.catalinaop.com/) <br>The best ways to determine freshness are *Color<colon>* it should be bright and vibrant, not grey and faded. *Smell<colon>* fresh fish does not smell fishy, it should smell like the ocean, fresh and a little salty. If it smells like fish or low tide, don<sq>t eat it raw. *Texture<colon>* The fish should spring right back when you poke it, if your finger leaves a lasting indent the fish it not at optimal freshness. <br><br>>I want to know what are some guidelines if I wanted to make Sushi often, how much rice can I store and for how long? <br><br>You can store as much rice as you want, but it will go sour after about 24 hours. The best way to store the rice is in a covered, insulated container (wrap a towel around a dutch oven, perhaps) and if it gets cold to reheat gently in a 200F oven or an airtight container in the microwave.<br><br>>Should I store it at room temperature?<br><br>Yes, in the fridge the rice will clump together and the grains will lose their individuality. If you must do this the best way to bring it back is to sprinkle some water over the rice and microwave in an airtight container (carefully) at about 70<percent> power until its warm. However it will never be as fluffy and cooperative as rice that has not been refrigerated.<br><br>>do I have to buy fish I<sq>m going to use that exact same day? Can I store it? If so, should I store it in the freezer or in the fridge? How long can I store it before it can no longer be used for sushi? If I can freeze it what<sq>s the best method for thawing it?<br><br>If you are buying fresh fish you should use it the same day. NOTE<colon> Salmon always needs to be frozen for 24 hrs, ideally to a temp of -20F to kill parasites. This is only necessary with fish that spend part of their life in freshwater, as salmon do. If you are buying frozen fish you can probably use it for sushi up to 24-48 hours after thawing. The fish will be really unappetizing long before it will hurt you, so if its smelling fishy you can cook it, but prob should<sq>t consume it raw  For storage overnight pat it dry with paper towels and wrap it super tight with at least 2 layers of plastic wrap, squeezing out the air as you wrap. Air is the enemy of fish, the smells and discoloration are a result of oxidation (that super pink tuna? treated with carbon monoxide to drive out all the oxygen from the meat). <br>Officially thawing should be done in the refrigerator overnight, or in cold water that is changed often. Unofficially most sushi restaurants put it on a metal tray at room temp. The issue is bacterial growth, as soon as you remove the fish from the freezer the bacteria stopwatch starts counting, if you thaw at room temp the outside of the fish thaws first and the bacteria start multiplying, if you are not going to consume all the fish right away enough time may elapse for certain bacteria to reach a concentration that may be harmful. So if you are not eating all right away you should probably just thaw what you are going to eat, or thaw it in the fridge and consume the uneaten portion within 24-48 hours. <br><br>>What<sq>s the proper ratio of vinegar/cooked rice I should use? (I always seem to pour too much) <br><br>This is important not just in terms of flavor and texture but also safety, if you are going to store the rice overnight the pH level needs to be correct (around 4.0) in order to inhibit microbial growth. That said the ratio is about 1<colon>2 vinegar<colon>*uncooked* rice. This works out to about 1 cup of vinegar to 3 cups of cooked rice. I think. We always just measured the rice dry.  <br><br>>Also, can someone recommend a good hocho (knife) that<sq>s not ultra-expensive?<br><br>There are so many kinds. A stainless yanagiba for $30-50 can be very effective. It is worth investing in an affordable Japanese waterstone, 5000 grit is good for all around sharpening (another $20-50), even a $300 knife is useless if it is not kept good and sharp.<br><br>Happy Rolling!<br><br>**NOTE None of this is medical/scientific advice, only my experience.

Also for cutting and rolling you always have a bowl of water or water/vinegar mix to keep your hands moist (**always**) and dip your knife between each cut of the maki (**always**)<br><br>EDIT<colon> Thanks for all the interested responses!

But I<sq>m not aware of specific terms to describe most of the flavors you<sq>re referring to.<br><br>The traditional <dq>spicy<dq> flavor stems from a specific compound called capsaicin. Its concentration is also often measured in a unit called the Scoville unit. True peppers (capsicums) as far as I know all derive their heat from capsaicin, hence why jalapenos and habeneros taste like they<sq>re in the same flavor family - they are.<br><br>The pungent nasal burn from wasabi or a strong mustard or horseradish comes from a different compound called allyl isothiocyanate. There is no capsaicin in these foods at all, hence why they taste totally different. I don<sq>t know of a term specifically for this, but chefs will generally know what you<sq>re saying when you phrase something as having a wasabi or mustard burn.<br><br>Pepper, as in the thing that we call black pepper and all of its related peppers, is not a capsicum either and also does not have capsaicin in it. It has a compound called piperine which is responsible for that characteristic burn. Again, not aware of any specific name for it, but people know what black pepper tastes like. There are varieties of pepper too, like the milder white and green peppercorns, and long pepper which tastes similar to black pepper.<br><br>There are others too. The sichuan (or szechuan) peppercorn is not a peppercorn at all but a flower bud that contains hydroxy alpha sanshool which gives your tongue a very bizarre tingling and numbing sensation. Common in sichuanese food like mapo tofu.<br><br>Pink peppercorn looks just like a smooth black peppercorn only pink, but it is actually unrelated. They taste like a mild, fruiter version of a white peppercorn.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Take a deep breath.<br>  <br>I cannot really help you because I have never opened a fast food truck. However, I have started a company so I can help on that side.  <br>  <br>First, make a list of things you need. Better to be over detailed than under. Start with the obvious<colon> Truck (or commercial food property lease). Then break it down; equipment<colon> Fridges, freezers, burners, etc etc. Then break it down more<colon> Tupperware, pots, pans, utensils, whatever. Close your eyes and imagine a day running your food truck and everything you touch, use, see; make a note of it. <br>  <br>From this list, split it into two categories. Capital and Operational. To make it simple, capital is what you buy once; e.g. Truck, pots, pans. Operational is what you need for daily operations; e.g. lettuce, tomatoes, beef, spices, but don<sq>t forget non food items like paper napkins (and plates and plasticware if you plan on using them) as well as overheads like electricity, gas, etc, and don<sq>t forget you salary and other employees wages *and* social costs, medical insurance, etc.  <br>  <br>Now you have your list, put a price tag next to everything. For the capital, just put the price it would cost, and google is your friend for research. For the operational, make an assumption of price per month or price per day, based on the volume you might sell. This is where it starts to get complicated, but take your time.  <br>  <br>Then, build a calendar. Month my month for the first year, and yearly after that. Assume in the first month you buy all your capital, write down those expenses. Now for each month, calculate your operational expenses. To do your operational expenses, you must have made some assumptions on how much you can sell each day, so add the revenue. This starts getting more and more complicated sounding when I write it down like this, but there are a ton of websites that will help you build a business plan - this should get your started.<br>  <br>Let<sq>s take a simple example. I am going to sell cheeseburgers out of  a small shack, take away only so no dining furniture. I will call my business Burgerbarn. (all actual figures are bullshit because I am pulling them out of my bottom burger)<br>  <br>First, I need to know what is my investment; what do I need before I can even get started?<br>* 3 month rent deposit and first month rent<colon> 4,000  <br>* All the furnishings inside the kitchen<colon> 11,000  <br>* All accessories, cash registers, computers, etc<colon> 5,000  <br>* Cost of licences, food inspections, certifications<colon> 5,000  <br>* Cost of marketing, the Burgerbarn sign, uniforms, etc<colon> 5000  <br><br>Total startup cost<colon> 25,000<br>  <br>Sales assumptions<colon><br>  <br>* I can sell 1000 burgers a day, and I am open 25 days a month = 25,000 burgers a month.  <br>* Each burger requires 5g of lettuce = 125kilos of lettuce per month.  Lettuce costs 1 dollar per kilo = 125 dollars per month.  <br>* Each burger requires 25g of meat = 625kilos of meat. Meat costs 2 dollars per kilo = 1250 per month.  <br>* ... and so on to get a total burger costs per month of 3000 per month. Okay, that<sq>s really cheap, cool.  <br>  <br>So this is the <dq>cost of goods sold<dq>, 3000 per month for 25,000 burgers, or 12 cents a burger. <br>  <br>Then, divide your rent (1000) by the number of burgers and add it to the cost of goods sold. In fact, divide all your monthly costs to a cost-per-burger and you have your cost-price for each burger. You should also add depreciation, because all that shiny kitchen equipment you bought is slowly losing its value and you should account for that. Lets just say at the end you come to a total allocated cost of 2 dollars a burger. What margin do you want to make? 50<percent>? Sell at 4 dollars a burger if you believe you can still meet your 1000 burgers a day assumption. So your revenue is 4,000 dollars a day, or 100,000 a month. How does your cash flow come out? It is okay to be under at first, remember all that money you spent on capital expenses?  <br>  <br>  <br>This is really oversimplifying it, there is a lot of trial and error at first, so it is important to have a robust excel file, where the first tab is all the assumptions, and all the other figures and calculations are connected to that first tab. If you are not strong in excel, take the time to learn. Again, there are ton of website out there.  <br>    <br>I won<sq>t go into calculating Net Present Value and discounting your cashflows, because typing this out is going to be more confusing and there are vastly better resources online. I am just trying to give you a logical way to break down the business planning.  <br>  <br>OF course, you still have questions about food stuff, like proper storage, handling, etc etc. I hope someone else can answer those questions. Feel free to PM me if there are any other business questions I can answer. <br>  <br>**TL,DR<colon>** Forget what I wrote, there are a ton of good resources online on how to start a business, and I don<sq>t know anything about the food handling portion. <br>  <br><br><br></p>",

The Maillard reaction will help develop important umami flavours and provide an intense and meaty flavour to your stock.  Add a mirepoix, coat in the fat from the beef and roast until brown with a tomato in the mix.  The mirepoix adds width where there is depth and makes things more accessible for your palate to take in.  The browned tomato will intensify the umami from the beef and widen the flavour profile so the stock will have a wider stance on which to play with your senses.  The fragrant thyme, peppery bay leave and garlic will draw in your sense of smell so you breathe in the beefy goodness that you<sq>ll extract in the water.  Simmering for a few hours will extract most of the flavours you<sq>ll want... and then you<sq>ll be able to reduce the stock until it<sq>s simply rich with taste and aroma.<br><br>Red Wine<colon>  Not every recipe mentions the wine but many will put white or red wine after browning the onions.  It will give even more body to the stock.<br><br>Onions<colon> the best onion soup I had in my life had onions browning for 5 hours in melted butter.  Onions are high in sugar and the browning is a mix of Maillard reaction and sugar caramelization.  The sweetness will come on the tail end of the umami present in the stock and widen the taste profile even more.<br><br>Cheese<colon> a gruyere or Comte packs umami but it<sq>s also quite salty and its sharpness should wake up your sense of smell.  It should contrast with the sweetness of the onions and helps to deepen the sensation even more.  Grilling the cheese makes it pack even more umami out the gate too which if you<sq>ve not noticed is the theme of this dish.<br><br>A truly balanced onion soup will have plenty of umami and the sweetness of the onion and the saltiness in the cheese and stock should tie it all together for you.<br><br>Now one other thing about onion soup.  Don<sq>t be afraid to keep some beef fat when you clarify your stock.  This dish is supposed to be fat!  It<sq>s what French people eat around 3-6am after a night of dancing and drinking to recover from all the wine.  Fat is also where the beef keeps a lot of its flavour.  Don<sq>t be afraid to put more cheese than you think you need and let the cheese touch the liquid while grilling it.  If you have the rind of the gruyere add it while making the stock to extract even more umami flavour.<br><br>Now I<sq>m hungry...</p>",

                "answer": "<p>OK, here it goes.  I write this as someone who has lived in Korea a little over 5 years plus a background in food.  Warning, this will offend some folks who take national cuisine to seriously.  Bullet points first<colon><br><br>-It<sq>s overseasoned and lacks subtley.<br><br>-The peppers aren<sq>t that hot, which means anything remotely spicy needs tons of pepper paste.<br><br>-It lacks finesse.  It<sq>s basically chop, mix and boil.<br><br>-It lacks variety in flavor.  An over-reliance on the same basic seasonings.<br><br>-Little emphasis on quality ingredients.<br><br>-There<sq>s a nearly pathological resistance to real innovation.<br><br>-It<sq>s too entwined with nationalism<br><br><br>I<sq>m going to try to explain each point, but they<sq>ll probably all get mixed up.<br><br>Korean food is strong.  Most Korean dishes pack a serious punch of flavor.  Pepper paste, bean paste, pepper flakes and garlic are all kind of overwhelming.  The manner in which they<sq>re used in KOrean food causes a loss of subtle flavors.  It<sq>s hard to taste that seafood in the haemul tang (seafood stew) because of all the chili peppers.  Since Korean peppers don<sq>t pack lots of heat, they<sq>re dumped into food in large amounts (either fresh, as fermented paste or as dry flakes).  This means a lot of food just tastes like peppers.  It<sq>s a shame, but rarely do I see meat being honored in Korean food.  It<sq>s usually drowned in seasoning so it<sq>s hard to taste the essence of the meat.  Pepper paste is used as a crutch.  You<sq>ll see a bunch of banchan and one will be steamed broccoli; but it<sq>s meant to be dipped in vinegar-pepper paste (cho gochujang).  The same for hoe which is Korean sashimi.  It<sq>s unceremoniously dunked into cho gochujang; not a little bit for seasoning, but drenched instead.  Grilled meat and also sashimi are often wrapped in lettuce leaves with ssamjang (mixed bean and pepper paste), raw garlic etc. so the original flavors are lost and the meat/fish just plays the role of providing texture.<br><br>On the other extreme of seasoning is that some foods are barely seasoned at all.  Things like boiled bean sprouts, steamed spinach and nurungji (crusty rice mixed with plain hot water).  It<sq>s to provide a break from all the over-seasoned food.<br><br>So basically, balance it achieved by blending overly powerful stuff with weak stuff.  Rare is it that you see food with a moderate amount of seasoning which elevates the taste of the ingredients themselves.<br><br>Korean food doesn<sq>t have master levels of execution like other popular cuisines.  It<sq>s a cuisine that really relies on boiling.  Boiling is fine for some stuff, but it doesn<sq>t really shine.  Even most of the <dq>stirfries<dq> (bokkeum) are glorified boiling because of all the sauce.  Frying is sometimes done, but it<sq>s so often poorly executed that food doesn<sq>t come out crispy and is needlessly oily (and often drenched in sauce before serving to crush any hopes of crispiness).<br><br>In addition to the above, there<sq>s often little attention paid to cooking times.  Things are thrown together willy-nilly and left to boil.  It<sq>s fine for a home meal, but it doesn<sq>t pay attention to the fact that different ingredients cook differently.<br><br>The over reliance on the same basic ingredients.  Basically, Korean food is flavored by gochujang (fermented pepper paste), gochugaru (pepper flakes), doenjang (fermented bean paste), garlic, sesame oil and soy sauce.  Given that these are often used with abandon, foods often all taste the same.<br><br>There<sq>s little emphasis on quality ingredients.  Frankly, I think this is because of the reliance on heavy seasonings.  Little attention is paid to the actual ingredients.  Sure, people don<sq>t want to use week-old fish, but in most cooked dishes, the quality and freshness of ingredients takes a back seat.  (A major exception is fresh fruit, in which the best quality is highly prized).<br><br>Finally, is the lack of innovation.  There<sq>s little REAL innovation.  There<sq>s an idea that slapping kimchi on foreign food is an innovation.  Or that just subbing out one ingredient in otherwise standard dishes is innovation (I<sq>m reminded of one recent review of a pheasant restaurant in Korea which just served standard Korean fare with pheasant in place of pork/chicken).<br><br>I think the lack of innovation is tied to Korean nationalism.  There<sq>s a lot of nationalism in Korea, and food has been roped into it as a point of pride.  I think many Korean cooks are unwilling to modernize and really shake up the food because it feels like doing a disservice to the country.  Fortunately, this aspect does seem to be changing.<br><br>Lastly, I<sq>d like to argue against the idea that Korean food just hasn<sq>t had the opportunity to gain popularity because Korea just recently became prosperous.  Vietnam is a poor country that has hugely popular food.  Thailand, while not very poor, is still less prosperous than Korea and has seen its food become very popular.  Truth be told, not everyone can be popular.  It may not be an issue of time and exposure.  Korean food may just not ever be a very popular cuisine.  It may do very well as a niche cuisine because it<sq>s unique in its flavor.<br><br>TL;DR<colon> Korean food has monotonous, strong flavors and little subtlety.  It doesn<sq>t have the variety of more popular cuisines.  It can taste good, but it<sq>s not going to be a very popular cuisine any time soon. </p>",

When the sausage is browned, we add any extra fat (if necessary) and sprinkle the flour directly onto the meat. It kind of coats the sausage as we stir it, and it seems to cook more quickly that way. It<sq>s helped me get rid of the wallpaper-y flavor you<sq>ve mentioned. The gravy thickens up just fine. <br><br>- If your gravy isn<sq>t as savory as you<sq>d like, try adding some seasoning that<sq>s already in your sausage (like sage or pepper). I tend not to do this, but a few ladies I know swear by it. Plenty of salt and pepper works for me. <br><br>I hope that helps some! Good gravy is a wonderful thing. </p>",

An excess of clotted blood and the heavy presence of the minerally, iron rich chemicals that reside in the gastrointestinal systems of these animals can effectively ruin the taste of the meat, if not render it unsafe for consumption entirely. <br><br>2) How fast was it skinned? The main goal of any good processor is to get that carcass below 41 degrees Fahrenheit (around 18 degrees Centigrade if I recall correctly) as fast as possible. The hide of the animal plays a large part in trapping the heat of the animal (as one would well expect), and needs to be removed quickly to keep from exposing the meat to a temperature where certain bacterial growths and the activation of some enzymes start to break down the meat. Ever eaten beef that<sq>s too far gone? Not necessarily gamey, but it sure as hell won<sq>t help. <br><br>3) How thorough was the processor about the removal I sinew/silver skin from the different cuts of the animal? This sure ain<sq>t beef, folks, and that silver skin will let you know right quick if it<sq>s in grinds/sausage or wrapped around the outside of a deer steak. A large purpose if this tissue is to help move muscle groups past each other with relative ease compared to muscles without it, and you had better believe that it gets more use on a deer than on a cow. <br><br>In summary, know how to field dress your deer and bleed it as fast as you can. That<sq>s the extent to which most people go with their deer. <br><br>For the love of god, though, if you yourself aren<sq>t processing your deer, take it to a reputable processor. Spend the extra money. <br><br>The last thing you want is to bag a beautiful creature of the forest, pay bottom end prices at a hack shack and waste the life of that animal by treating the meat horribly and your time, effort and money as well. Do yourself a favor and get it done right, it will make all the difference. <br><br>TL<colon>DR; Improper handling/processing of the meat leaves some rank shit in your food, and as one might think, it can taste shitty in only the way a minerally, dry and chewy piece if an animal that had potential for more. </p>",

Well except some fridge space and gas on your stove that is. <br><br>*To reduce the risk for botulism when pickling, food items should be washed and cooked adequately, and utensils, containers, and other surfaces in contact with food, including cutting boards and hands, should be cleaned thoroughly with soap and warm water. Containers (e.g., jars and lids) in which pickling will occur should be sterilized (e.g., placed in boiling water for the prescribed period published in the container instructions) (3). Adequate acidification to a pH <4.6 is essential. Refrigeration at 39 F (4 C) during pickling is advisable, especially in foods that may be acidified inadequately such as whole eggs. Once opened, any canned or pickled food should be refrigerated. Pricking, poking holes, or otherwise handling whole eggs in a manner that might allow spores or bacteria into the yolk should be avoided.*. from<colon> https<colon>//www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4934a2.htm</p>",

Lay the thyme out flat and throw it in the freezer for an hour or two or at least until it<sq>s frozen.  Then we open the freezer (in our case go into the walk in freezer) and kind of crumble up the frozen thyme sprigs with our hands and shake the pan around a little bit.   Most of the little leaves fall through the perforations and sometimes only a few small stems fall through too but those can be easily picked out.  In a home kitchen I guess you could use a pasta strainer placed over a bowl. Trick is to not take it out of the freezer though while you do this or else it defrosts real quickly and the leaves stay attached.   Another trick we use sometimes which doesn<sq>t require a strainer or perforated pans is we just take a large bundle of it and wrap it in plastic wrap leaving both ends open (picture a hand rolled cigarette or joint, we call it a thyme doobie).  Throw that in the freezer again like before and when your ready to use it, just pull it out and hold it vertically between your hand and roll it loosely (like your trying to start a fire the old fashioned way) and all the frozen leaves will fall through the bottom open end.   Or if it<sq>s the less woody thyme with the green stems we usually just chop it finely, stems, leaves, and all.  But like OP said you can mostly just throw the whole sprig of thyme into most sauces and if needed strain them or remove them in the finished product or use a bouquet garnie (make a bundle of your herbs wrapped in cheese cloth and tie them off with butchers twine) and remove it from the finished product.  If you don<sq>t have cheesecloth just use butcher<sq>s twine and tie the sprigs together.   I think that<sq>s all about all the tips I can think when it comes to thyme.   It<sq>s a great herb though and there<sq>s not many things that we don<sq>t use it in in the kitchen.   Hopefully some of these tips were helpful and I didn<sq>t waste your time ;)</p>",

Just simple pork and salt and pepper gives the basic breakfast sausage, although nutmeg is not unusual in those basic grinds too. From my limited experience with US sausages the problem is they tend to use a fine grind which gives a very pulpy texture. An english sausage is much more about having a meaty texture. There is usually a good handful or two of breadcrumb in the mix (and the other issue here is I found it really difficult to find decent bread in the US, although that might just have been a result of where I was) which is  important for the texture and keeping the juicyness. Make sure the breadcrumbs come from stale bread, but splash them with a bit of water. Excess water at this stage is what causes them to split during cooking (hence <dq>bangers<dq>).</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I spent a few months developing a chicken jerky product for pets.  Here<sq>s my take.  <br><br>First off, chicken breast is very lean. Slice it any way you want, it will need to be cut thin regardless (between 7-10 mm). This lends itself to becoming very dry unless you marinate it with something to retain a bit of moisture, such as glycerin.  Even still, it will never give you the satisfying chew of beef jerky. <br><br>To commercially produce jerky, the water activity (basically the available moisture in a piece of jerky) must reach a certain level.  Once it gets to this level, it will be virtually free of any spoilage mechanism and will be considered <dq>shelf stable<dq> - does not need to be refrigerated.  The problem is the proper water activity level leaves the product very dry.  <br><br>Another point about chicken is this - if you own a chicken business, your business is selling parts at the store, or turning it into chicken nuggets.  Breasts, thigh, drum, etc.  Selling those parts make your company a ton more money than taking a premium piece of meat and turning it into jerky.  Protein like beef, pork, turkey have much more <dq>scrap<dq> parts they can use for this purpose.<br><br>The only reason we were able to get away with producing these treats for pets is because people are more willing to spend money on their furry friends.  <br><br>7 or 8 oz of dried chicken jerky costs 10.99 - 12.99.  Wouldn<sq>t you want to eat a beef jerky product that tastes better, eats better and is more than half the price?  </p>",

Specifically, high quality fish just plain looks better than the alternative. In general, the fish will be nearly translucent the higher the quality while still maintaining its natural color. The deeper the color, the nicer, as well. So if you<sq>re looking at tuna, some of the best will be a deep, dark red that light can penetrate to a degree. <br><br>For freshness, it<sq>s relatively easy to tell. Fresh fish will simply look a lot cleaner than old fish. The slices will hold better, and there won<sq>t be as much degradation of the flesh (i.e. pock marks, rips, etc.). Similarly, the texture is much different. In fresh fish, there is a certain <dq>springy-ness<dq> to the bite, whereas old fish will kind of just disintegrate. Also, smell it!<br><br>Truly though, the best way to understand this is to go to a high-quality Japanese market and inspect their sashimi-grade fish.

I think this is the translucent quality that poor_decisions is trying to describe.  The pieces should appear slightly shiny, and rich.  Note that shiny-ness can also be the result of slimy-ness.  If fish is slimy though, it will often be dull in color, and have an unpleasant smell.  When you put it in your mouth, it should almost melt deliciously on your tongue.  The taste test, of course, doesn<sq>t help you if you can only shop by appearance.  There should never, ever be any fishy odor whatsoever, except for things like mackerel.  Only a faint smell of the ocean, a very slight briny quality.  <br><br>Tuna that is bright red and jewel-like almost always tastes as good as it looks. HOWEVER, the very best tuna is toro, and there are several levels of quality, including chutoro and otoro.  Both of them are insanely scrumptious (and expensive), and both of them range from medium-pink to nearly white due to their higher fat content.  So basically, unless you have specifically ordered toro, your tuna should be the rich red color.  <br><br>If you<sq>re eating at a sushi restaurant, also observe the chef.   Is he treating the fish with respect?  Does he seem focused and happy?  Is he keeping his workspace and knife clean?  I once ate at a sushi restaurant and the chef was tossing the fish around and slamming the door to the fish case open and closed.  Another place had the fish pre-sliced and stacked up in the fish case, to speed preparation during the dinner rush.  This oxidizes the fish and speeds its aging process.  Pay attention to the little details.  </p>",

With a beef tenderloin or chicken breast, it<sq>s important to monitor temperature, to be careful against overcooking.

It<sq>s billions or trillions of them. If anything touches raw chicken, it has salmonella on it. Not as much as the chicken does, and probably not enough to cause you problems on its own, but still a lot. The real danger is contaminating other foods that will allow the salmonella to reproduce back to dangerous levels. You could probably lick a piece of raw chicken and be fine. Eating a piece would be a bad idea. Wiping a piece of lettuce on the chicken, letting the lettuce sit at room temp for twenty minutes, and eating it would be a bad idea. You<sq>d have about the same effect if a drop of liquid from your chicken splattered into some other food which you then let sit and ate. <br><br>So when it comes to cleaning and food safety, you<sq>re doing almost everything right. Salmonella is killed by high heat (165 for 30 seconds or lower temps for longer--look it up on FDA.gov), soap, or a chemical cleaner. <br><br>I<sq>d say the 60 seconds with hot soapy water is overkill. 20-30 seconds with cold or warm soapy water is fine. The hot water doesn<sq>t actually help unless it<sq>s so hot you<sq>re burning yourself. <br><br>Don<sq>t rinse chicken off. It doesn<sq>t remove the salmonella to any appreciable degree and just shoots little salmonella droplets around your kitchen. <br><br>If you can get a paper towel without touching the other ones (I leave a little corner sticking out on mine) or dripping chicken juice, you<sq>re fine. Salmonella doesn<sq>t jump through the air. Otherwise get your paper towel ready before you touch chicken. <br><br>Same deal with your sink knobs. I have a level I can turn on with my arm and an automatic soap dispenser, but back when I didn<sq>t, I<sq>d turn on the water before touching anything and use my arm to pump soap. <br><br>Definitely wash your knife thoroughly after cutting up raw chicken. Your cutting board needs to be sanitized afterwards before you can use it for anything else. There will be little bits of salmonella in the cuts on the board. I recommend ether doing your meat last or having two boards so it can go right into the dishwasher when you<sq>re done (assuming it<sq>s plastic). I actually wash mine down with soap and water before putting it in too so I don<sq>t have to worry about bumping it as much. <br><br>When you get a drop on the counter, it<sq>s definitely soap and water or cleaner time. Just a rinse, whether it be a knife, your hands, or the counter, will never be enough. <br><br>Thank you for caring enough about food safety to ask. </p>",

Not thoroughly sanitized like food service. Just clean.

Serve<br><br>Now, this is a fairly basic recipe. There are two ways to consider this an original<colon> make one change to the ingredients OR methods, big or small. But if that is the case, then EVERY single time you cook a risotto, you would be using a brand new recipe! Think about it - if you intend to follow that recipe to the letter, then every single minute difference - an extra 5 ml in your teaspoon of olive oil would be considered a change in recipe.<br><br>That<sq>s ridiculous. You<sq>d say. We need some sort of threshold to determine what constitutes an original recipe. Sure, I say. If you change 3 instructions or ingredients, we<sq>ll consider it original. So, you, being the intrepid chef, decide to invent your own risotto that is <dq>original<dq> from the recipe above. You add three new ingredients<colon> chicken pieces, mushrooms and parmesan cheese. You also add a few more instructions to your recipe.<br><br>Then this is where I say<colon> Ah, my young padawan, you have not researched well enough. Then I pull up a number of recipes that is exactly the same as yours (within the difference threshold of course, we agreed to that earlier didn<sq>t we?). <br><br>The point is, don<sq>t stress over not being original. If you<sq>ve watched any of Heston Blumenthal<sq>s TV shows you will realize he picked ideas from ancient history and science. Has nobody made hot and cold tea before? Probably. But people definitely have made tea with gellan before (I know I did before I had even heard of Heston<sq>s hot and cold tea. I smacked myself in the head for not thinking of combining hot and cold versions - I had done milk and tea instead).<br><br>Your recipe is a fine continuation of what we call forks. It is built on top of other people<sq>s recipes. Stand on the shoulders of giants and be proud of it. Don<sq>t worry too much about being original, because there isn<sq>t a lot of room for originality. That<sq>s the reason why we created Fork the Cookbook anyway - to make it easier for people to fork recipes. Because we believe all recipes are forks.</p>",

None of the recipes online are quite the same. <br><br>6 ripe yellow plantains (very soft, but firm enough to fry)<br><br>4 large eggs<br><br>2 tbsp hot water<br><br>1/4 cup diced green olives<br><br>1 cup chopped green beans<br><br>2 chicken bullion cubes (2 tsp dry bullion, 1tsp bullion concentrate)<br><br>1/2 cup fresh sofrito (onion, red bell pepper, garlic, cilantro)<br><br>2-2.5 lbs ground beef<br><br>Oil for sauteeing veg.<br><br>Salt and pepper to taste, about 1 tsp each.<br><br>6oz unflavored tomato sauce<br><br>Do a fast fry on the burger, until browned. Add sauteed sofrito (veggies should be nice and soft), tomato sauce, chicken bullion, green beans, and olives. Stir until combined well, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer. Stir occasionally. The longer it cooks, the better it tastes, but in a pinch 20min is the least you can get away with.<br><br>Peel and slice the plantains. You want them to be long, wide, and thin like a surfboard. You will be frying them in a pan, so make sure they<sq>re not so thin they can<sq>t handle a flip. The plantains can be tricky. You want them caramelized, sweet, and just slightly firm. Set them aside on a paper towel and salt them lightly. <br><br>Crack two eggs and separate the yolks (retain them). Put 1tbsp hot water in the whites and whisk vigorously with a fork, stopping before it froths up too much. Add yolks and scramble. Repeat the process with the other two eggs, but keep them separate. <br><br>Pour the egg mixture into a hot pan. Coat the pan evenly, and try to get the egg on the sides of the pan. Think a pansized, flat, thin omlette. This will be the top layer of the pinion. Lay fried plantain strips on the semi cooked egg, covering it completely.<br><br>Now pray that your pan was well greased. You will now need to flip that egg and plantain layer over onto the meat, plantain side down. Godspeed.<br><br>Fry up the second egg mixture, again covering the partially cooked egg with deliscious plantains. <br><br>Now kitchen ninjas, if you<sq>re still with me, this is a disaster waiting to happen if you<sq>re not careful.<br><br>Transfer the meat onto the eggs and plantains. You should now have a sunny yellow egg layer on top, and one on bottom. If your pan was well greased, and your prayers answered, then sliding the pinion out of the pan and onto a serving dish will be a piece of cake. I bet I have a pic somewhere.

Get the griddle as hot as possible.  Oven works, but so does a long-enough sit on the gas burner.  <br><br>2. Sear the steaks.  I like to do one minute a side, twice. So two minutes a side total.  I find this gets the best crust with the least chance of overcooking.  Added bonus on the griddle is you can flip the steak 90 degrees on the second round for a nice crosshatch.  Only do as many steaks as you can comfortably fit on the pan.  Crowding the pan will detriment your sear, even with cast iron.    <br><br>3. Preheat your oven to a medium temp (160-170 C/320-340 F)<br><br>4. After each steak sears, transfer to a rack over a baking tray.  I find this gets a more even cook than with the steak resting directly on a pan.  Don<sq>t worry about getting the steaks in the oven right away, you can wait for them all to be seared with very minimal effect. If people like their steaks done differently, you can put some in earlier than the others.  <br><br>5.  Get your steaks in the oven for ~10 minutes <br><br>6.  Take your steaks out, cover with foil and rest for 5 mins (they<sq>re already on racks!) <br><br>7. WARM PLATES.  The only slight niggle about this method is that the steaks will not be **hot** when you get to them, so a warm plate is important to keep them at an enjoyable temperature throughout the meal.  <br><br>Now all ovens and ranges differ, not to mention cuts of steak, so I would try this out with one steak for yourself to begin with so you can adjust as necessary when it<sq>s dinner party time. Plus you have an excuse to eat an extra steak.  I know it<sq>s not as quick as the mothod you<sq>ve got, but it<sq>s always worked well for me. </p>",

Fill the pot back up every now and them to keep the bones covered.<br><br> * Remember to pull off the soggy, rubbery skin and *save it!!* in a tuperware or something.<br><br> * Reduce the poaching liquid down until it starts looking darker then cool it down and get it into the fridge.<br><br> * Once the poaching liquid is fully cooled, take the turkey fat puck off of the top, throw it in a ziplock, wrap it in foil and use in anything you want to be delicious.<br><br> * Portion out the turkey jello that was the reduced poaching liquid and use in anything you want to be delicious (I recommend ramen, especially with the above mentioned fat).<br><br> * Fry the gross looking turkey skin up like bacon or flatten it out and throw it under the broiler until it crisps up. I seriously cook chicken like this just for the skin sometimes, it<sq>s so much better when you don<sq>t have to worry about crisping it up on the bird.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>A few tips<colon> try to learn what common tastes actually taste like. Usually things are mixed together with a lot of other flavours so it can be hard to pick out what the individual flavours are. Taste everything that goes into your food. Strong things like spices are easier if you just taste your fingers after handling them. <br><br>Slow down when you taste things. Start by smelling the food. And I mean really smelling it. Like a bloodhound sniffing the ground. Short little breaths in and out through your mouth and nose at the same time. Then when you put the food into your mouth chew it up and get it all over your whole mouth cavity. Close your eyes and concentrate on the sensations. The textures and the tastes. Try to pick out individual tastes. You might taste one thing when it first hits your mouth and then other flavours might start to pop out at you. Coffee and red wine are great examples of this. The second and third sip sometimes taste completely different from the first. <br><br>Some foods need salt or acid to make them pop. Adding a tiny touch of salt to a tomato makes it taste more tomato-y. Same for adding acid to things. If you have a dish that tastes muddled try adding vinegar or lemon juice to it. See if the flavours start to pop a little more. We have a taco recipe that tastes like muddled fishy stuff until you squeeze a lime on it right before eating. Then all of a sudden all the individual flavours start to jump out at you. <br><br>And last tip is don<sq>t blow out your palate with strong flavours before you eat the main course. Appetizers loaded with things like garlic or chilis will hide all the nuances in your food. You can<sq>t <dq>cleanse<dq> your palate of those flavours. Same thing for drinks like bourbon or scotch. Save them for after the meal. </p>",

If I was spending that much money on a meal, I really wanted to remember it (and not puke afterwards like I did when I ate at the French Laundry). It<sq>s pretty common for people to want non-alcoholic pairings- they did different juices and mixes and stuff and it was fantastic. They even did one with the meat course that tasted like red wine- but wasn<sq>t. It shouldn<sq>t affect your experience at all, the beverage staff is trained for that situation. <br><br>2) There are a lot of courses and TONS of fancy breads (that<sq>s what I made when I worked there), so you will leave feeling full. I could barely walk out of there afterwards! All those bites add up, and they<sq>re small so your palate doesn<sq>t get fatigued. <br><br>I really enjoy going out to fancy restaurants. We save up and go for one or two big meals a year. Since my husband is a chef too, we look at it as career enrichment- you have to go see and taste what the competition is doing, right? It<sq>s the same reason we buy fancy cookbooks. We look at it as an experience. If you<sq>re going expecting to get value for your money, you can definitely go to some fancy cheaper restaurants, for sure. Money is no concept for lots of the clients there. But I know for when I worked there if the service staff noticed that people seemed to be really into the food or had obviously saved up for a long time to eat there, we always sent them extra courses.</p>",

They are a Japanese take on the classic French chef knives made throughout Europe.  <br>-Gyotos often have Western handles but wa-gyotos are also widely available with Japanese handles.  <br>-Gyotos have a thinner blade and are made with harder steel.  <br>-Between 21cm and 27cm. <br><br>[**Santoku**](http<colon>//imgur.com/e7D3x)  <br>-Second most commonly owned knife.  <br>-Mostly flat blade, curved at the tip, occasionally comes with bevels.  <br>-Bevels, dimples or <dq>hollow ground<dq> knives reduce friction/suction issues with vegetables, especially wetter ones.     <br>-Most widely used knife.

Often a knife set filler.  <br>-Basically the bastard child of a chef knife and a pairing knife.  <br>-Personally I like it for butchering small fish and fowl and as a knife to keep within reach on the line.<br>-A Japanese petty knife is basically a smaller Honesuki and as such is wonderful at deboning.  <br>-Easier to make contact with the cutting board than a pairing knife if your cutting tips off small items.  <br>-Beween 10cm and15cm.<br><br>**Boning Knife**  <br>-Guess what it<sq>s for? In case you didn<sq>t know, you (almost) never cut *through* a bone.  <br>-Two main types Western of boning knives<colon> [**stiff**](http<colon>//imgur.com/3qXge) and [**flexible**](http<colon>//imgur.com/xL0az).  <br>-Blade curves up at the end and into a point so you can really get into a joint without destroying the meat.    <br>-Flexible is VERY thin and is used mostly for fish and poultry.    <br>-Stiff is wider and thicker, usually used for pork, beef and game.  <br>-Predominantly used inside an animal, not for board work.  <br>-Between 12cm and 15cm  <br><br>[**Fillet Knife**](http<colon>//imgur.com/AxA3Z)   <br>-A 15cm-30cm extra thin version of the flexible boning knife.  <br>-The flexibility of the knife aids it in moving around the spine and staying flush to the ribs of the fish, maximizing yield.<br><br>[**Honesuki**](http<colon>//imgur.com/GWjfu)  <br>-Japanese boning knife.    <br>-Stiff triangular blade for severing tendons and exposing joints.  <br>-Comes to a point at the end so it fits in small spaces.  <br>-Usually used for larger animals with uncuttable bones.  <br>-Between 13cm and 17cm.<br><br>[**Deba**](http<colon>//imgur.com/7Le8Z)  <br>-Japanese boning knife very often used in western kitchens.  There are a wide variety of Debas.     <br>-Extremely thick blade. A good deba will be 5mm thick at the hilt.  <br>-Very heavy knife used for poultry and fish butchery. Instead of avoiding (small) bones this knife is meant to cut through them with ease.  <br>-Single bevel - This knife is only sharpened on one side so you can lay the other side down (on a spine for example) and slide across without digging downwards.  <br>-Between 15cm and 24cm. <br><br>**[Carving Knife](http<colon>//imgur.com/gINcC) / [Sujihiki](http<colon>//imgur.com/SLCCT) / [Yanagi](http<colon>//imgur.com/p3Ghi)**  <br>-All three of the these knives are slightly different but are very similar.    <br>-Very long, very thin, stiff blade. Western versions are occasionally bevelled.   <br>-Used for long slices of a single item.  <br>-Yanagi is slightly different as it is single bevelled and predominantly used on raw fish. Often has a more square front as well.  <br>-Between 20cm and 40cm.<br><br>[**Nakiri**](http<colon>//imgur.com/qIYtu)  <br>-Japanese chopping knife, meant for vegetables.  <br>-Flat bottom, square front, very little curve anywhere.  <br>-Meant for up and down motion.  <br>-Often used in Japanese homes instead of a santoku for vegetable prep.  <br>-Between 15cm and 21cm.  <br><br>[**Hard Cheese Knife**](http<colon>//imgur.com/6VVkt,a8MFr)  <br>-Small, very sturdy and sharp. Pointed tip for piercing hard cheese casings.  <br>-Often a more <dq>pretty<dq> knife due to it often being served with the cheese.   <br>-Not to be confused with a Parmesan knife, or Italian hard cheese knife, this knife is for SLICING cheese, not breaking it.  <br>-[**Parmesan Knives**](http<colon>//imgur.com/Q3iMT) are used to stab an entire wheel of hard cheese and BREAK off pieces. Pieces are broken instead of sliced to maximize surface area and in turn oxidization.   <br>-Between 6cm and 12cm. Even smaller for Parm knife.   <br><br>[**Soft Cheese Knife**](http<colon>//imgur.com/6VVkt,a8MFr#1)  <br>-One of the few knives that really can not be used for more than one purpose.  <br>-Occasionally, but not necessarily, serrated.  <br>-Unique in the large holes in the sides of the knife.  <br>-These holes are like super bevels, eliminating friction. Without these holes a soft cheese will stick to the knife, fold over on itself and basically look like a creamy mess.  <br>-Between 10cm and 15cm.<br><br>[**Kiritsuke**](http<colon>//imgur.com/mCiq5)  <br>-Large, multipurpose knife meant for advanced users.  <br>-Single bevel and <dq>sword tipped<dq> the point of this knife is very delicate and has a habit of sticking in boards.  <br>-The length and bevel of the blade makes this knife a decent slicer, the flatness makes it an excellent chopper and the point makes it a decent deboning knife.   <br>-An advanced Japanese cook could use this as his line knife.  <br>-Between 24cm and 33cm.    <br><br>[**Turning Knife**](http<colon>//imgur.com/JGuuM)     <br>-<dq>Turning<dq> comes from the French <dq>tourner<dq> and turning is still predominantly seen in classic French restaurants.  <br>-Also known as <dq>bird beak<dq> knife the defining feature is the concave curve in the blade that makes cutting/cleaning round items easier with less waste.  <br>[-These](http<colon>//imgur.com/d30ZW) are <dq>turned vegetables<dq> or <dq>vegetables tourne<dq>  <br>-Very common in Western knife sets, I<sq>ve never seen a Japanese version but anything<sq>s possible.  <br>-Most often used to peel rounded vegetables and fruit since turning has seen a drop in popularity.  <br>-Always used in the air, using this knife on a board would be pointless.  <br>-Between 5cm and 7cm    <br><br>[**Cleaver**](http<colon>//imgur.com/ji0U4) (Western)  <br>-Large, thick, rectangular and front heavy the Western cleaver is mostly used in butchery.  <br>-The cleaver is designed to be swung like a hammer, with force enough to chop bones, not for slicing.  <br>-In order to survive the punishment inflicted upon the blade cleavers are made with very thick and soft metal. The softer metal absorbs some of the blow and won<sq>t fracture like a harder steel.  <br>-The top of many Western cleavers is concave and often has a steeper angle towards the tip of the blade. This is done so that if you need to apply more pressure, you can use your other hand on top of the blade with less risk of your hand sliding off the front and slicing your palm open.  <br>-Between 15cm and 30cm.  <br><br>[**Chinese Cleaver**](http<colon>//imgur.com/XzVci)   <br>-Actually a misnomer, the Chinese <dq>cleaver<dq> is more of a Chinese chef knife.     <br>-Chukabocho is the Japanese version of a Chinese chef knife like a Gyoto is a Western chef knife.   <br>-Not indented like the Western version, this blade is almost completely rectangular, like a giant Nakiri.    <br>-The thin blade makes it a nice all round knife if your used to it but it is NOT meant to be used on bones.  <br>-Between 18cm and 28cm.<br><br><br>There are of course MANY other types of knives, but these are the ones that I come across most often.

Too much butter and the same thing would happen if you greased for an Angel food cake. It would not rise. The too things have two very different end results. One is a drier, well structured cake while the other is an unstabilized, risened  pudding so to speak. <br><br>Souffl\u00e9 batter usually has extra fat from egg yolks and added butter, no flour, and a meringue is folded in to not disturb the air pockets created in it. The sugar is a liquefier and attracts moister which will help steam the souffl\u00e9 and make it rise high but, it<sq>ll be rather unstable. That<sq>s why souffl\u00e9s need to be served immediately or else all the lovely leavening that was created will escape and deflate. <br><br>Angel food cakes have no fat, relay on the flour, sugar, and egg whites for stabilization, they also only use only egg whites for leavening. As the cake bakes it rises and much like Meringue cookies, a darker and drier crust is formed around it ( more so on the bottom where they touch the pan.) The egg whites in the cake do the same thing. If it was greased the fat not only disturbs the air bubbles in the meringue but also create a slick surface and added moisture. Too much moisture results in deflating. <br><br>Preparing the pan for angel food cake like a souffl\u00e9 pan I believe would have either 2 results. It<sq>ll rise but, no where near as high as it usually would, wouldn<sq>t have that brown crust, and deflate or it just would not rise at all because of the butter. <br><br>Sorry for such a wordy reply! </p>",

The muscles in this area generally are used less by the animal, and as such result in more tender meat that doesn<sq>t have too beefy of a flavor. These cuts include (in order from head to butt) chuck eye, ribeye, strip, t-bones and finally sirloin, with a special note of the tenderloin/filet mignon which is a whole different set of muscles which runs underneath the aforementioned muscles and gets used even less. Just about every other piece of meat on the cow sees work, and as such requires time to cook and break down the tough bonds between the muscles that have been built up over the lifetime of the cow. Work = Toughness = more room for error in seasoning. <br><br> Everything else called steak may very well deserve the title as a steak in layman<sq>s terms, but technically doesn<sq>t have too much in the way of similarity.

You actually want to form a very thin layer of hard fudge on the table when making the first batch. This helps subsequent batches harden up a bit more uniformly and reduces a bit of the stickiness. The slabs I have used in the past are about 10<dq> thick which is really helpful as they can absorb an enormous amount of heat. So when hot fudge is poured out the side touching the stone forms a sort of skin, also reducing the stickiness.<br><br>With hard candies I<sq>ve used solid metal tables with water cooling systems. This provides accurate temperature control and a smooth surface. I<sq>ve always oiled and floured these, and I believe this was also the old-timey approach. There isn<sq>t so much of an issue with contamination as the proportion of oil and flour to candy is insignificantly low.<br><br>Essentially the rule is the closer the temperatures of the surface and the mixture are at the time of pouring, the more likely you are to have a sticky mess. Cold table, hot sugar.<br><br>As for something in your home, you can pick up proper marble slabs if you are lucky but you should be able to get hold of granite or stabilised stone pretty cheap.

But when I was buying hamburger often, I<sq>d usually pick the quality on what I was going to do with it.  If I<sq>m making burger patties, I<sq>d go with 80/20, I find the extra fat helps make those patties hold shape more than if I used something leaner.  <br><br>If I<sq>m making tacos (which, btw, try [Alton Brown<sq>s Taco Potion #19](http<colon>//www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/taco-potion-19-recipe/index.html) if you haven<sq>t already.....you<sq>ll never go back to your old taco seasoning), I find that leaner gives me better results, even post-drain.  I<sq>ve tried 96/4, 90/10, and 80/20 for taco meat, and higher fat seems to make it harder to get the taco meat broken up, and despite draining, it just doesn<sq>t seem to give the results I<sq>m looking for.  In the end the 80/20 seems to have more chew to it, like an overcooked chew.  If I<sq>m using 90/10 or leaner, I can brown, add the seasoning and splash of beef broth, then go right into reduction without any pausing to drain.  The flavor and consistency of the meat just seemed to come out better.<br><br>That was just what I found though.  Yeah, the price is a bit crazy, I can<sq>t bring myself to drop $12 for 2lbs of ground beef.  The work around for this (assuming you want leaner and you<sq>re not doing your shopping in the dead of the night) is to ask the butcher counter what the ground beef in their case is.  At all the stores I go to, the case is 90/10, and the price is $3.99 - $4.99/lb, vs the shelf prepackaged 90/10 usually being $5.49+/lb.<br><br>Of course, the entire point is moot if you switch to grinding your own beef.

What is that white substance that I see on the tips or surface of the beans - is that mold?<br><br>A. Unfortunately, it might be mold, but do not throw your beans away - they are still good! <br><br>While vanilla beans historically have rarely been susceptible to mold issues, we regret to report we have recently been experiencing some instances of mold appearing on our Madagascar and Uganda gourmet vanilla beans. From the best information we can gather from long-time colleagues in the vanilla business, this is most likely due to over-pollination of the vanilla vines in the field, thus weakening the root stock, and making the beans more susceptible to infestation. The growers and collectors have also apparently been picking the beans too soon and not curing/drying them properly, which can also promote mold growth. <br><br>Needless to say, we do our best to put all the vanilla beans we receive through a Quality Assurance inspection, and will not ship any beans before visually examining them. It does happen, however, in spite of our best efforts, that the mold doesn\u2019t appear until the beans get into the hands of a customer, sometimes within just a few days, and sometimes as much as a few weeks or months later -- and even if they are stored in ideal conditions. <br><br>Here is the best information we have gathered from reliable sources regarding the white vanilla mold we have been seeing recently<colon><br>The mold just grows on the outside of the beans and doesn<sq>t really affect the beans themselves.<br>The mold comes from the source country - it does NOT develop just from the surrounding air, as bread or cheese mold does.<br>Also, unlike bread or cheese mold, it does NOT make the vanilla beans stale or unusable.<br>To the best of our knowledge, this mold is not harmful (we have not even heard of any allergic reactions to vanilla mold) and it does not affect the flavor of the beans.<br>To remove, just wipe off the mold with a terry cloth (like a kitchen or \u201cgym\u201d towel) -- preferably moistened in vodka (which is essentially <dq>drinking alcohol<dq>) -- alcohol will help clean the beans and kill the mold.<br>You can also spread them out on a drying rack (like an oven rack) in a sunny window (or, better yet, outside in direct sunlight) for a day or so after wiping off the excess mold.<br>Sunlight and heat will kill the mold and also absorb any excess moisture in the beans that the mold seems to proliferate in.<br>If you are using the beans to make home made extract, this is perfect, since you are putting the beans in the vodka itself that will get rid of the mold at the same time.<br>Since heat also kills mold (like the sunlight treatment we recommend), using the beans in a recipe for cooking or baking, after wiping off the excess, will also do the trick.<br>Click here for our other recommendations for storing your vanilla beans.<br>One last comment<colon> the white substance that appears on beans is not always mold. Sometimes, due to temperature and humidity conditions, or how the beans are stored, the vanillin in the beans (vanillin being the principal flavor component in vanilla beans that gives them their characteristic vanilla flavor) will actually crystalize out to the surface of the beans. You can see this in the picture of vanilla beans we have at the top of our website - see the white spots and lines on the beans on the far right side of the picture? This is a good thing -- it shows the high quality of the vanilla beans that they have such a high vanillin content! So if the white substance appears more <dq>crystalline,<dq> than <dq>fuzzy,\u201d or <dq>spongy,<dq> it is probably just vanillin, and the beans are just fine. If you warm the beans up a bit, the vanillin will usually melt back into the beans. But you can use them just as they are, as well. <br><br>If your beans do go moldy within a short time after your purchase, please contact us to let us know, and, if you wish, we will process an exchange or refund. [We cannot guarantee the freshness of your beans past a reasonable amount of time, however, so no claims will be accepted more than 30 days after purchase, or if your beans show any evidence of prior use, alteration or adulteration.]</p>",

                "answer": "<p>In addition to what<sq>s already been said, some plants will deplete soil for different reasons too. In the case of grape vines, they establish roots the grow deeply over time and can access new nutrients or water sources. A wine maker one told me an anecdote during a tour that they lost an entire field of really great old vines because the roots finally grew deep enough to access a new source of water that ruined the quality of the vines. The same is true for old trees and such.<br><br>The big reason you need to rotate crops is that they almost always last a single season, thus only take nutrients from the top soil because their roots are too shallow. Crops like grapes last so long that they can establish big root systems that take from other places than the top soil.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I opened a restaurant 8 months ago at the age of 30 with my good friend and business partner.  I<sq>d worked as a server and captain in my cities best restaurants and had great service and wine skills.  My partner brings more back office and operations backgrounds.  We met 4 years ago on the opening team of a new restaurant.<br><br>We weren<sq>t ready, but I don<sq>t think we<sq>d have been any more ready in another 5 years.  Simply put, there is no way to learn how to manage a buildout, vet contractors, source equipment, or deal with the incredible and inevitable construction issues until you do it yourself.  We approached each day as a puzzle, researching problems and attacking them until that one was handled the next one came up.<br><br>The buildout was one of the most stressful periods of my life, the last month excruciating as we pushed to get doors open before money ran out and we failed before we got to the beginning.  I don<sq>t think people appreciate how much work it takes just to get to the starting line and earn the opportunity to fail.<br><br>And then when doors opened, life miraculously made sense again.  We were back doing what we loved and were good at.  We knew how to run a restaurant, how to hire, how to train, how to make guest happy, and we learned how to make the bottom line work.<br><br>These last 8 months have been everything I<sq>ve ever wanted.  We<sq>ve been fortunate to be well reviewed, embraced by our community, and consistently busy.  We are meeting our sales goals and even repaying or investors faster than planned. <br><br>I think at some point, you have to take the plunge and hope you come out on the other side.  No operator will ever let you see everything they do, and some things you can<sq>t learn until you<sq>re faced with them.<br><br>It was crucial for us to have a great network of support to draw on.  I<sq>m not sure how we would have made it without the advice and mentoring from our previous bosses and other operators and the introductions to the right people to make the project work.  From liquor lawyers, to contractors, to city hall, and suppliers, there is a network of people you need to succeed.  I think access to that network and advice on navigating it were the best things we were given.  I<sq>m not sure we could have been successful without it.  <br><br>Also, get a great accountant that you trust.  Overpay if you have to.  And listen to them!  You cannot do it without them.  </p>",

The plus side of this is once you get it down, it is one of the easiest ways to cook huge amounts of very good food, as once you have the base ingredients down and available it frequently requires just one or two pots and less close observation than some other cuisines.<br><br>In no particular order<colon><br><br>Cook lentils completely separately, rinse well until the water runs clear and cool before using in anything or they can discolour a dish and make it look like grey brown sludge.<br><br>Colour is very important to many types of Indian food. Don<sq>t be afraid to use Tandoori Masala powders and other very richly coloured spices even if they don<sq>t seem to have much flavour - we frequently eat with our eyes.<br><br>Don<sq>t overuse tumeric, and generally add it into the early frying stages to temper it as it can easily dominate a dish.<br><br>Always add Garam Masala at the end of the cooking process.<br><br>Chili powder changes in colour and flavour depending on when you add it to food. Many Indian chefs add it at the start, middle and end to create a very rich flavour as each stage develops its own subtleness.<br><br>Coconut and lime should generally be used fresh, although desiccated coconut often adds much more to certain dishes (Ceylons in particular are significantly better with processed coconut on the whole imo).<br><br>Onion, garlic and ginger should be beaten or blended to a very fine paste - the thickness and richness of many good currys comes mostly from this base trio being blended finely and then cooked to melting point. Big bits dont work as well for this.<br><br>Bases, meat, vegetables and lentils can, and often should, all be made separately and mixed later. If you watch an Indian Chef team at work they are often effectively blending lots of pre made ingredients together for many dishes, sort of like a reverse stew. Meat may be slow cooked or tandoored then added to a base medium-hot sauce, both of which are then tempered with a little cream, spinach and fenugreek leaves in the pan. You end with what looks like a one pot stew but it actually was all made in seperate stages and only brought together right at the end.<br><br>Fish and shell fish is very good and under ordered/valued in Indian food by most westerners.<br><br>Tandooring is very hard to replicate. If you have to a grill on full just about does the job but check it closely or you can either burn it to oblivion or have it raw.<br><br>Reheated base ingredients (particularly base sauces) often taste better. Many Indian chefs barely use bases when they first make them, as the reheating process further denatures the ingredients and adds to the sauce<sq>s texture when reheated.<br><br>If you can, it is well worth asking in your best local eatery if you can do a few days unpaid kitchen portering to see what they do. I<sq>ve done this a few times and you very quickly pick up lots of the steps in the process you have been missing at home. Indian food is generally very regional, so you also quickly see how different the process can be for certain styles of dish depending on who you are working with - which you can then take and incorporate into making exactly what you love in the way of flavour, texture and ingredients.</p>",

Simple sushi tastes the best, but it<sq>s also the most intimidating, because you can<sq>t hide behind anything.<br><br>- The fish per maki really depends on how you make your rolls - it<sq>s a fish to rice ratio. Sushi<sq>s very much a <dq>feel<dq> thing.<br><br>- I think you mean sushi vinegar? There<sq>s no oil. Spread the sushi rice out post-cook in a the largest wooden bowl you have, sprinkle over the rice vinegar with sugar and salt dissolved in it, gently fold into the rice, and fan the sushi to get the look and texture right.<br><br>- Just water<br><br>- Pickled ginger.

                "answer": "<p>To answer the question properly<colon> It<sq>s up to you, really.<br><br>Milk, or just any liquid in general is added to egg for multiple reasons. The biggest reason being steam. As the eggs are heated, steam is generated. This steam is what we need to utilize to make eggs fluffy and light(if that<sq>s what you<sq>re going for). By increasing the amount of liquid in the egg, we can generate more steam and therefore make a lighter product.<br><br>Milk, or better yet half and half or even butter, also contains fat. The fat can prevent the proteins from binding to tightly to each other. This in turn will give you a lighter, less dense egg. The small amount of lactose in dairy products can also help your omelet brown.(if that<sq>s what you<sq>re going for)<br><br>The counter arguments for adding liquid is that it dilutes flavor and that ironically liquid can make it more dense. In my opinion, the vast differences of these explanations comes from different egg cooking techniques and preferences.<br><br>Think about this. If you cook your eggs slowly, like on low heat, or you stir constantly, the whole notion of the <dq>steaming<dq> effect isn<sq>t really at play. The heat simply isn<sq>t high enough for a good amount of steam to be produced. In addition, the constant stirring(like in Ramsay<sq>s method) is not trying to produce light fluffy curds, but more of a creamy consistency.<br><br>But if you are one of those who makes eggs on higher heat, and your ideal eggs are light and fluffy with large curds, the steaming effect is something to consider.<br><br>The notion of adding fat is far less contested, as virtually all forms of egg will benefit from fat.<br><br>While we are on this topic, we should explore salts effect on egg as well. This, like the liquid argument is anything but accepted. Some say salt makes the eggs dense and watery, while others say almost the complete opposite. I honestly don<sq>t know who is right here, but I believe it again has to do with preference.<br><br>The idea of adding salt well before cooking the eggs is that the salts electrical charge will change the protein structure of the egg and keep it from binding to tightly together. We know this is true for meats and such, so this definitely is viable.<br><br>The anti-salt camp claim that the salt <dq>cooks<dq> the egg too much and too easily and you end up with easily overcooked, dense and rubbery eggs.<br><br>It all comes down to your preference and technique in my opinion. You should experiment and decide for yourself which you prefer. The way I treat eggs vary depending on what I am looking for.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Microwaves ovens heat food by blasting the food with microwaves. The microwaves impart energy to any (not just water) asymmetrical molecules. The energy transfer causes those molecules to heat up by making them vibrate. Because of the way microwaves are generated, you end with localized regions in the microwave of higher energy and lower energy which will lead to hot and cold spots in your food. Moving these spots around is doable, but it<sq>s much cheaper to try and move the food through these spots, hence the turntable or some models have a rotating disc in the wall that bounces the microwaves around more. Similar to how leaving food in a pan to cook without stirring will lead to burning, not moving the food around these high energy regions will lead to uneven heating. This is why you should **NEVER IGNORE** microwaving directions to let your food sit after microwaving. Letting it sit allows any hot spots in the food to conduct their excess heat into the colder regions, like letting a piece of meat rest and seeing the temperature go up a few degrees from carryover cooking. However, the gradients in microwave cooking can be much more severe, and there have been a few cases of food poisoning from people not letting their tv dinners sit long enough after microwaving. Ever bit into a cold spot in a microwave good, how sure are you that cold spot didn<sq>t contain raw meat?</p>",

With slicing and dicing try to set yourself up like a factory line - if you<sq>re cutting up three onions, first take the skin off all three, then cut all three in half, then chop the halves. Saves you time putting the knife down / onions away / switching boards etc. Have a trashbin right next to your bench, or at least a container to throw stuff in so you don<sq>t have to walk back and forth. Simple things like that. <br><br>If you need to bring water to the boil you might as well just pump the BTUs into it. Highest setting until it reaches boiling point. You can do the same thing for a simmer too, just go by a thermometer reading the water temperature and you won<sq>t really have to babysit it (or bringing milk / cream to the boil for that matter). For pan heating I would recommend not to; we<sq>re talking flammables here. Go with the setting needed for your application (lowish for sweating, high for searing) from the start. <br><br>When I<sq>m doing something really messy, like fileting a fish, I just plastic wrap my entire bench. After the fileting is done, remove the wrap ... instant cleaning. For faster cleaning of all the bits and pieces that are typically laying around after cutting veggies, get yourself a bench scraper and the aforementioned trash container. <br><br>For searing in oil / deep frying, get yourself a splatter guard for the pan. You can of course use a regular pan lid as long as steam can escape. I prefer the splatter guard. You<sq>ll be amazed at how much oil gets absolutely everywhere around your range over time if you don<sq>t use this. <br><br>Anything you should clean that most people don<sq>t, at least at home? Probably your hands. <br><br>A food processor is most definitely worth it, although it won<sq>t really cut your veggies right for a stir fry. An immersion blender is a huge time saver for any soups or sauces and I would consider it a necessity above even a food processor. <br><br>Other than that, practice.

                "answer": "<p>Honey and sugar(sucrose, aka white granulated sugar), while both being sweet and primarily sugar, have quite different effects in baked goods.<br><br>White sugar is composed of 100<percent> sucrose and, perhaps more importantly is in solid, crystalline form. Because of this form, it is commonly used to to create air pockets in sugar in the infamous <dq>creaming<dq> method. I am sure you and your friend has made cakes/cookies with the creaming method. It involves beating sugar and butter together, adding the egg, then alternatively dry and wet ingredients. The act of beating sugar into butter penetrates the butter with thousands of air pockets. These air pockets expand in the oven with the help of a chemical leavener like baking soda or powder. It is this expansion of air pockets that gives cakes their light, even and fluffy texture.<br><br>With honey, it is composed of a combination of mainly fructose(the sugar in fruit) and glucose(the sugar in animals). There are small amounts of other disaccharides and oligosaccharides too. More importantly, honey is a liquid(12-20<percent> water). Liquids, can<sq>t really hold air that well, nor can they beat air pockets into butter. This means the creaming method is not really effective with honey. This isn<sq>t the end of the world, as you can make plenty of baked goods without this method, but it is something to keep in mind.<br><br>It is important to keep in mind that unlike table sugar, all honey is not created equal. They can vary not only in flavor, but in water content and even sugar composition. Approximate values would look something like 40<percent> fructose, 35<percent> glucose, 15<percent> water and 15<percent> other sugars/carbohydrates/micronutritiets. Ironically, this makeup of honey makes it about as sweet as table sugar in liquid form, meaning equal sweetness is achieved weight for weight.<br><br>Because of this makeup oh honey, it has a hygroscopic property. This means it loves water and retain it incredibly well. This further translates to anything made with honey staying moist longer.<br><br>When substituting sugar with honey, as I mentioned above, the sweetness levels are about equal(weight for weight). So you basically just sub cup for cup. However, keep in mind honey has a water content, which could throw off some dry/wet ratios slightly. It is likely a good idea to use slightly less(10<percent>) wet ingredients when substituting large amounts of honey for sugar. Other than that, and the whole you can<sq>t really cream honey, it is an easy substitution.<br><br>EDIT<colon> Almost forgot about browning. Honey, because of its less complex reducing sugars(mainly fructose), baked goods with honey brown faster. It is a good idea to slightly lower the oven temperature(10F~), and also make sure your baking equipment is shiny and not dull.</p>",

This of course may make a difference if you<sq>re using starchy flours.

Depending on the dish and the container, placing a hot dish in a cool refrigerator can cause condensation and standing water in the container, which can accelerate spoilage. Very hot dishes in cold refrigerators can sometimes (but rarely) lead to breakage of either the dish or glass shelves. And a large amount of very hot food (like a giant pot of just-off-the-boil stock) in a refrigerator could potentially bring up the overall temp of the fridge, or in a crowded fridge with poor circulation could cause a localized hotspot that could potentially lead to spoilage. But almost all of these are edge cases. I usually leave hot things to cool a bit on the counter first, but in the vast majority of cases you should be fine just bunging them in the fridge.</p>",

You<sq>re looking at making Asian fried chicken nuggets and a bit of a tossing sauce at the end, let me make you a recipe based on the picture.  It<sq>s approximate but should work<colon><br><br>- To massage together in a bowl<colon><br>- 2 large skin-off chicken thighs cubed into 3cm cubes<br>- 1 shot of shao tsing wine or white wine, dry sherry, just some dry cooking wine<br>- 1 tsp of garlic powder<br>- 1 tsp of salt<br>- 1 tsp of sugar<br>- 1/2 tsp of white pepper<br>- 1 egg<br>- 1/2 tsp of baking soda<br>- 1/4 teaspoon or less of MSG (if you like flavour)<br><br>Fridge for 30 mins or so.  Then add<colon><br><br>- 1/2 cup of corn or potato starch<br><br>Massage it all up again til the white starch is gone, it should become a liquid batter tinted yellow from the yolk at this point.

Fry about 5 minutes til gold and then bring them out and drain.<br><br>Chili sauce<colon><br><br>- 1-2 Thai red chilis sliced<br>- 1-2 eshallots cut into 4cm lengths <br>- 2 cloves of garlic minced<br>- 1/4 white onion sliced<br>- chinese dried chili flakes or Italian dried chili flakes<br>- shao tsing wine<br><br>Bring a couple dashes of oil up to heat in a wok.  Put the onion in and stir fry about 30 secs-1min, then add the garlic and keep it moving.  Add the eshallots and keep it moving til they wilt up, will take 2 mins at most for all this.  Add the chills and chili flakes, add some S+P, deglaze it out with a splash of the shao tsing wine and let it evaporate as you keep moving it in the wok with a spatula.  Now add the fried chicken bits and stir it all up just to coat and then dump it on your plate to serve.</p>",

This is especially true if you are only cooking for 2 people. <br><br>Also mise en place is specific to the area where you are cooking. If it is your home kitchen and you have the intention of not being wasteful with your dish usage, your mise should be more simple and efficient. You do not need (in my opinion) any ramekins or separate bowls for ingredients. If you are chopping mirepoix, it can all go in one container. If you are making stir fry and each veg has it<sq>s own special cooking time, it can all chill out on your cutting board in little piles. If you are making more complex dishes that require multiple sauces, stocks, raw meat prep, pastry ect. you should just try your best to clean as you go.

Because they aren<sq>t very sharp, you<sq>ll find that you need to apply a little more force to cut through the meat. Combine that with doing it at high speeds and you need a stable grip. The pointer grip is less stable in keeping the knife edge facing directly down. It rolls easier from left to right. Try this at home<colon> with the pointer grip, press a chefs knife down onto a cutting board with a good amount of force. Make sure your off hand isn<sq>t nearby. At a certain amount of force the knife edge will buckle in or out and slide to either side. Imagine if you<sq>re cutting a piece of steak and it buckles causing the blade to suddenly be headed toward your off hand. Now try the same thing with a pinch grip. Notice that you can put an immense amount more downward pressure before it buckles. Safety first.<br><br>Next, like others have said the blade angle in relation to your wrist makes the pointer grip harder to use down on a board. With enough repetition you<sq>re asking for wrist and forearm injury. I<sq>m working on a wrist injury now and let me tell ya<colon> it fucking sucks to work in a kitchen when your knife wrist is in constant pain. Always try to keep a straight wrist especially when doing repetitive work like cutting.<br><br>Keep the pointer grip for what it<sq>s best for<colon> off board precision cuts.

They<sq>re typically for the home cook that doesn<sq>t know what they<sq>re doing<dq> is a douchebag thing to say on several levels.<br><br>First of all, it<sq>s first world privledge bullshit because the FACT of the matter is that pressure cookers are used <dq>typically<dq> by people in this world because they live someplace where the fuel to cook their food is prohibitingly expensive. Sorry, there, Sean... But not everybody can just walk over to a gas burner, turn the knob and let it piss gas all day long. Get your head out of your ass. Be a little bit humble and aware that we throw out more food than most people have access to. <br><br>Secondly, it<sq>s a douchebag comment because although he hasn<sq>t ever used a pressure cooker before, guys with names like Thomas Keller, Grant Achatz and Heston Blumenthal have used them fairly regularly. Dave Arnold even uses a pressure cooker in reverse. That<sq>s called a roto vap. Now, granted, these guys are definitely <dq>newb casuals<dq> in comparison to a guy like Sean Telo but nonetheless, they aren<sq>t <dq>home cooks.<dq><br><br>Third, it<sq>s a douchbag comment because <dq>cooking<dq> something is basically just the application of heat and time to a food product. That heat and time and how they do their work is partially the result of pressure, atmospheric or otherwise. So, I<sq>m not sure what makes Sean Telo applying heat and time to a product different than a <dq>home cook<dq> doing it.<br><br>Lastly, and most importantly, here<sq>s why it<sq>s a douche bag comment. You<sq>re insulting generations of grandmas, moms, dads and families by suggesting that there<sq>s something that<sq>s <dq>amateurish<dq> or <dq>lesser<dq> about a home cook.

He was 1st generation italian, lived in New York and made the kind of pizza you desperately hope the hipsters think is like the pizza you make. And believe me when I tell you that he could cook circles around your silly narrow ass, young boy.. <br><br>The vast majority of people cooking at home, especially at the enthusiast level can and SHOULD be turning out dishes better than whatever you<sq>re serving at your restaurant, Sean. Unless you<sq>re running EMP (and you<sq>re pretty far from that, Sean) you still have to concern yourself with costs and profit margins that the home cooks that you<sq>re shitting on don<sq>t. I can<sq>t cook the same way that I cook <dq>at home<dq> when someone is paying me to cook for them. You know why? Because the prices I<sq>d have to charge to make a profit, paying customers are only willing to pay a list of about 5 guys in the whole world. And your name AIN<sq>T on that list, Sean.<br><br>Those of you who see me pretty regularly around here know that I<sq>m of the opinon that food is one of the last <dq>cultures<dq> that we have that we still are able to control.

Get some class and grow up a little Sean. You<sq>ll be taken more seriously.<br><br>Now, that out of the way, if you want to use a pressure cooker, use it. They<sq>re great tools to have and do things that are tough to achieve any other way. Everything that you said about a pressure cooker is true.

It states that if you cook them exactly the same and then put them in the oven until each comes up to temp, they preferred the cooked from frozen, even though they stated later than the thawed steaks have a better texture.  <br><br>The point of the fucking video is that the time taken to thaw a steak from frozen is a waste when you look at how a frozen steak can ultimately turn out if you cook it for 90 seconds on each side and thne throw it in the oven.  <br><br>Everyone who is saying <dq>well i don<sq>t freeze my steaks to begin with<dq> is also missing the goddamned point.  They aren<sq>t telling you to freeze your fucking steaks if you want a better steak.  They never even elude to that.  They say that if you have frozen steaks, then fucking sear them and finish in the oven and you have a steak in 20 minutes instead of waiting over an hour for it to thaw.<br><br>This isn<sq>t an exercise in whether steak cooked from frozen is preferable over steak that hasn<sq>t been frozen.  It is a look at whether taking the time to thaw frozen steaks is really important.  And it pretty much says that you will get a steak with less water loss and a inferior texture.  <br><br>THE POINT IS NOT THAT FROZEN STEAKS ARE A BETTER STARTING POINT.  THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU ARE FUCKING HUNGRY AND ONLY HAVE FROZEN STEAK< YOU SHOULD COOK THAT MOTHERFUCKER AND LEAVE YOUR PRETENTIOUSNESS AT THE DOOR FOR FORTY-FIVE MINUTES UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE EATEN YOUR GODDAMNED STEAK.</p>",

I believe they toast the sesame seeds prior to pressing. <br><br>You also need to understand that many Asian subcultures use different things to make the sauce. *Chinese* fried rice uses soy as the primary base. Korean (such as Kimchi fried rice) doesn<sq>t use soy at all, it uses something called Gochujang (yum!). Thai fried rice is something different completely and may contain coconut milk and/or sweet curry.<br><br>I prefer to use a mix of oyster sauce, with a dash of fish sauce and soy sauce. Soy is usually very tangy, so my mix leans heavily on the oyster sauce to add a dominant, rich flavor, with the other two added for lightly tangy overtones. I also tend to mix a tiny bit of sweet curry into the mix. This is a complimentary flavor for things like chicken, garlic, peas, scallion, jalapeno, golden raisins, peanut/cashew, and carrots. When considering meat, use the fatty portions cut small (e.g. leg, thigh, and back meat from a chicken vs the breast). <br><br>1. Heat the wok.<br>2. Heat the oil. Do the egg. Remove.<br>3. Add more oil. The oil should not be smoking. It should be shimmering, about to smoke. *Burning oil will add a distinct and unpleasant flavor to your food*.<br>3. Add the rice. Work it around to soften. Break up the chunks.<br>4. Add the sauce. Work around for a minute or 3.<br>5. Add the meat and veggies. <br>6. Fry for a while. Do not stir constantly.<br><br>Different types of fried rice may have different processes (Kimchi fried rice asks you to put the kimchi and other items in first, to put a braise on them, *then* add the rice.<br><br>I also tend to let my rice dry out completely uncovered. The rice can get *really* dry and still be usable. <br><br>If your rice is sticking to the pan, you are doing one or two things wrong.<br><br>1. Not enough fat. (add more sesame oil)<br>2. You did not wash the rice. Wash the starch off your rice prior to cooking. You **have to do this**. Many of us caucasians don<sq>t wash rice.

My mother would put me on the counter and let me smell each tin or bottle in the spice drawer. One after the other, over and over. My father would make candy or other sweets whenever my mother was away in the evening.  Kitchen time was happy, focused pleasure. I am not the sugar artist my father was, but for almost 40 years, I have been plopping diapered butts on the counter to smell the spices. I follow up with an offer to scramble an egg with their favorite one.<br><br>Some of the kids have developed great skills; others are just kitchen competent. They all went through picky eater phases, which we just ignored. Kids are picky either from genuine need to limit certain kinds of stimulus or from a power grab.  We did not choose to play. A kid won<sq>t starve themselves unless the emotional reward is high enough to offset the physical pain. We always talk honestly about what we like and don<sq>t like on the table. There is no shame in not liking the beets you mother has been craving since Christmas or the pickled daikon that everyone else is piling high on bahn mih. <br><br>If a kid is consistently not liking something, I serve an alternative with it, without comment. ATM I have one who is grossed out by the texture of lima beans. When we have limas, we also have celery sticks, which she loves, so there is a green veg for her, but no fuss,no muss, no emotional games around what should be a pure pleasure.<br><br>I also have a grandson, not currently in residence, though he has been for more than half his life.  He shows every sign of carrying on a family tradition of truly excellent cooks.  He, like his father, has been interested from the very first egg I scrambled for him, with sage. His father<sq>s choice was cinnamon.  The grandson loves going shopping for food, considering ingredients. It speaks to him to touch, smell and see possible foods. We have fun bringing home a find and figuring out how to make it dinner.<br><br>...what a fun thing to reflect on! Thanks for asking.</p>",

Our house rule is that he has to try a bite of everything, and if he doesn<sq>t like it, fine.  It<sq>s worked out to an extent.  About 6 months ago, he discovered he liked chicken, which he had previously hated.  But the 1 bite rule worked out and once he tried it, he ate a whole drumstick.

                "answer": "<p>Because heat is transferred via diffusion, and hot air in an oven is inefficient at conducting heat, starting low and finishing high gives you much more control than the opposite. Starting in a low oven (I actually prefer 200-250F), will slowly cook the chicken through without a large heat gradient occurring. The slow cooking will also slowly break down the connective tissue in the leg and thigh, while keeping the breast relatively moist. <br><br>Once the chicken is cooked through, remove from the oven and raise the temperature to 500F+, allowing the chicken to cool at room temperature for about 30-45 minutes (which allows the core of the meat to drop). At this point your chicken is already perfectly cooked, now all you need is to pop the chicken back in the oven long enough for the skin to crisp.<br><br>Starting the chicken in a hot oven and then dropping the temperature allows you to skip the resting step from above, but in my opinion, gives less consistent results. </p>",

If you crisp the skin and then cook it slow, some of the moisture within the bird will work its way to the outside and make it soggy again.<br><br>Also, depending on your oven type, you might have to worry about over-browning the skin.  There are two methods of heat exchange going on between the bird and the oven - convection and radiant heat.  If you darken the skin of the bird early in the cooking process, it will absorb more radiant heat, because less will be reflected away.  This rationale is pretty minor compared to the soggy skin issue, though.</p>",

Darker roux thicken less than an equal amount of lighter roux, while also having stronger, more complex flavors. These flavors may not be appropriate for all applications, however.<br><br>Use a corn starch slurry for last-minute thickening of highly flavored and balanced sauces. It<sq>s good to finish a pan sauce, or to bring a sauce together when the flavors are developed enough and you don<sq>t want to or don<sq>t have time to reduce it further. It<sq>s also very useful for vegetarian sauces because you<sq>ll generally lack access to the stocks and gelatin that are what normally thickens a sauce as it reduces.<br><br>Always add corn starch at the last minute, don<sq>t try to cool, store, and reheat food thickened with it.

As a good example, in the U.S. butter has to have no less than 80<percent> fat content to pass inspection by the USDA. European butter has to have no more than 15.9<percent> moisture content (IIRC, it might be 16.9<percent>) to pass their inspection. The standards for salted butter for most companies we worked with was that it could contain no less than 1.2<percent> and no more than 1.5<percent> (with the goal being 1.35<percent>) salt.<br><br>So, to break this into simple terms<colon><br><br>Most American Salted butter will be approximately 80<percent> fat, 1.5<percent> salt and 18.5<percent> moisture.<br><br>Most American Unsalted butter will be approximately 80<percent> fat and 20<percent> moisture.<br><br>Most European Salted butter will be approximately 82.6<percent> fat, 1.5<percent> salt and 15.9<percent> moisture.<br><br>Most European Unsalted butter will be approximately 84<percent> fat and 15.9<percent> moisture.<br><br>There are also American <dq>European Style<dq> butters that have approximately 82<percent> fat, with the moisture content adjusted to reflect that.<br><br>So, in 1 stick of butter there are 8 tablespoons. Convert that to teaspoons (for easier conversion down the line) and you have 24 teaspoons of butter. 24 * 0.012 = .288 tsp, or just over 1/4 tsp salt in a stick of butter minimum. 24 * 0.015 = 0.36 tsp, or just over 1/3 tsp at the high end (although some companies can go up to 2<percent> salt, which gives us just under 1/2 tsp of salt in 1 stick of butter).<br><br>So, if a recipe calls for multiple sticks of butter, the salt content can add up. Also, if you<sq>re using European butter, the fat content of the salted butter will be lower than it<sq>s unsalted counterpart, which can have varied effects from richness to texture.<br><br>Bottom line, using salted butter in place of unsalted butter won<sq>t kill you, but it can have undesired results since you can<sq>t always control the salt content or fat.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>I know in restaurants they deep fry it like someone else here said. Unless you have a method of doing this at home already it<sq>s probably not worth buying a fryer. This is what I do that has gotten me really close. I usually get extra firm tofu from the store. First cut the tofu, then put papers towels on top of the tofu and underneath the tofu. Then get a pan that is big enough to fit all the tofu in at one, but it<sq>s ok if they crowd the pan a little. Just make sure all the tofu can make contact with the bottom of the pan at the same time. Next add some oil (olive or vegetable) probably 2-3 tsp but make sure there a decent amount and turn it to medium/high. When it<sq>s hot fry the tofu on one side for 5-7min, wait until it yellows, then browns a lot! The first time I did it I was worried about burning if that give you a good idea on how long. Then do the same thing on the other side, this should take a little shorter than the first side. Throughout the whole process if you notice that the oil amount has decreased make sure you add more. I usually add more oil at least once or twice during the process. Once it<sq>s done then you can add it to whatever sauce you want. Just wait until the sauce is done don<sq>t cook it for more than 5 minutes with the sauce. If you want it to absorb extra sauce keep it in the fridge with the sauce for a day or two before you eat it to let it soak in. One more tip, freezing and thawing beforehand helps with sauce absorption, since little holes are created in the tofu by ice expansion. I usually freeze 2 days before and then move it back to the fridge the day before. Also I<sq>ll take it out of the water and stick it in Tupperware for the freezing/thawing. Hope this helps and feel free to pm me if you have any other questions.</p>",

Well I assume you mean it<sq>s sweet, slightly acidic and feels <dq>bubbly<dq> or <dq>foamy<dq> in texture.  Obviously the acidity is from the high citric and ascorbic acid in the strawberries, the banana is pretty sweet so that covers those aspects, and on to <dq>bubbly<dq>....  <br>We can say for sure that the blending process will aerate the mixture and trap microscopic bubbles.  But you might say, <dq>That was hour ago!<dq>. It was, however you have created some extremely stable bubbles!   The lifetime of a bubble is based off of 2 main properties, the viscosity of the substance the bubble is in, and the surface tension of the the substance.  (which are often related but can be different. Honey for example is very thick but has very little surface tension).  The Chia seeds are a well known thickening agent and lipid-carbohydrate surfactant, this gives the smoothie a very high internal friction, so the bubbles can<sq>t <dq>move up<dq> effectively trapping the air.  Most almond milks contain [Carrageenan](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan) which is also a surfactant stabilizers, however since it forms strong 1-4 glucose bonds it forms high surface tension networks around dissimilar agents.  It this way it helps to stabilize colloids, (liquid with material homogeneously floating in it, like Jello) in this case, stabilizing the bubbles and preventing the air from diffusing back into the liquid.  <br><br>TL;DR- Blending makes bubbles. Carrageenan from Almond milk makes the bubbles strong.  chia seeds makes the bubbles slow. 1-3 hours later... still have bubbles. </p>",

Frying at a lower temperature tends to create a thicker crust that when cooled will tend to absorb more oil than cooking at a higher temperature. <br><br>They list several factors that can impact the oil absorption in foods, age of oil (older means more viscous and more greasy), size of food, and temperature. <br><br>Now the difference between frying french fries (as was used as an example in another comment) and the OP<sq>s chicken is pretty different because with fries you are dealing with a singular product whereas with the chicken you are dealing with a coating as well as chicken that needs to be cooked. IMO, if you treated the OP<sq>s chicken like the ATK folks did the fries you would end up with a very thick, hard crust on the chicken and it would absorb more grease then cooking at a higher temperature for less time. With wings you are really looking for that goldilocks zone. <br><br>The fries method works for the ATK people because it eliminates the parcooking steps in what many consider to be the traditional/best way to cook fries. If you parboiled the fries to cook the interior and then fried them at a high temperature the grease levels would likely be very comparable. </p>",

The heat distribution of an oven really comes down to the specific design, that being said, there are some rules of thumb.<br><br>Generally speaking you need to maintain an air gap between each product in an oven, to allow the heat to properly circulate. If its a deep tin, and the product doesn<sq>t come all the way up, you can get away with half of the tin height again, but for most things, you want double the height of each pie between shelves. So there<sq>s basically equal amounts of air and pie in your oven.<br><br>However many pies you are able to fit in your oven, I would divide your baking time by that, and move the pies around in your oven, to equalise cooking. So take the top one out, move them all up, and put the top one on the bottom. When you do this, remember to also turn them around as well (90 degrees if theres 4, 120 if there<sq>s 3, etc.). <br><br>For 20 pies, you want disposable pie tins. Otherwise you<sq>d be there all day waiting for tins to be free so you can make the next batch. Supermarkets should have appropriate sized ones - if not, any kitchen supply store will. <br><br>Make your bases all at once. I<sq>m not sure about your recipe, but off the top of my head, an american pumpkin pie is usually a flan, so you<sq>re not likely to be par baking them. Probably a shortbread base of some sort? Make your base in as big a batch as you feel comfortable with. Roll it out in portions. Use one of the tins as a rough guide, and cut out the pastry for each one. When you do this, you want to leave enough space around the edge of the tin to properly line the edges, as well as have extra to trim off properly. <br><br>Roll and cut out all of the bases first, remembering to make sure each is decently floured before you stack them up. Then make all 20 bases at once. <br><br>With your filling, divy it up into batches to fill as many pies as you can fit in your oven at once. Have the second batch ready to go as soon as the first is done. First rule of mass pastry production is always keep the ovens working.

For starters it is very apparent that he was not present at all for the majority of location filming. This makes sense in some ways as I am sure he is a busy guy, but to hear him talking about some of these people and their situations from the comfort of his nice home in Northern California caused a lot of dissonance for me.<br><br>* Terrible scientific content. I was excited when I first saw the Modernist guys on there. I have worked with Nathan Myhrvold and Chef Migoya in the past, Chef Migoya is a brilliant artist and scientist and they both have a massive passion for food and science. Unfortunately their segments seemed heavily edited and spread between two episodes. The bread episode had a ton of scientific misinformation that came across as pseudo-mysticism.<br><br>* The horrendous contradictions in the India episode and the blatant skirting of the issues present in it. The fact that they were playing music that sounded like it was the soundtrack to a horror movie or a theme for an evil empire while they were showing a Nestle facility in India. I am not the biggest fan of Nestle as a company, but they were literally playing evil music while a bunch of women were doing a focus group as if it was bringing on the downfall of mankind. They juxtapose that with this woman and her daughter who home cook meals for people and they make a whopping 60 or 70 something dollars a MONTH. Additionally they rope in this family with an obesity issue, where both parents work about 12 hour days, but make decent income and are able to provide a non poverty lifestyle for their family. Pollan idealizes this system of these poverty stricken women making <dq>home cooked<dq> meals for the community over the <dq>out of touch<dq> family that has two people generating decent income because they make poor food choices and eat a lot of KFC.<br><br>* The first episode with the theme of Fire was really neat and they stuck to the theme. Water, Air and Earth all totally dropped the idea of sticking with the theme. From a food science perspective water is the most prevalent thing in our foods, and they missed a huge opportunity to explore that. Additionally the Earth theme was a perfect episode to examine agricultural systems and how they have developed in different countries and how they create different food systems. Instead the Earth episode was about microbial ecology (partially)... That should have been the Air episode, and the bread should have been in the Water episode. Aside from the first episode they totally failed to properly frame these elements as themes.<br><br><br>I have a lot more but those are probably my top criticisms. For me I think the biggest turn off was just Pollan in general. His obvious bias with no critical thinking or answers, his dismissal of science in many cases, and the entire feeling of him just saying <dq>Oh yeah I<sq>d love to do a documentary, can we just film all my parts at my house so I don<sq>t have to go with you guys for any of this stuff?

I hate them and find them more of a pain in the ass than any improvement in the cake quality.  getting the cake out of the pan requires chilling it overnight but that is not a problem if you plan accordingly-the process is a conversation on its own.<br><br>the final reason cheesecakes crack and truly the most obvious when you think about it, it isn<sq>t a cake; cheesecake is actually a custard baked in a crust.  the custard seals itself to the sides of the pan during the baking process and during the cooling process, it needs to contract.  if the sides are stuck to the pan, the only place it can contract and crack is the middle.  so never check your cake for doneness using a knife stuck into the middle of the cake-it gives it a place to crack and always run a knife around the edge of the pan to release the cake from it about 3/4 of the way through the baking.  this way, as the cake cools and contracts, the entire cake shrinks without splitting.</p>",

I also cook asian food at home. <br><br>Here are tips<colon> <br><br>1) Use a hot seasoned wok. Super hot! The hotter the wok, the more the wok will cause a singed/smokey (but not burnt) flavor in your food and that is what you want. If you have an electric stove, you need to preheat the wok in the oven and cross your fingers. <br><br>2) tenderize/velvet your meat by letting it sit in a egg white/corn starch mixture before boiling/deep frying. If you want something that<sq>s 3x as easy but only half as good, use a water/baking soda mixture. <br><br>3) Cook your meals on high heat and do not add too much at once. Add sauces after everything is essentially done cooking. <br><br>4) Most sauce mixtures are a combination of soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, salt, water, corn starch, rice vinegar, minced garlic, chicken broth, minced ginger, minced chili peppers, and premade condiments such as oyster, hoisin, black bean, and sriracha. You cant always just toss soysauce on food and hope for a complex sauce. Play around and try to develop 3 different sauce recipes by using/omitting those items (certainly don<sq>t just toss them all together).<br><br>5) Generally what you want to do is heat your wok, flavor oil with aromatics, reserve some oil, cook your meat, set aside, bring wok back to heat, add reserved oil, cook your veg, add your meat back in, reduce heat, add your sauce and toss until thickened and finished. Serve over rice. <br><br>Good luck. Btw, are you german? </p>",

You put the meat in a ziplock bag, submerge it to squeeze out the air, seal it and put it in a container filled with water at the right temperature. I generally leave one probe thermometer in the thickest part of the meat and another in the water bath to monitor the water temperature, and I also find that I can keep the temperature pretty accurate by putting the whole apparatus in my sink and turning on the hot water tap once in a while. Not as accurate as real sous vide, but the steaks come out awesome after a sear. (When I don<sq>t care to go to the trouble of doing this, I use /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt<sq>s formidable reverse sear method). <br><br>2) Thickening with xanthan gum<colon> This stuff is magical. Find a small bag of it, as you will never use more than a teaspoon of the stuff at a time; my local non-chain grocery store sells Bob<sq>s Red Mill brand. Disperse it into any liquid and watch it thicken instantly. Turn water into Jell-O. It is remarkable stuff. It has replaced flour and cornstarch for me in many applications, because it acts instantly, is temperature-independent and has no flavor. Typically I use about a half teaspoon for making gravy. It is important to be careful when dispersing it because it clumps<colon> in general you should strain whatever you thicken with it before serving. <br><br>**Edit<colon>** for those curious about the fake sous vide technique, [here](http<colon>//www.nytimes.com/video/dining/100000001265554/in-the-kitchen-with-nathan-myhrvold.html) is an excellent video of Nathan Myhrvold demonstrating the technique on a dish of salmon in spiced hazelnut butter, for the New York Times.</p>",

As for serving/ garnish, the most basic way to present it would be twirling the pasta into a loop, and nestling the scallop on top. Try to create some height by using the pasta as a platform.

Use a very sharp knife or a potato peeler to remove the yellow zest while avoiding the white skin that would make limoncello bitter. Cut zest in small stripes and put them in a jar with 750ml of alcohol in a dark and cool place for one month. Shake it lightly from time to time.<br><br>When the month has passed, boil 1.5lt of water and dissolve 1.2kg of sugar in it, then let it cool down. Then, pour this syrup and the remaining 250ml of alcohol in the jar containing the zest, and let it rest for 40 more days in a dark and cool place. <br><br>When the 40 days are over, open the jar and filter its content using a canvas so that the resulting liquid is completely clean.

Put the zest in a jar, add all the alcohol, and hermetically close it.<br><br>Remove the white part from the lemons, squeeze them and filter the juice. Put the juice in a pot, add the water and the sugar and make it boil. Let it cool, put it in another jar and hermetically close it, too.<br><br>Let rest the two jars for two weeks.<br><br>After the two weeks, pour together the content of the two jars and let it rest for 24 hours. Then, filter it using a canvas and put it in a bottle. After a month, limoncello is ready.<br><br>Edit<colon> by the way, I am sorry but as an Italian I have to say that using vodka to make limoncello is an abomination and utterly unacceptable.

It is often far more convenient to be able to just have loose pages and not a whole book, especially if you have limited counter space. Also very nice when you are using two different recipes at once, now you dont need to flip back and forth between pages.<br><br>The different sections (Breakfast, Poultry, Soups, etc) are tabbed so that you can easily get to the page you are looking for. <br><br>They have reviews the cooking utensils/appliances that every chef should have at home, as well as reviews of some basic ingredients (eg. best tomato sauce, or best olive oil).<br><br>They have tables for your standard conversions and substitutions. Need to know what to substitute for buttermilk, they got it. Only have measuring spoons in mL but the recipe asks for tsps, you<sq>re covered.<br><br>Almost every recipe comes with 2-3 variations on the basic recipe they present. So once you<sq>ve mastered their basic risotto you can instantly change it up and do asparagus risotto with mint and lemon, or saffron risotto. Perfect for someone who doesnt have the full confidence to experiment on their own.<br><br>They have excellent photos and descriptions to actually *teach* you how to execute what the recipes call for. For instance, when they say <sq>dice an onion<sq> they will have a page describing how to best dice an onion. This book actually teaches you what is meant when they say <dq>Fold an egg<dq>. They will have photos showing what your meal *should* look like, but also what it might look like if you cooked at too high a temperture or if you over-mixed the batter. This allows you to quickly diagnose what you did wrong and fix it next time, rather than blindly guessing on how you screwed up. This is so valuable for a new cook.<br><br>I could go on forever on these cookbooks. The BEST cookbook for someone who wants to learn.

If you don<sq>t want to buy all 4 (or 2 double-sided) stones at once then start with the coarsest grits, they<sq>re the most important. Naniwa and Shapton are two brands that come in mind.They both use the Japanese grit system (I believe the JIS standard), so then the grits 240-800-2000-6000 would make sense, although you can vary with that quite a bit. You can go from much coarser like 80 grit I believe, to a much finer grit like 20000. Super fine stones are also super expensive, I suggest to get a strop (with or without compound). Stropman is a brand that comes in mind, although any plain leather surface (I use the inside of a belt) glued on a plank would work as a strop. If you want to use compound (it speeds up the stropping and if you get a fine grit you can mirror-finish edges with it). You can get a compound made for shaving strops. Stropping is usually 1 or 2 stages, so with 1 or 2 different grain sizes of compound (if compound is used at all).<br><br>Stones and strops are good for all kinds of knives (except ceramic knives, don<sq>t get those in the first place), cheap or expensive, Japanese or European style. There<sq>s an exception for blades with strong recurves and serrations, but kitchen knives don<sq>t have recurves at all in general. If you know how to sharpen well you don<sq>t even need a serrated knives IMO, I usually cut bread and such with a plain knife. For more questions you might want to post to /r/knifeclub next time.

Rather than break it on the flat portion of your counter, use the edge. When you crack it on the flat part of the counter, you are breaking the shell by denting it and creating lots of unevenly jagged edges. If you break it on the edge you are creating more of a linear puncture that is less likely to have big jagged bits sticking off, which will snag the yolk. From there, straight to the pan and drop the egg very close to the preheated pan without touching it. I usually drop the egg from 1-2 inches above the pan. Practice next time you make bake a cake or make pancakes. </p>",

Meaning both that you shouldn<sq>t be afraid to experiment, and that you need to keep in mind that items that are more highly flavored go well with the relatively large proportion of rice in typical sushi. That<sq>s why stronger fish like salmon, tuna, eel, and mackerel are better for sushi than mild flavored fish. So think salty, spicy, smoky.<br><br>I<sq>m in Hawaii, where they will stick just about anything in sushi or on a musubi (rice ball). Since rice is a three-meals-a-day habit here, putting things together with rice is second nature. Hot dogs (quartered lengthwise), Spam, spicy fried chicken, scrambled eggs, pickled radish (takuwan), smoked sausage (linguica, chorizo, or whatever is popular where you are). The California Roll combination of crab salad, cucumber, and avocado is popular. Simple tuna salad (canned tuna and mayonnaise, not too wet) and cucumber are a good combination good too. I used to go to a place where the chef made sushi with the brown, salty rind from prime rib. <br><br>I would suggest you start by experimenting with a bowl of warm rice and an assortment of potential fillings. Eat a little rice with some of each candidate and see how well they go together. So much easier than going to the trouble of making a whole roll of sushi just for a taste. Once you get good combinations, experiment with proportions of rice to fillings.<br><br>The bottom line is that it doesn<sq>t have to be the standard fare you<sq>d find in a traditional sushi bar. It can be incredibly individual and personal.<br><br>I would draw the line, however, at cheese. Cheese and rice just don<sq>t go together as far as I<sq>m concerned.<br><br><br></p>",

When it<sq>s lunch time, I just let some air in, re-close the lid, and shake it up. Lazy person salad express. I also make my own dressing and keep it in old jam jars.

Quoting the salient parts<colon><br><br>> A lot of cookbooks and videos will attempt to give you the <dq>authentic<dq> kind; I myself was consistently disappointed until I found the key. Or keys, actually. A few things they tend to do wrong<colon><br>><br>> * **Too little onion**. The gravy in Indian food is *based* on onions. It<sq>s what gives the sauce its smooth body; it acts as a thickener and a very subtle but important flavour enhancer. Can<sq>t make Indian food without it. It<sq>s not just one onion chopped and then <dq>fried for 5 minutes until translucent<dq>. No \u2014 you need a whole bunch of onions, cooked (sweated) until tender and then *blended into a fine pulp*. Some Indian restaurants will also cook the onions with peppers, cabbage and tomatoes, among other things. Sweating the onions for 45-60 minutes is absolutely paramount. Sweated onions develop complex aromatics that taste completely differently from onions that have been just lightly fried in some oil.<br>><br>> * **Too much unconcentrated tomato**. Rather, a lot of recipes call for you to plop in a can of chopped tomatoes. This makes no sense<colon> Tomatoes have a lot of water, so you don<sq>t get a concentrated gravy out of this, not unless you cook it for hours. It<sq>s the same shoddy deception as the classic cook-book illusion that pretends you can caramelize onions in five minutes. No, you need tomato *paste*<colon> A really concentrated reduction of tomato.<br>><br>> * **No ginger-garlic paste**. One of the cornerstones of Indian food (and coincidentally also some middle-eastern cuisines and Thai) is the ginger-garlic paste, but it almos never comes up in recipes. In India you<sq>ll find jars of this in the supermarket. Making your own is better. It<sq>s what it says<colon> Chopped garlic and ginger, minced in a blender until a fine paste.<br>><br>> * **They skip the blending step**. A lot of recipes ask you to combine chopped onions, tomatoes, spices and what not, and you get this chunky mess that is nothing like a true tikka masala. All the flavour is distributed in bits of onion, bits of coriander, watery tomato sauce. A great tikka masala sauce must be blended for about 5-6 minutes until perfectly smooth.<br>><br>> * **Not enough fenugreek**. This one is a matter of preference. I think tikka masala absolutely needs to be made with (a modest amount of) fenugreek leaves. To me, it<sq>s what turns something good into something awesome.<br>><br>> * **Not enough paneer**. Again, this is a matter of preference. Some cooks apparently only add paneer to butter chicken, not tikka masala. For me, the sauce is exactly the same thing (and historically, I think that is right<colon> tikka masala is butter chicken sauce + tikka chicken). Anyway, adding crumbled paneer to a sauce makes it a lot better.<br>><br>> The only recipe I have found to match the stuff you find in restaurants is an ebook by a British cook named Julian Voigt<colon> [**The Secret to That Takeway Curry Taste**](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/Secret-That-Takeway-Curry-Taste-ebook/dp/B008N2B0OC). It<sq>s amazing. (I<sq>m not affiliated with the author, just a happy customer.)<br>><br>> Voigt runs a small <dq>BIR<dq>-style (British Indian Restaurant, pretty much what you associate with Indian food in the West) takeout place in England. His own recipes come from recipes he learned by working in Indian restaurants before he started his own. And unlike many recipes which claim to be <dq>authentic<dq>, they truly are. The book is charmingly amateurishly put together and completely unpretentious.<br>><br>> Voigt<sq>s recipe is basically a three-step process, from memory<colon><br>><br>> * Onion gravy base. This is, at its most basic, sweated onions + lots of neutral vegetable oil + fresh chili + some tomatoes + garam masala, cooked for about 90 minutes and then blended until perfectly smooth. The base smells like old gym socks and has a brown, goopy, unappealing exterior. It<sq>s used as the base for the actual sauce.<br>><br>> * Tikka masala sauce base. This is yogurt + tomato paste + spice paste + red food dye. Voigt uses a combination of several off-the-shelf Indian spice pastes as a shortcut.<br>><br>> * Final sauce = heat onion base, add a few spoonfuls of tikka masala sauce base + ginger-garlic paste + coriander leaves + coconut powder (aka coconut flour; a BIR oddity, I believe, but it does makes the sauce mellower) + fenugreek leaves + paneer (optional, it<sq>s not in the book) + a little heavy cream to finish.<br>><br>> The whole book is made from the perspective of a restaurant chef, so everything is scaled to large batches. That<sq>s why the sauce bases are separate. The nice thing is that you can make 5 liters of onion base and freeze what you don<sq>t need; the onion base can be used for all sorts of dishes since it<sq>s pretty flavour-neutral.<br>><br>> I highly recommend the book.<br></p>",

                "answer": "<p>I have spent the better part of 3 years perfecting the recipe for Butter Chicken and I am now sharing it with you. First some basics. There are lots of variations within an Indian dish depending on what proportion of masalas you put in there but there are certain flavor profiles which are important to maintain for certain dishes. For Butter chicken the flavor profile is a) Roast Chicken (or Tandoori) added to b) Tomato gravy with a predominant <dq>green cardamom<dq> and <dq>mace<dq> (Javitri) flavor. Skip either and you don<sq>t have butter chicken.<br><br>This is how I make it<colon><br>**Prep<colon>**<br>* Chicken<colon> Take 2-3 Chicken thighs, remove the skin, make rough slits in the meat and put salt + 1 Teaspoon red chilli powder + 1 Teaspoon Garam Masala. Rub it in well. Now put one Tablespoon oil on the legs, rub it in and keep it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.<br><br>* Soak 7-8 Cashew nuts in hot water until they are soft (30-40 minutes).<br><br>**The Gravy (Serves 2-3)<colon>**<br>a) Take a big sauce pan (Indian deep cooking pot kadai).  <br>b) Put 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.  <br>c) Put whole spices<colon> 4 Cloves + 5 slightly crushed green Cardamoms + 1 Black Cardamom + 1 small piece of Mace (one inch long) + small piece of Cinnamon + 1 teaspoon Cumin Seeds (Jeera) + 1 big bay leaf.<br>Do not put anything else. Saute them for 2 min. Add 2 garlic pods roughly chopped.  <br>d) Put 2 medium sized chopped onions and saute for 4 minutes (until they turn translucent), no need to caramelize.  <br>e) Put 6 medium sized roughly chopped Tomatoes. Saute the whole thing together for another 5 minutes max until the tomatoes just start to go mush. Do not overcook this or your gravy will turn watery.  <br>f) Transfer to a mixer, add the cashew nuts, put a cloth on top of the lid (it<sq>s hot) and blend it!  <br>g) Pour it back into the pot. It will start to splutter badly. Now the golden touch, Add half a jar (200ml) of Chicken Stock (usually comes in 400ml glass jars) or same quantity of fresh chicken stock. This will give the <dq>Umami<dq> edge. Mix it well, put the lid on and let it simmer on medium heat.  <br>h) Keep mixing it after every 10 minutes or so.  <br>i) After the 25 min mark add the rest of the chicken stock (200ml). The magic time limit for cooking this sauce   is 45 minutes! It has to cook at least for 45 minutes in total, one hour on the stove optimum. The gravy will reduce down to the right amount after 40 minutes.  <br>h) Around the 35 minutes mark, Add 2 teaspoon of salt or according to taste, 1 teaspoon of Cumin powder, 1 teaspoon of Garam Masala, 1 teaspoon of red chilli powder.  <br>i) IMP<colon> Add two tablespoons of kasoori methi crushed.  <br>j) IMP<colon> Add a tablespoon of Tomato Ketchup and a pinch of sugar.  <br><br>Now the Gravy will start to come together, keep tasting. It<sq>s almost done.  <br><br>**Chicken<colon>**  <br>You can prepare it before you cook the gravy or while you are cooking it. I usually put the chicken in the oven around 20 min after I start cooking gravy.  <br>1. Preheat the oven to 200 degree Centigrade.  <br>2. place the chicken legs on aluminium foil in the top row of the oven just near the heating elements.  <br>3. Cook the upper side for 12 minutes.  <br>4. Then open the door, turn the sides and cook for another 8 minutes.  <br>5. Take it out, never cook it for more than 20!. Now let it cool. After it cools down, shred it with your fingers or with a fork and collect the meat in a bowl.  <br>6. You can also substitute market bought tandoori chicken.  <br>Do not ever use Chicken Breasts or Fried chicken breasts from a pan in this recipe. Those recipes turn out shit.   Its roasted chicken or tandoori chicken or else its not butter chicken.  <br><br>**Finishing<colon>**  <br>a) Around the 50 min mark, the gravy would have reached the desired quantity and the chicken shreds will be ready. Mix the two and keep the lid on medium low flame, simmer for 5 minutes.  <br>b) Switch off and take it off the flame. Add 4 Tablespoons of <dq>Fresh Cream<dq> or Whipping cream.  <br><br>Tasty Butter Chicken is ready.<br><br>**So all in all these factors are important<colon>**  <br>1. Cardamom and Mace flavor profile.  <br>2. Roasted Dark Meat Chicken (never ever ever use breasts).  <br>3. Using Chicken Stock as a gravy base.  <br>4. Using kasoori methi + ketchup + sugar.  <br>5. Cooking the gravy for at least 45 minutes.  <br><br>This will produce an elevated dish I guarantee you.<br><br>Edit<colon> I am an Indian, trust me on this <colon>)  <br>2nd Edit<colon> Forgot Garlic, formatting  <br><br></p>",

Basically, it<sq>s the temperature at which the fat starts to burn. Wikipedia has a [very nice list of smoke points](http<colon>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point) you can refer to. <br><br>~~I always add the oil to a cold pan and let both heat up together~~ (EDIT<colon> I<sq>ve been informed this is incorrect, unless you have a nonstick or cast iron. Otherwise, hot pan, cold oil.) As for a proper temperature, I can<sq>t say. It would depend on what you<sq>re cooking, but also on your fat. If you<sq>re saut\u00e9ing with butter, for example, you would want a temperature below 250-300, which is the point at which your butter will start to burn. Someone with a bit more knowledge might be able to say. When I<sq>ve pan fried steaks, for example, I just heat the pan up until the oil *just* begins to smoke before adding my meat, that way you get a nice crust.<br><br>A safe bet is that if you<sq>re cooking something you want to brown-up (Be it steak, potatoes, or chicken) then you want your pan around 300, which is the temperature at which the Maillard Reaction occurs best and you also want a fat that can handle that temperature.<br><br>As for the <dq>best<dq> fat for frying eggs, saut\u00e9ing potatoes, etc. there<sq>s no right answer and for the most part it all comes down to personal preference. I always cook my eggs in a bit of bacon fat, but I know people who have used margarine, as well as people who just use butter. I don<sq>t like either for frying eggs but, like I said, that<sq>s personal preference. Likewise, I<sq>ve seen recipes for home fries that call for butter, and others that call for oil. It really depends on what you<sq>re doing and what flavour you<sq>re looking for. Olive oil has more of it<sq>s own taste than a neutral oil like canola oil or peanut oil. Likewise, butter will make a richer meal. When it comes to saut\u00e9ing vegetables like spinach or kale, I love to use butter. If I<sq>m stir frying then I use canola oil.<br><br></p>",

This is just what I<sq>ve learned from my own experience.<br><br>The best fat is really up to you and your taste, but certain flavours will probably work better with certain oils.  Butter is good for steak and eggs; I prefer beef dripping or goose fat for roasted potatoes but I<sq>ve used standard shortening or sunflower oil when I had nothing else and it turned out all right.  If you have a very fatty piece of meat, you can likely just fry it in its own juices.  <br><br>The smoking point is just that<colon> the point at which something becomes so hot that it smokes.  If you put oil in a pan and set a high flame under it, eventually the oil will begin to give off smoke.  Certain oils have lower smoking points than others, and are therefore less suited to cooking at high temperatures.  You wouldn<sq>t want to cook a Chinese stir fry (over high high heat) with an oil that smokes at a low heat.<br><br>Cold oil to hot pan will stop the oil from burning and tasting nasty.  It also keeps the fresh flavour of the oil so that when you<sq>re finished cooking, you<sq>ll still get the nuances of that oil in the dish.<br><br>Temperature for the pan depends on what you<sq>re cooking.  Some foods require a screaming hot pan and smoking oil before you cook.  If you tried to sear a steak on a medium hot pan, it wouldn<sq>t turn out too well.

OR freeze it - seems to keep getting hotter.<br>Other spices (besides seasonings heavy on hot peppers) that are brutal and potentially dish ruining if multiplied straight out are Cardamom and Cloves, Any of the Anises, dried herbs like thyme -but not rosemary, interestingly, Saffron, hmmm - some Paprikas,Coriander, Allspice, and oh God, Nutmeg.<br>For a start, I would only double the spice for a 4x batch and taste it the next day.

Someone pointed me to this page, which has a similarly involved discussion on it<colon> http<colon>//www.latimes.com/features/food/dailydish/la-dd-one-easy-trick-for-perfect-poached-eggs-20130306,0,3455513.story<br><br>From a scientific standpoint, it makes no sense to me that spices would not be linear. Even tests that are designed to test their potency rely on their linearness when dissolved in water, which is essentially what<sq>s happening in most recipes (exception being some Indian or Chinese or other Asian dishes where flavor comes dissolved in oil, not water). I<sq>ve also been able to find zero empirical evidence to demonstrate why there would be an exception for the specific spices you<sq>ve mentioned, which seems odd if it were actually true.<br><br>The most likely explanation I can think of is the imprecision of volumetric measurements, and the compression of spices in larger volumes. A cup of chili powder, for instance, weighs much more than 16 tablespoons, which in turn weighs much more than 48 teaspoons, because the spices at the bottom of the cup are more compressed than they are in the tablespoon or teaspoon.<br><br>You can demonstrate this very easily with flour. Measure out 16 tablespoons into a bowl and weigh it. Then scoop out a cup from the bag using a cup measure and weigh it. He one from the up will weigh somewhere between 25 and 50<percent> more, depending on how strong you are.<br><br>Using recipes that offer weights, not volumes, should prevent this from happening.<br><br>The easiest way to do this is t measure and combine your spice mixes in bulk, then calculate how much you need for a given quantity of food and weigh it out. For instance, when I make a certain curry, I know that I need 2<percent> of the weight of the meat in spices and 1.5<percent> in salt. I can easily measure the spices out of a pre mixed blend that I<sq>ve already batched according to my original ratios, then add that salt.<br><br>The Bly other thing you<sq>d have to compensate for is reduction through evaporation, which will intensify the potency all of your flavors, including saltiness.<br><br>If anyone has source material for a scientifically tested result on this issue, I<sq>d love to see it. If true (which I have trouble believing), it<sq>s fascinating!<br><br>And heck, this is so interesting that I<sq>m going to run this exact test next week and have it tasted double blind to make sure. I<sq>ll test scaling recipes both volumetrically and by weight, and test recipes that use liquid (dissolved) spices vs. surface (rubbed) spices of different kinds.

It<sq>s probably mostly accurate for a double batch, but you<sq>re more likely to be off if you want to 10x the quantity.

It was perfectly cooked, e.g. no mushy areas or over dried areas.  My old cheap rice cooker that I got for $10 or $20 was so inconsistent, sometimes I got rice that was too mushy or sometimes it was too hard.  Frankly, sometimes I am even lazy with watching how accurately I fill the water up to the line in the pot and it still comes out perfect.  I think the taste is definitely better.<br><br>I use mine about once or twice a week, or at the very least, once every two weeks.  It was definitely worth the initial investment, because it is easy to clean, makes all kids of rice perfectly (imho), can be set to cook at a certain time of day, and keeps rice warm for quite a long time without changing the texture (two settings on that too, keep warm long or short amount of time).  I use it probably about as often as I use an oven, so logically it is a good investment.<br><br>Fuzzy logic means that it measures the temperature of the rice while cooking and adjusts the heat accordingly.  I think that it<sq>s a major part in the great consistency it always puts out.  The pressurized induction part, I am not sure if you would be able to improve on how well it already does with just the fuzzy logic, but I have never tried rice from one of the fancier ones, so I can<sq>t really say.<br><br>If I had to do it over, or of something happened to mine (though they have a great reputation for build quality and service), I would buy it again.

Induction cooking will always have hot spot at the coil, and it will not ruin your food like they claim.  The pressurized steam cooking thing, yes it will create a different texture but that is only if you are not using a standard cooking ratio (but using a less water and use steam as a main heating / cooking method).  Yes, it will keep your rice warmer and the optimal texture longer, but you can do that even without the pressurized steam chamber, just before you eat the rice and if you find it slightly on the drier / stale side, throw in 2 to 3 Tbs of hot water while you mixing the rice and cover, let sit for 2 minutes in the warming cycle.<br><br>There is a reason why rice cooker design hasn<sq>t change for a long time, because all it need is a heating element and a auto cut off when all the water has evaporated.  The reason why there are more and more functions being added to a rice cooker is because 1, it is just a marketing gimmic. 2, because most developed big cities of asia that would use rice cooker have limited space at home, where one cooking instruments can carry out multiple duty have a better selling point than a single one.  But the fact is, no one in asia use a rice cooker (even if it is multi-purpose) to steam veggie or cook porridge, or slow cook or whatever function it has on it other than cooking rice, because we have other tools to do those things better.<br><br>http<colon>//www.panasonic.hk/chinese/products/kitchen/rice-cooker/sr-spx183.aspx<br><br>This rice cooker above is one of the most expensive out there.

Instead of relying on a measuring cup or lines on the side of pot, use this method that we asian use.<br><br>* Wash your rice thoroughly (multiple times till water is mostly clear)<br>* Drain the washed rice from water<br>* Put in water (good starting point is the typical 1 cup rice <colon> 1.5 cup water)<br>* Measure water level with the back of your hand touching the surface of rice and see water line on hand<br>* Cook and experiment for optimal water level</p>",

                "answer": "<p>* [Here](http<colon>//static4.businessinsider.com/image/516340f1ecad044d7d000013/how-to-pick-the-perfect-cut-of-beef.jpg) is a diagram designed to specifically identify each cut and where it comes from and how much of the steak is made up of that cow.  Cheaper cuts would include sirloin, flank, and skirt, or cheffy cuts like hanger and flatiron. The four best cuts are the ribeye, the strip the tenderloin and the T-bone. [Here](http<colon>//www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/the-four-high-end-steaks-you-should-know-ribeye-strip-tenderloin-t-bone.html) is an article posted by serious eats that gives you a break down of each cut, where it comes from and the best way to cook it. The tenderness of the steak directly relates to the how much and long the muscle is used. The lest it is used the more tender the meat will be. In the cows case we are looking at the loin. If we look back at the graph we can see we have the short loin and the sirloin. The short loin is where we get those expensive cuts that we mentioned earlier, excluding the ribeye which, well, comes from the rib.  <br><br>* There are three qualifications for grades USDA Prime, USDA Choice, and USDA Select. There are two factors that determine which cut gets what grade. That<sq>s maturity and marbling. USDA Prime will have anywhere from slightly abundant to abundant marbling, Choice will have small to moderate, Select will only have slight. A Standard cut of beef is when the meat is practically devoid of marbling.  If you would like a break down of how they determine this and to see a chart that is used check out [Department of Animal Research](http<colon>//meat.tamu.edu/beefgrading/) done at Texas A&amp;M. If you prefer a video visual [here](https<colon>//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnxa4gS36b8) is a segment ABC did on the visual difference of grades. This can also help you identify each cut. Maturity refers to the physiological age of the animal, not the chronological, as we never know how old the animal actually is. Some of the indicators are bone characteristics, ossification of cartilage, color and texture of ribeye muscle. Then we have categories within those indicators that are used to give the cut a grade. As far as grass fed beef it is led to believe that the steak will always have better marbling because the cow is allowed to <sq>fatten<sq> naturally. Outlined [here](http<colon>//www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/03/29/grass.grain.beef.cookinglight/) is an article CNN did on the differences between grain and grass fed cattle. <br><br>* My personal opinion for seasoning would have to do with the cut being used. For a lower quality steak like hanger, I will most always marinade it. For higher quality, less seasoning is more and I might finish it with a compound butter. Somewhere in between and I will have fun with it. To be more precise [here](http<colon>//culinaryarts.about.com/od/beefporkothermeats/a/Seasoning-A-Steak.htm) is a how to article about seasoning. You always want to pat your steak dry before you add your seasoning. This helps keep the seasoning on the steak and not on the juices that could potentially come off the steak. When seasoning, I suggest [Kosher](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/YanZg23.jpg) salt and not table salt. <br><br>* Again, depending on the cut of meat will usually determine on how I cook it. If it is a filet I will usually pan sear it and finish it an oven until medium rare. A ribeye, I love grilled. Some people prefer there steaks black and blue. A popular cooking style is Philadelphia, which includes broiling the steak until it is charred on the top and bottom and rare on the inside. [Here]( https<colon>//www.theborgata.com/assets/dine/recipes/bobby_flay_signature_recipe.pdf) is a recipe by Bobby Flay that uses this method. I can not speak first hand about Sous Vide for steaks as I have never tried it. Cast iron pans are usually the best for pan searing a steak. If you want to impress your guests, work on getting those [perfect](http<colon>//i.imgur.com/oTje8Y8.png) grill marks. <br><br>* Pan sauces, are just that. They are made with the left over drippings from the meat, are often to have shallots, then are deglazed with some sort of wine or if you<sq>re like me, brandy. [This](http<colon>//www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/tip/how-to-make-a-pan-sauce.html) is a step by step guide by Williams Sonoma, who also offer cooking classes. <br><br>* This [article](http<colon>//www.seriouseats.com/2012/12/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-pan-seared-steaks.html) from serious eats is probably my favorite as it gives a good detail for a lot of what we are talking about. My personal favorite are dry aged steaks when done right. A place I used to work at we had a separate meat cooler just for dry aging steaks. We had a minimum of 14 days for dry aging and maximum of 21. They were melt in your mouth. Wet age is usually vacuuming sealing meat in a bag with some sort of marinade and letting it rest for a few weeks. Both types are delicious and both kinds have their draw backs. <br><br>Edit<colon> I have to head out to work, but if this gets some traction I may add to it when I get home. <br><br>Edit 2<colon> Thanks /u/notapantsday for the higher resolution chart. <br><br>Edit 3<colon> Thanks for all the feedback!

But even Lucky Charms and the Captain get boring after a while, so after a month or two I went on to discover new stuff again.

                "answer": "<p>Love the enthusiasm, but it will be difficult with zero first-hand experience to get a stage at a high-end restaurant, but not impossible. Good help is VERY hard to find.   Usually, from my experience as an intern, the stage is coming in and either just standing there the entire time, doing nothing, and not getting paid. Or, you<sq>re prepping.  And if you<sq>re prepping food, you<sq>ll need to know, at the very least, what is going on.  With that said, I<sq>ve also seen the Wine Buyers<sq> son get an internship at the same high-end restaurant, just because of who he was.  Completely clueless, and was more of a nuisance than anything. BUT, you could tell he really didn<sq>t want to be there, in the first place. <br> <br>So, there<sq>s a couple of choices you have.  If you want to stage, that<sq>s one thing but if you<sq>re looking for life advice, it<sq>ll be difficult to get a Chef to just sit with you.  However, you said your dad has worked in a lot of kitchens, so perhaps he knows some Chef<sq>s that would be willing to take the time to sit with you and talk.  He might also be the ticket to getting into a restaurant, but don<sq>t be surprised that if you wind up staging anywhere, you<sq>ll be doing the bitch work.  That includes everything, cleaning up after other Chefs, doing prep all day and during service, or even washing dishes to catch up.  <br><br>If you can find a Chef that is willing to let you into his kitchen, pay attention.  Chances are, he<sq>s patient and willing to teach.  Don<sq>t be annoying, watch more than talk, and only ask questions when the time is right, i.e not in the middle of service. <br><br>In a high-end restaurant, they<sq>re willing to teach you, but only to an extent.  They won<sq>t take the time to have you practice knife skills, and if you fuck up a batonet of carrot, you<sq>re gonna have a bad day.  There are plenty of Chefs, however, that have made successes of themselves with zero formal training, but it<sq>s a long road. <br><br>Culinary school can be expensive, but you<sq>ll get the same information at a community college school that you would at a place like the CIA.  There<sq>s definitely some differences, but you<sq>ll get the same basic knowledge that you would at either place. In my opinion, it<sq>s very helpful to have that background.  It<sq>ll open a lot more doors for you than having zero experience.  <br><br>My advice to a newbie... Be quiet. Listen and learn. Watch, don<sq>t talk too much.  Don<sq>t go in thinking your shit doesn<sq>t stink, even if you<sq>ve been to Culinary school. Get some good knives, like REALLY good knives and keep them sharp! In short, be humble.

People eat chicken all the time, and when they go out to a nice place they are often interested in trying something they can<sq>t get elsewhere. It may not deserve it, but it gets a bad rap because it<sq>s so prevalent.<br><br>2. You don<sq>t see things repeated often on high-end restaurant menus, so there aren<sq>t multiple different kinds of chicken. You<sq>ve got one chicken dish on the menu, which looks like an under-representation, but if you look at the rest of the menu there aren<sq>t usually more than one or two dishes of any other kind of protein either. It<sq>s not like there are 4 salmon dishes, and four lamb dishes or anything like that. So it<sq>s more of an equal, or just slightly lesser representation in many cases.<br><br>3. High quality chicken with a high quality preparation tends to cost more than people are used to paying for chicken. If I walk into a fine-dining restaurant and can pay $18 for chicken or $24 for lamb, and I have chicken most of the time for $6-$10, I<sq>m probably more likely to go for the lamb instead. <br><br>The shame is that a lot of fine dining restaurants do amazing things with chicken. The chicken we served was really pretty awesome - better than several other things on the menu, but most people skipped it over because of the reasons above. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>>yeast in oxygen environment, like this, won<sq>t create alcohol<br><br>That is true. Yeasts, like most organisms, have oxygen rich (aerobic) and oxygen poor (anaerobic) metabolic pathways. Aerobic metabolism is more efficient, and only has carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Anaerobic metabolism has carbon dioxide and ethanol as waste products. Essentially, oxygen lets the yeast extract a little more energy from the ethanol to take it all the way to water. Humans and more broadly, mammals (just in case you are a dog on the internet), use lactic acid fermentation during anaerobic metabolism. This is where you get the burn in your muscles during strenuous activity. Your muscles are temporarily deprived of oxygen, which leads to the production of lactic acid. Eventually, oxygen makes it to your muscles, which is used to clean up the lactic acid left behind. <br><br>Alcohol will never cook off entirely because water and ethanol create what<sq>s called an azeotrope. Essentially, water and alcohol form temporary interactions. You can break most of these interactions by applying heat which causes the alcohol to evaporate away. As you decrease the amount of alcohol in solution, more water molecules are able to interact with the same alcohol molecule. Eventually, the concentration of alcohol in the water will stay constant because the loss of alcohol due to evaporation is happening at the same rate and temperature as loss of water due to evaporation. </p>",

They<sq>re coming back, but most people still think of them as gross.<br><br>So, lets talk about em.<br><br>Oysters are a lot like wine. They have mystical properties, are tied with wealth, sex, etc. And more importantly, they have terroir, but from the water.<br><br>An oyster from the coast of France is going to taste different than an oyster from the coast of Japan, which will in turn be different form an oyster off the coast of Virginia.  This is sort of obviously due to the fact that oysters are filter feeders. They take on flavors of their surroundings, be it the mud they live in, the waters they siphon, or the things they eat (or things that get stuck inside).<br><br>Because of this, there<sq>s a great variation to oyster flavor profiles, similar to how a Pinot Noir from Burgundy will taste different than one from across the way in Germany, down the way in South Africa, or across the seas in Oregon or down to Mendoza. And as with wine, part of this comes from how it<sq>s cultivated, and part of it comes from it<sq>s place.<br><br>I<sq>m not terribly well versed in european oysters, so i<sq>ll talk mostly about oysters from North America.<br><br>We<sq>ll start on the west coast, in the PNW, where there are a large amount of recultured japanese species brought over from storms and boats and people and all kinds of things.  <br>The most popular, or at least most commonly known PNW/Japan hybrid you<sq>ll find anywhere, is the Kumamoto.  This is an incredible oyster for advanced eaters and newcomers alike.  <br><br>It<sq>s a small oyster, with an unrivaled aroma and finish that reminds many of honeydew melon.  With a mild brine, these are great for newcomers as they don<sq>t taste like muddy waters, and have a very recognizable flavor that will delight and enchant those who didn<sq>t think oysters could have flavors.<br><br>Swap Coasts and you can jump into Virginia, a hot bed for modern oyster farms and a variety that<sq>s impressive.  My personal favorite, the oyster that got me into oysters not too long ago, out of the Rappahanok river - the Sewansecott.  A medium/small oyster that<sq>s sort of slender with a pretty shell. This little guy hits all the things I think make eating oysters fun.  At first they<sq>re briney, like a slightly diluted gulp of sea water. Once you bite into them, they<sq>re incredibly creamy, but thanks to their size, it<sq>s not a bad thing (really big and creamy can be... gross imho).  Then the finish, crisp, clean, leaving you wanting more.  It<sq>s almost as if you didn<sq>t just eat a raw oyster.  There<sq>s a lot of other great oysters from this river/company, including Old Salts, Rappahanacks, and more.  They ship, give em a try.<br><br>Swing down the coast and around Florida and you<sq>re smack dab in old oyster country.  The Gulf. Once home to absurdly large Apalachacola oysters (still home) that more or less tasted like nothing, but were the size of your head - making them perfect for frying and putting on sandwiches. It<sq>s now a place that<sq>s catching up with the other coastal areas in oyster production.  Thanks to work with the schools nearby (Auburn for one), and modern techniques, they<sq>ve started producing high quality oysters that not only compete with east and west coast varieties in flavor, but also in price.  Which is something that nobody would have expected 10 years ago.  Murder Points are sort of my go to, since the name is fun, the oysters are solid - medium small to medium, briney, pretty little bites.  <br><br>Speaking of small briney pretty things, Prince Edwards Island is home to maybe the most popular fancy oyster in the east, the Beausoliel.  A teensy little package, beautifully cleaned and packed (you pay for that, these guys are pricey) in what you would imagine crates of oysters looked like 100 years ago. These guys... medium brine, super clean flavor, and they<sq>re the absolute perfect size for raw oysters. Just a few chews and they<sq>re gone.  You don<sq>t have to sit there chewing on the same oyster for 30 seconds slowly realizing that you<sq>re eating something that was alive about a minute ago, and you<sq>re basically eating it whole.  Delicious.<br><br><br>Some people view oysters like they view whisk(e)y, something to be enjoyed for what it is, not adultered with other flavors.  And while there is merit to that, not everybody wants to pound back 12 raw oysters with nothing else but a glass of dry riesling. The classic champagne vinegar mignonette is quite nice - finely diced shallots, thyme, maybe some pink peppercorns, and champagne vinegar.  Gives a great acidity to counter the salt, and really rounds out a good oyster.  Fresh Horseradish is next, spicy and delicious.  The texture of it I find can be a great addition to the cool soft goo of an oyster.  Fresh Lemons - a go to for most seafood, because of the bright acidity, it again helps just kind of slice through the saltyness and adds a nice bright flavor.  Then there<sq>s Cocktail Sauce (and crackers).  The Ranch dressing of the seafood world (or would that be tartar sauce?).  Personally, I feel like if you *need* cocktail sauce for your raw seafood, the seafood ain<sq>t worth your time.  I find it necessary when i<sq>m at the beach and go to a cheapy beer place that sells $5 dozens or similarly cheap priced, mediocre oysters.  <br><br>There<sq>s nothing wrong with adding a little extra flavor to your raw buddy, but as with whiskey, I always recommend eating one plain first, to experience the flavors of the beautiful creature, and then deciding where to go from there.<br><br>And then you get into cooking them.  Personally not a huge fan, but I<sq>ll eat em if you put em in front of me.  There<sq>s so many variations on smoked, grilled, baked, cheesed, bacon<sq>d, etc.  That it really shows off how versatile the oyster can be.  Generally, you<sq>ll use bigger, less awesome oysters for cooking, simply because 1<colon> the shell being larger means more toppings, and 2<colon> less spillage.  You wouldn<sq>t want to make a whiskey and coke with 23yr pappy, so equally you wouldn<sq>t want to do rockefeller with expensive high end oysters.<br><br><br>In the end, oysters can offer a wide range of tasting experiences, from the back of the boat shuck<sq>n with a screw driver drinking light beers on a hot day, to the chilled oyster on the half shell with a vinegar foam and a dollop of caviar.  I can<sq>t recommend them enough, and they<sq>re best enjoyed with good company, and an open mind.<br><br>And lastly, if you<sq>re new to oysters and want to try them, find an oyster bar. Don<sq>t buy a case and think you<sq>ll eat it all. Eat them a la carte, so you can eat them like a wine flight - tasting different oysters side by side, and getting the chance to explore what great things come from muddy waters.<br><br>GO FORTH, EAT OYSTERS, FILTER THE WATER!</p>",

Food Lab saves the day as usual<colon><br><br>>  I found that one packet of unflavored gelatin softened in 1/4 cup cold water, and then mixed into 1 quart of stock did a good job of enhancing body without pushing the stock into weirdly sticky, jellied territory.<br><br>Second<colon> when you are preparing the dish, you first make stock and heat it up. Many recipes have you start adding the other ingredients right away and zoom through the rest of the steps. If you want a thicker soup, this is the time you would let it simmer uncovered to reduce a bit. Once you add other ingredients, the clock starts ticking so you won<sq>t see it thicken much due to boiling off water after that point.<br><br>Third<colon> if you want to thicken at the end, you have many choices. I avoid cornstarch because it can make a shiny, gloopy sauce out of your soup too easily. We can go with another starch and add a roux but they will change the flavor or make it feel <dq>unauthentic<dq>.<br><br>One thing I<sq>ve been using a lot lately is coconut cream, which fits perfectly here! You can find cans of coconut cream at the asian grocer or online. If that fails and you can only find coconut milk (**not** light, full fat only), just keep the can in the fridge overnight and, when you open it, pull out the solid waxy plug from the top. That<sq>s coconut cream as well.<br><br>Make the soup as normal and cut way back on the coconut milk your recipe calls for (1/3 or 1/2 should do). Put the coconut cream in a big bowl and hit it with an electric mixer until soft peaks form (2-4 minutes on high for me). The soup should be off the heat and cooled slightly at this point. Fold the whipped coconut cream into the soup slowly, one spoonful at a time until you reach the desired thickness. It should keep its original flavor but have a thicker consistency and rich-as-heck mouthfeel.</p>",

Probably the most important thing is that the chef/sous chefs are pretty much always working on the busy days, which means there are more sets of eyes watching the quality of the food going out.

Salt <br><br>8. Pepper mill<br><br>9. Pecorino Romano cheese wedge <br><br>10. Parmesan cheese wedge<br><br>11. Asiago cheese wedge<br><br>12. (optional) Italian Seasoning<br><br>Start with a pot of water, add salt until it tastes like seawater. Roughly chop all the potatoes, add to the pot, and bring to a rolling boil. While that boils until easily pierced with a fork, cut the tips off 10 of the cloves of garlic, brush with olive or a neutral oil, and wrap tightly in foil. Place your foil wrapped garlic in a 400F oven and roast for 40-60 minutes, then remove and allow to cool. Once cooled unwrap the foil and the garlic should easily squeeze out of the cloves, remove the garlic and set aside. Take the pint of buttermilk and pour it in a saucepan with the butter and rosemary and simmer for at least 15 minutes before removing the rosemary. Once the potatoes are done, drain and coarsely mash them. Combine the roasted garlic, potatoes, and buttermilk mixture, then grate cheese in to taste and mash to the consistency you prefer (I like lumpy.) As a final step peel and puree the 2 raw heads of garlic in a food processor and add to taste with salt and pepper! This serves 20 potato lovers comfortably, and any leftovers freeze well and usually get made into shepherds pie later. </p>",

For example, cooking a small turkey will call for you to reduce cooking time if the recipe calls for a large one, since all you are trying to do is cook until just done. In a recipe like chili, the ingredients will be edible in a short amount of time, the simmering is more for flavor development, thickening, and texture. So in this case I wouldn<sq>t reduce the time by too much, maybe an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. Also, cooking time aside, IMO that recipe is pretty under spiced. I would kick up to cumin to about a tablespoon, double the cayenne, and add some fresh chilies like jalapeno. Also the recipe doesn<sq>t use a thickener, so you may want to add that, I recommend a ground masa slurry, or just finely crushed corn chips added near the beginning. Good luck!</p>",

Here<sq>s the first link I found that discusses this a bit<colon> [Chowhound<colon> Chili with masa flour?](http<colon>//chowhound.chow.com/topics/299838)<br><br>* Do you drain your beef once it<sq>s been cooked? Perhaps cooking it in a separate pan and then adding it would reduce the liquid in the final product, although this is speculation (don<sq>t cook meat) and the difference might be negligible.<br><br>* When you put your tomatoes in a food processor, are you producing a puree or just using your food processor to roughly dice them? In any case, I would imagine that dicing them by hand would lead to a less <dq>juicy<dq> end result. Perhaps you could leave them to drain in a colander while you prepare some other ingredients? However, tomatoes still release a lot of water when they<sq>re being cooked, which leads me to suggest...<br><br>* Perhaps trying your chili without tomatoes at all?

If they are simply canned red kidney beans, that bean sauce is only adding sodium and water. Consider using dried beans.<br><br>3. I suspect the tomatoes are a culprit here. Romas are a great variety for a thick sauce; you could make it thicker still by quartering them and squeezing out the juice and seeds. I most always use canned romas, which I will drain the water off of and then quickly pulse in a blender to rough chop them. The more you pulverize them, the less flesh/chunks and more juice you are left with. <br>4. Not sure why white wine, but to each their own. Personally, I would use beer. If you insist on using either, see my next point.<br>5. You need more cooking time. I like my chili super thick, so once my tomatoes and beer are in, I cook for around 3 hours. This also includes a small amount of tomato paste. If you only wish to use farmer<sq>s market tomatoes, you can either a)simmer a long time, or b)make a tomato paste yourself out of said tomatoes.

Just to highlight some of the better ones I<sq>ve seen mentioned here and throw in a few that are staples in my collection/that I loan out to new bakers.  <br>1. Momofuku Milk Bar by Christina Tosi. Excellent foreword IMO, on what it takes to love pastry and do it as a job, as well as good, modern recipes. Downside is you might have to be patient in sourcing some harder to find ingredients.   <br>2. Bouchon Bakery by Thomas Keller. Nice rundown of more classic French pastry as well as an easy to follow section on bread.   <br>3. Ratio by Michael Ruhlman. Solid recipes, also gives a good amount of the theory behind a lot of stuff.  <br>4. Tartine Bakery by Pruiett and Robertson. Actually my favorite bakery in the world. This is an instant classic and a staple of any serious baker<sq>s collection. A little more advanced technique wise, but their products are on a whole other level.  <br>5. Cooked by Michael Pollan. Not so much a baking book, or even cookbook for that matter, but the section on bread baking is a great meditation on what bread means to us as a human species. I recommend everyone read this, or at least watch the netflix version, before baking bread. It brings down the anxiety of learning bread, and makes you feel more connected to what is a very organic process.   <br>6. Ad Hoc at Home by Thomas Keller. Again, a pretty standard cookbook, but the baking section has some stellar, simple recipes that I use when I need to bang something out at home.  <br>7. Josey Baker Bread by Josey Baker. Guy<sq>s damned near a bread savant if I<sq>ve ever be so bold as to use the term. Book takes you from basics and works to complexity from there.  <br>8. The Professional Pastry Chef<colon> Fundamentals of Baking and Pastry, 4th Edition by Bo Friberg. This is a baking book yes, but it is also a textbook. Do not try to absorb all of the information in its 1000+ pages at once. This is a primer for new techniques that you stumble across in the above books, or a place to check as a reference when you can<sq>t seem to master a technique or something isn<sq>t coming out right. The rule of thumb I was taught with this book is that there is generally a better way to do everything in here, but the better way is small details that cannot be taught, they have to be learned through practice. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Hey, mechanical engineering student here with a focus in manufacturing processes. What<sq>s happening is that when metal is deformed (like when a flat sheet of metal is punched and pressed into shape) in the manufacturing process, it stretches and compresses in different areas which creates a lot of internal stresses. Sort of like stretching rubber or compressing a sponge, except that the forces holding the metal together are also keeping the metal in a continuous state of tension and compression. When you change the temperature so much it changes the balance of forces, it pushes and pulls the metal all over the place. It<sq>s like how wood changes shape when it gets to dry, wet, hot or cold and makes your house groan and creek in the winter.<br><br>This can easily be fixed by either designing the shaping process properly, or annealing the metal. Annealing means heating up metal to the point where the stresses <sq>relax<sq>, and is a very common practice. Or in other words, whoever had those products made deliberately chose to skip steps that they knew would create a defective product to save themselves some money. Not you though. You got scammed.<br><br>I<sq>m not familiar with the market and marketing for oven sheet pans so I have no idea how descriptive they<sq>ll be, but it says that they are *annealed, tempered, or heat treated*, you stand a much better chance of getting something that<sq>s made properly.

Lots and lots of bread recipes are exactly the same<colon> 3 cups of flour, packet of yeast, yada yada, allow to double in size, punch down, bake. The results are serviceable but mediocre. <br><br>To me, the most important factor in bread making is *time*. Yeast takes time to develop complex, interesting flavors. The trick is to slow down your rise, giving the yeast the time it needs but not letting it over-proof and get boozy. Couple of ways to do this<colon> you can cut way down on the amount of yeast (keep a jar of yeast in the freezer and use as needed so you don<sq>t have to deal with packets), you can just toss your regular recipe in the fridge for a while, or you can use a <dq>[pre-ferment](https<colon>//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-ferment)<dq> in which you let yeast really go to town on a small amount of flour and water before incorporating the mixture into your final dough.<br><br>Another thing that can lead to more interesting bread is to use more water than usual. A typical recipe might use 55 or 60 grams of water for every 100 grams of flour. This will give you bread with a tight <dq>crumb,<dq> with lots of tiny, uniform bubbles. Increase that to 70 or even 80 grams and you<sq>ll get a much gnarlier loaf with big, uneven bubbles. That<sq>s not always what you want, but it can be a nice way to add interest.<br><br>Finally, be sure to not underbake your bread. Unless you<sq>re making sandwich bread, you want a nice rich brown crust for the best flavor. Overbaking is pretty tough to do, so just keep an eye on it and let it stay in the oven until it<sq>s good and roasty.<br><br>Now, there<sq>s lots more to baking great bread, but hopefully that<sq>ll get you headed in the right direction. Incidentally, it also just so happens that there<sq>s a very famous [recipe](http<colon>//cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread) from a guy named Jim Lahey in New York which puts all of the above principles (and more) into practice. It<sq>s really the only bread I cook nowadays, because it<sq>s unbelievably easy and makes better bread than all but the best bakery in town. As a bonus, there<sq>s no kneading\u2014gluten forms though autolysis over the long, 18-24 hour rise time, aided by the high hydration (80 grams of water per 100 grams of flour). The bread is cooked in a Dutch oven, providing a heat reserve to promote <dq>oven spring<dq> (where the yeast<sq>s activity speeds up before it succumbs to the heat) and containing moisture to slow the forming of a crust that would prevent expansion. If you don<sq>t have a Dutch oven, you can cook it on a baking stone or sheet pan and just spritz some water in the oven a few times during the first ten minutes of cooking. It<sq>ll make more of a ciabatta-type thing in that case.<br><br>One last thing<colon> be sure to get a digital scale and measure your ingredients by weight. Makes scaling and consistency easier, although you might not care about that if you want to avoid uniformity! The linked recipe above gives volume measurements, but you<sq>ll want to use 430 grams flour, 345 grams water, 8 grams salt, and 1 gram yeast (a little less if you want to push the rise to 20-24 hours, a little more if you<sq>re in a hurry and only have like 6 or so hours). <br><br>Wow, that<sq>s a lot of text.

I<sq>ll try to make this easier to read.<br><br>1. If you just turn on the stove and smell gas for a few seconds afterwards, it<sq>s fine. It<sq>s just a little bit that escaped that didn<sq>t get lit. Only worry about gas smell if all your burners are off, or if you<sq>ve been cooking for a while and haven<sq>t turned a burner on in a while.<br><br>2. /u/mrsnerdy talked about flames getting smaller as you use other burners.  This may be true for their specific burner, but it<sq>s not the norm. I<sq>ve personally never seen this happen. So unless you notice one burner<sq>s flame getting smaller as you raise the flame on another, do not expect it or cook with that expectation.<br><br>4. Also as mrsnerdy said, gas heat is instant. Only put something on the heat you intend to start cooking then and there.<br><br>3. The flame from the gas will not cause burn marks on the bottom on your pan. The gas burns cleanly and you won<sq>t need to clean the bottom of your pans. The only way this will happen is if you get food or oil on the pan bottom, and then apply flame to it.<br><br>4. Adjusting the heat is precise. Don<sq>t think on terms of Low, Medium, High. You can adjust the flame, and therefore the heat, precisely by very delicately adjusting the knob. After you cook for a bit you<sq>ll slowly gain an innate knowledge of how hot your pan will be when you turn the knob a certain way.<br><br>5. Turning off the flame before adding alcohol is smart.<br><br>6. Being careful not to leave paper or cutlery too close to the burners is smart.<br><br>7. There<sq>s a reason professional chefs use gas. It<sq>s just better than electric. After using yours for a while you<sq>ll be able to know exactly how long and how high heat to use to do everything from simmer sauce, boiling water, searing a steak, cooking salmon, steaming veggies, etc. With a few good pans and a gas stove you can cook literally anything. <br><br>8.

Something like a homemade mac<sq>n<sq>cheese is fantastic, it shows how much better homemade is compared to the box stuff. <br><br>2) A red sauce - this is the base of a huge number of recipes and skills can be crossed over to a bunch of other recipes. An example of this could be a simple marinara for spag bol, or something similar. <br><br>3) A stir-fry - this teaches knife skills and cooking times of different veggies. If you want to crumb/batter the meat in the stir fry, or even just coat the pieces in corn starch then it bumps it up to a professional level. <br><br>4) A curry - making a curry paste from scratch that can be chucked in the fridge and used later if it<sq>s not all used at once. This can be more of a slow cooked recipe but has super valuble skills, as well as being delicious and flavourful.<br><br>5) A soup - making a stock from scratch and then making basically any soup will set you up really well for understanding depth of flavour and how to combine different flavours. <br><br>6) A roast - super simple but making a roast with lots of veggies and a few sides is really helpful in showing how simply seasoning food well and roasting it makes such a delicious meal. Also making a gravy from the pan drippings is a great skill to have. <br><br>In 6 meals you can teach someone to be an expert cook, it<sq>s not hard even if it sounds like you<sq>re throwing them in the deep end.

OR use your broiler.<br><br>Whatever your weapon of choice is, without a commercial kitchen at your disposal you<sq>ll make your life much easier if you find a method that completes the last step of steak-cooking for all the steaks at the same time. You can adjust doneness by giving them different amounts of time in the heat, but you don<sq>t want to be juggling them in pans on a residential range.<br><br>I<sq>ve done sous vide, reverse sear, blowtorch, cast iron, lots of pans at once, giant griddle, you name it, I<sq>ve tried to serve steaks to 8 people in my house that way. Here are some things to consider<colon><br><br>* Mass searing even 4 steaks is not going to work well if your pan only fits 2. Frankly, you<sq>re not even getting an ideal sear if the pan barely fits two, the steam is going to get trapped and you<sq>ll steam the steaks before they sear, and you<sq>ll get too much gradient inside the steak. With only 4, you might be able to get away with searing off with multiple pans, but it<sq>s a pain in the ass and most homes don<sq>t have the ventilation to deal with it.<br>* Reverse sear and sous vide are very attractive for restaurants for this, but again they have the range and the ventilation to deal with that much searing, and both of these methods require you to sear at the end so you<sq>re going to be crunching to do it for all the steaks at the last second.<br>* If you sear the steaks first, you can do one at a time and as long as you finish the steaks with dry heat (oven, broiler) the crust will be fine. If you sear and then move to the fridge or to sous vide, that crust is going to be ruined and soggy.<br>* If you<sq>re only used to cooking for 1-2 people, you<sq>re going to struggle to entertain guests while doubling that number and trying to put meals on the plate at the same time. If you<sq>re finishing in the oven, the last several-minutes of cooking is no more work than cooking for 1 and it gives you time to plate and get ready.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>When in doubt, ask Kenji<colon><br><br>> Truth of the matter is that you should salt your meat about 40 minutes before it hits the grill. When the salt first hits a steak, it sits on the surface. Through the process of osmosis, it<sq>ll slowly draw liquid out of the meat, which you<sq>ll see pool up in little droplets. As those droplets grow, the salt will dissolve in the meat juice, forming a concentrated brine. At this stage in the game\u2014about 25 to 30 minutes in\u2014your steak is in the absolute worst shape possible for grilling. That moisture will evaporate right off, leaving you with a tough, stringy crust. Give it a bit more time, and eventually that brine will begin to break down some of the muscle tissue in the meat, allowing the juices to be re-absorbed, and taking the salt right along with it. What does this lead to? Meat that is both better seasoned and more tender and moist when you cook it. All that said, you will not be destroying anything delicious if you choose to salt your meat straight out of the fridge and into the pan. Personally I season my steaks at least a few days in advance, to give the salt maximum time to work its way into the meat. Why steakhouses don<sq>t do this is a mystery to me. And remember<colon> USE KOSHER SALT, not regular table salt. The larger grains of kosher salt (which should more accurately be called <dq>koshering salt,<dq> as salt itself is always kosher\u2014kosher salt is coarse salt used in the koshering process) are easier to sprinkle evenly with your fingers, and will also draw more initial moisture out of the meat to dissolve than table salt.<br><br>[Source, also more info and an awesome read.](http<colon>//www.seriouseats.com/2012/12/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-pan-seared-steaks.html)<br><br>Tl;dr ideally salt 40 minutes or more (even up to a few days) before grilling, with kosher salt.

The Food Standards Agency have a big campaign each year warning people about the dangers of food poisoning from barbecues which results in people over cooking the food to the point of being inedible. Given the preference for cooking over manly looking roaring flames rather than actually serviceable embers it is very common for sausages in particular to be heavily burned and I<sq>ve eaten some before that genuinely resembled the charcoal they were cooked on both in terms of appearance and texture.

Typical thing you would find on the grill is pork and chicken,  side salad with potato and a kinda French loaf with herbed butter.  Beef is not really great here unless you know a specialised butcher or order it online,  which to be honest is very easy to do. The cuts are very different though - the mains are entrecote & filet medallions. Typical steak size is 300grams being considered large.  You hardly see a tbone,  rib in,  full filet or rump and ribs are hard to come by. It is pretty difficult to grill out of season as the stores mostly completely stop selling related items. </p>",

                "answer": "<p>Getting the proportions of ice cream to milk right is the most critical part to having a consistent thick shakes IMO. Use a good dense ice cream (not a light whipped one with lots of air) and use a good WHOLE MILK for thick creamy shakes.  But getting the ratio in the cup right is critical. It is less milk than you think you may need--usually less than 1/3rd milk in the cup bottom. So you will need to experiment with the cup size you have to get the right amount of milk to ice cream ratios. Today I see  folks use a small scale.. The BEST shakes I get and make come in two cups--the milkshake I want and a small <dq>shot glass<dq> taster of shake that was left over in the metal mixing cup that seems to never make it to the final serving cup due to size-so the point here is to make sure your serving cups can hold whole the ratio cause sometimes the best part is what is left in the mixer cup.. Also--you will want some [LONG SPOONS](http<colon>//www.amazon.com/WMF-Manaos-Bistro-Iced-Spoon/dp/B001ECQQZQ/ref=pd_sim_79_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=0A9RBC8RPH9WJY6BEZ70) like bartender or mixer spoons to give a small stir on the sides while it mixes--and also know it takes a bit of mixing time (1-2 minutes) to make a good shake in the spindle mixers.  Lastly--get a good quality straw to serve with the shake--cheap plastic ones are so so--you want a straw that has a good diameter to allow milkshake liquid and ice cream to be sucked up but not so thin that clogs or it is a huge task.   <br> TIP---make sure your mixer cups are metal--they keep things cold and are easy to quickly clean IMO..and have several (cause as you make you will need to rinse and re-use again in service often and you may have several going at the same time...The link you provided is the right style--but shop around...they do come in pairs or triples--meaning you can get 2-3 shakes going at the same time etc. And if one goes down--you are not screwed til you get a replacement. Also - always have a mixer cup of hot water to clean the spindle after each use too. Have several mixers and metal mixer cups..   <br><br>As for the shake--get a good WHOLE MILK and a dense ice cream as mentioned--but You can so some enhancements if you wish--whipped cream on top, cherry<sq>s etc...but there are cookie or candy toppings etc--up to you.. For flavors--a dash of vanilla or some fresh vanilla bean into a shake is always nice. For chocolate--a squirt of chocolate syrup is good if it is needed or a tiny pinch of kosher salt in the chocolate before blanding can help to enhance the flavor...but whatever you do make sure you mix well to incorporate. There is a technique to using the spindle mixers to get a well blended shake--you don<sq>t want pockets of milk or cream or whatever unblended or trailing into the top of the shake cause it sat at the bottom. It should always go MILK, ICE CREAM and then any additions--then BLEND. Some make the mistake for example by putting chocolate syrup first so it sits at the bottom and this is wrong.    <br><br><br>My two cents--hope this helps (FWIW--worked in a soda-jerk type old fashioned ice cream shop for years when I was in high school long ago--I know my shakes!)<br><br>EDIT<colon> fixed link</p>",

                "answer": "<p>This question is incredibly broad.<br><br>It is best to answer this by treating wine as any other cooking liquid like stock, with the addition of alcohol of course.<br><br>As you cook any liquid composed mostly of water, the water evaporates, leaving everything else(sugars, proteins, flavor molecules, fat) left in. As more and more water evaporates, all the other molecules in the food become more concentrated. Of course, some of the food molecules in the liquid to evaporate as well(this is why we smell what we are cooking), just not as easily as water. At the same time, the heat is breaking down and in some cases creating new food molecules, changes the flavor of the sauce.<br><br>In addition to the liquid evaporating and concentrated, you have liquid from, in your case the beef, being pushed out of the meat and into the sauce. A small amount of liquid also enters the meat, but that liquid is minimal to the amount being lost, at during cooking. When cooling down the meat in the sauce, a significant amount of liquid from the sauce is absorbed by the meat, but this is slightly off topic.<br><br>Back on topic, the alcohol in the wine, actually evaporates easier than water. This means that, with enough simmering, almost no alcohol will exist in the sauce near the end of cooking. Keep in mind, it would take multiple hours to completely evaporate all the alcohol out. A large amount of alcohol is not a good thing in a sauce. In fact, any more than 1<percent> or so can actually not only lend its harsh flavor and sensations to the sauce, it can also inhibit aroma. And remember, aroma=flavor in the mouth, so we really want to get the alcohol content as low as we can, ideally around 1<percent>. At these concentrations, alcohol can increase the aroma from the food, leading to a more flavorful sauce.<br><br>In conclusion, wine is great to use for cooking. It has a nice fruity flavor and acidity that is great for a wide variety of dishes. The alcohol has its drawbacks, but used well, it can even improve your food.</p>",

Heating this liquid encourages those compounds to become airborne and the longer or hotter you heat it the more of these molecules will leave, leaving behind some of the molecules that are more stable in aqueous solution at higher temperatures. <br><br>Thats the physical reaction going on but in addition to that, heat and high acidity tend to get things moving chemically so there is bound to be some changes there as well.

There shouldn<sq>t be any issues washing your pot with soap, I do this for my coffee pot. It is inevitable that some soap will stick to the glass, but rinsing it with water will remove all but the initial layer on the pot (theoretically). Now this begs the question, do we care about these <sq>stubborn<sq> left over soap molecules? Some of these stubborn molecules can also be released with heat, so rinsing with hot water is vital to remove soap. However, these pots will hold liquids that are likely hotter than the water with which you are rinsing your pots. So if you want to be thorough, you should rinse the inside of your pots with boiling water, as this is the max temperature which your pot will encounter during use. If any soap molecules are stuck beyond this point, they won<sq>t be coming off during your coffee/tea time.<br><br>This might be a very unsatisfying final answer, but IMO, the difference in removing soap molecules between rinsing your pot with warm water from the tap or washing in a dishwasher and rinsing with boiling water is small. If any soap leaches out from the surface of the pot into your coffee will mainly be in the initial coffee you make after washing. So as a final thought and you<sq>re still unsure if you should use soap, brew a full pot of just water and it<sq>ll ensure any soap contamination afterwards is minimized.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>In my experience (home cook), sweating onions means just cooking them until they are translucent but not really golden. Browned onions still retain their structure yet are soft (and are obviously golden-brown in color), while caramelized onions are more of a brown onion mess, at least in the way that I do mine. Sweating takes around 5 minutes, browning probably takes about 10 minutes (depending on the amount of onion in the pan) and caramelizing takes a heck of a lot longer. <br><br>The point of browning is just to get more pronounced onion flavour out of the ingredient. You can get more of the flavour if you deglaze the pan with a bit of liquid, which picks up the onion-flavoured brown bits in the pan (known as fond) and then add it to whatever you are making. You can also put a bit of salt and sugar on the onions while they are sweating on medium heat to speed up the process, though not by much. <br><br>Whether you sweat, saute, brown or caramelize is dependent on what you want out of the onions in terms of flavour and texture. Stirfrys treat onions as just another base ingredient so giving them a light frying with with all other veggies in the pan (such as carrots, peppers, broccoli, etc) is just fine, as you are looking for a tiny bit of crunch. Browning is just pushing that further so you get nicer color, tiny bit softer texture and more pronounced flavour. French and Polish cooking comes to mind when I think of browned onions. <br><br>Caramelizing onions is extracting the maximum amount of flavour out of them so they are used as a key part of the dish. As you mentioned, it can be used as burger toppings, or especially if you want to make French onion soup. Caramelized onions are great for savoury tarts too, since they turn very sweet and mild with this process.<br><br>Don<sq>t take my word for this as I am just a humble home cook who loves doing it, so this is just my understanding. The pros probably can give a better explanation. </p>",

I don<sq>t categorize that alongside caramelizing. Caramelizing is more like sweating for a very long time and results in soft onions.

In a small sauce pan, bring the 4oz of cream to a simmer (190 degrees F).  Temper the egg yolks by whisking the hot cream into the yolks at a slow drizzle.**<br><br>>Place chocolate **and egg/cream mixture** in the heat proof bowl set over a bain marie or in a double boiler at a low simmer.  Stir until chocolate melts and the mixture is uniform and smooth and slightly thickens. Turn off the heat and let stand **(and, if using, mix in the framboise.)**<br><br>>Beat the **rest of the** cream over ice (or in a chilled bowl) until it forms soft peaks. Set aside and hold at room temperature. With a mixer, whip egg to soft peaks. <br><br>>Remove the chocolate mixture from the bain marie and using a whisk, fold in the egg whites all at once. When the whites are almost completely incorporated, fold in the whipped cream. Cover the mousse and refrigerate for approximately 1 hour or until set.

On an older America<sq>s Test Kitchen podcast, they talked to a guy who recreated a medieval kitchen and he discovered that the because of the way the fire and chimney worked, there was a near constant cold air draft blowing across the roast opposite the side exposed to the fire. This temperature differential would be many hundreds of degrees, maybe even a thousand. I suspect that the rapid heating and cooling of the meat proteins would encourage tenderization. I don<sq>t think calpains are being activated as sous vide wet aging doesn<sq>t appear to show a significant difference. Additionally, looking at activity and temperature curves for calpains, you only get a linear relationship between temperature and activity. This suggests that you only would cut tenderization time in half, and given that 14 days is really the minimum to get appreciable effects in aging, you would need to cook your roast for 7 days to notice the effects.    <br><br>As others have said, lots of people are now realizing that flipping more is better for a more evenly cooked meat. This is scaling up that approach for larger cuts, and is actually a very old technique. </p>",

With no fat, like other steaks you would cook rare (like sirloin), it is more finicky on the grill. And any variations in size or thickness will affect the cooking time, so multiple cuts from the same tenderloin, all equal thickness, will cook at different times. And you<sq>re not cooking with a probe thermometer in a restaurant, so you do it all by feel.<br><br>Secondly, the simplicity. One of the hardest things to cook is a classic plain omelette. The devil is in the details, and they are much easier to see when the dish is so simple. How much did you beat the eggs? What dairy was added? How much butter in the pan? Did you leave a soft curd? Did you properly avoid any color on the egg?<br><br>You can think about filet the same way. How perfect is your crust on the sear? How perfect is your seasoning? What percentage of the steak is perfectly rare? There is nothing else to judge on, so those become even more important. You<sq>re not going to spice it, and, for the most part, pan sauce is just the jus.<br><br>Thirdly, where did you get your steak? Since it is all about steak essence, this is where things like grass fed, grass finished, never feedlot become really important. Because you can taste it most obviously here.</p>",

Serious eats did a taste test on various iced coffee methods, including the two you [mentioned](http<colon>//www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/whats-the-best-way-to-brew-iced-coffee.html). If you like milk in your iced coffee, you should cold brew, if you like black iced coffee, you should use the japanese method. Cold brewing is not going to extract all the compounds that hot brewing can. The limit of hot brewing is that you need a good way to cool down the coffee quickly. When I want iced coffee, I will make a siphon pot batch, transfer the hot coffee into a jar, and then put the jar into my circulating water bath. Once the coffee is equilibrated with the bath, I will store in the fridge, or pour out a cup over ice. I prefer chilled siphon over other methods because it extracts more oils, and they don<sq>t get filtered out like they would with a pour over. Additionally, my siphon filter does an excellent job at keeping sludge out of the cup, so I don<sq>t have to worry about continuing extraction while it sits. Lastly, I think siphon is unique in its ability to maintain an excellent flavor even when served chilled, but that could be bias on my part.  <br><br>Also /r/coffee has a well informed community that may be better able to assist you.</p>",

It<sq>s usually split in two pieces, each about the size of a grape. Then you get the liver, which is large and squishy and purple-ish. All three can be used when making a stock or broth, just tossed in with the bones. This is really the only use for the neck, as well. There isn<sq>t any edible meat, but there<sq>s tons of flavor and gelatin between all those bones. The hearts can be used for a few things like frying or saut\u00e9ing and served alone or with various tart or sweet sauces. But hearts are really an acquired taste. <br><br>That leaves the liver. The real gem. These are the same livers as Foie Gras, sort of. Just not fattened up. But the flavor is very similar. So it can be used for a lot of different preparations.

Generally any un-flavored liquor will behave the same, it<sq>ll just bring it<sq>s distinctive flavor with it. Avoid things with artificial flavoring, they don<sq>t mesh predictably with natural flavors. If you<sq>re tempted to put strawberries in banana vodka, do a little as an experiment first. If it<sq>s naturally flavored or infused it should be closer to what you<sq>d expect. <br><br>Longer soak times create higher potency, and more porous fruits get a more consistent soak and saturate faster. For example, pineapples are great at soaking quickly and evenly, but apples take awhile to soak through. If you<sq>re short on time with a harder fruit, you can always slice thinner pieces. <br><br>I<sq>ve never waiting long enough to spoil any of them ;)<br><br>As long as the fruit maintains the consistency you need, you can generally use it however you want, but like /u/admu7373 said, you could be adding a lot more liquid to the recipe so make sure to compensate for that. I<sq>ve never used the fruit as the main ingredient, more like a garnish/extra kick type thing. If you do an apple pie, you should be fine adding some infused slices on top for kick, but if your whole pie is made of that stuff, it<sq>ll probably be too strong. As far as potency, each fruit has a certain limit as to how much liquid it can hold, and it<sq>ll never be more potent than what you<sq>re soaking it in, so you should be hitting 90<percent> of that pretty quickly depending on the fruit.<br><br>I can<sq>t really think of anything super original, though I did have a sampler platter once at a friends for dessert.</p>",
