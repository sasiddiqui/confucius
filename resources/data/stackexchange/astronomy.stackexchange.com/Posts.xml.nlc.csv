A central object is a star (pre-MS, WD or NS, but not a BH) of mass $M$, surrounded by a thin flat disc of material, which continuosly feeds the star at a rate $\dot{M}$, such that $M/\dot{M}$ is much larger than thermal and dynamical timescale of the star (i.e. accretion rate is slow).</p><br><br><p>Everywhere in the accretion disc its local motion is nearly circular and nearly Keplerian. Therefore, at the interface of the star and the disc the disc will always tend to make the star rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities. From the other hand, if the stellar outer parts were to rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities, these parts would become gravitationaly detached from the star, which would have significant consequences for the stellar shape and structure. Surely, though, the process is going to be slow and the acquired angular momentum will be redistributed within the star.</p><br><br><p>Now the question: <strong>What will be happening to the star if it approaches nearly break-up velocities due to such a spin-up?</strong> This involves a few subquestions: How close the rotation rate can actually get to the critical one? If it can get close enough, how would the whole process look like? That is, what would happen in the short term to the star when the effects of rotation will start to affect its structure? What would happen to the star in the long term?</p><br><br><p>I would like to keep this problem as a purely hydrodynamical one. That is, assume, that the only laws involved are hydrodynamical and gravitational ones, with some constant accretion rate supported. In reality magnetic fields would also play an important role for some stars, and stellar winds could also possibly be important.</p><br><br><p>Examples of the decribed systems are numerous. It might concern cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, pre-main sequence star in a protoplanetary disc, and many more.</p><br>""",ai

The focus begins 550 AU away, but maybe a 700 or 1000 AU distance is needed to get rid of disturbances from the Corona, and the focus extends practically indefinately. Here are some slides by Dr. Maccone who has promoted this idea he calls FOCAL:<br><a href=""http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf</a></p><br><br><p>I intend to ask about the technical design and feasibility of such a project in the Space Exploration SE.

As if it were an animation, the star isn't just a white blob, it looks like the sun, where the blob is moving - as if it were a liquid. No I am not stupid enough to point the scope at the sun... during night time. The stars just move like a liquid in the center, is this an effect of the mirror? I can't see why it would be as the image was fine during daylight. Is this how all stars work? I haven't had a chance to point it at the moon or any other planets so I can't test it on an object that isn't a star.</p><br><br><p>Also, as the scope is a reflector it has the ""three lines"" on the front, however this interferes with the object I am looking at as i can see the lines on the star.

"""<p>If we were to put a highly reflective substance into Venus's upper atmosphere, could we cool it down?  I am envisioning adding a highly reflective fine dust or gas, possibly lighter than ""air"" to the atmosphere.  I believe to have the proper effect, it should also reflect infrared light, which causes heat.  Apparently Venus already has a high albedo of .75 (reflects 75% of light): <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/36833/albedo-of-venus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.universetoday.com/36833/albedo-of-venus/</a> .

What happened before the big bang according to these scientists?

How on earth can it be a blast , because obv like any blast it should decreases and come to a hault , here instead of the universe expansion decelerating its actually accelerating.

I assume that the orbits had to be modified in advance of the comet's arrival. I picture some orbital modifications that changed the phase of the orbits of the satellites so that they would be on the other side of Mars as the dust flew by, perhaps also making the orbits more elliptical with the apsis behind Mars, allowing the satellites to spend additional time in Mars' protection.</p><br><br><p>Will these orbital modifications affect the ability of the spacecraft to fulfil their primary missions as they relate to Mars?  I am not asking whether dust from the comet will affect the quality of the instruments on the spacecraft (indeed, this whole question focuses on steps NASA is taking to prevent that from happening) but whether the altered orbits the spacecraft have after their orbital modifications will affect their ability to pursue their primary missions (such as flying over different parts of Mars than was originally intended, which may or may not be beneficial to answering the questions the spacecraft were originally launched to answer.  Although scientists are nothing if not resourceful and I'm sure any data that come from the spacecraft, whether intended or not, will lead to important discoveries).</p><br>""",ai

In a Newtonian central-force elliptical-orbit model the addition of an extra centre-directed acceleration ($dV/dt$), which varies through the orbit as $(+3 V_t^2/c^2\,\equiv \, +3 h^2/r^2c^2)$ times the co-temporal standard Newtonian centre-directed gravitational acceleration, can be shown (by first order perturbation analysis or numerical modelling) to produce apsidal precession at a rate (radians per orbit) defined by a Newtonian formula $$\epsilon = 24 \pi^3 \frac{a^2}{T^2 c^2(1-e^2)}$$ .  This formula is well-known (see for example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia Apsidal precession</a>). According to, but not clearly referenced by, <a href=""http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath527/kmath527.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>, the formula (or an algebraic equivalent using other terms) was well known c. 1895 (i.e. <em>before</em> the publications of Gerber 1898 and Einstein 1915).

In a Kepler/Newton system the tangential or transverse velocity of a low-mass orbitting object depends on the radial distance of the high-mass object from the centre.

My question here is that, given real-life observational constraints (like sunlight) how far from the Sun would an object have to be to never be seen in prograde motion?

As the stars appear to revolve around the earth, they make ""arcs"" on the film.</p><br>  <br>  <p>To calculate the angle of the arc, use the formula: 1 minute of time = 15 minutes of arc. If the answer is over 60, divide by 60 to get degrees of arc. So: 12 minute exposure = 180 minutes of arc or 3Ë of arc length for your star trail. </p><br></blockquote><br><br><p>I'm not sure how to approach this problem since the answer uses time to calculate the angle of the arc, but no time is given here.</p><br>""",ai

These are claims I find impossible to believe.  </p><br><br><p>A simple application of, for instance, the Raleigh Criterion ($\theta = 1.22~\lambda/D$), where $\theta$ is the angular resolution of the telescope, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light in question, and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope, would show that a comparison between angular resolutions is as simple as comparing the diameters of the telescope apertures.  Hubble's mirror is 2.4 m; comparing with the 24.5 m GMT and the 30 m TMT we see that the GMT will have 10.2 times the angular resolution of Hubble, while the TMT will have 12.5 times the angular resolution of Hubble.  I think a calculation similar to the one I have described is how the article linked above came up with the numbers they did about the angular resolution of these telescopes compared to Hubble. </p><br><br><p>However, the Raleigh criterion only applies to telescopes working at their diffraction limit.  Space telescopes (if they're designed well and built correctly) can work close to the diffraction limit (maybe even at the diffraction limit).

Thus the GMT and TMT by themselves will <strong>not</strong> have better image resolution than Hubble.</p><br><br><p><strong>My question, then, is whether this article is correct (possibly because of one of the reasons I list below) or whether it seems this article naively applied the Raleigh Criterion for angular resolution with no thought about how the atmosphere will affect the resolving capabilities of these large ground-based telescopes.</strong></p><br><br><p>Possible reasons the article may still be correct:</p><br><br><ul><br><li>Adaptive optics, a developing technology which can allow telescopes to correct for distortions to the image produced by the atmosphere.

Media coverage of the departure of Voyager 1 from our solar system into the realm of interstellar space alerted me to the idea that there is an outer edge to solar influence, and I would guess that this is where the lighter molecules, like water and gases would tend to land.

Our clouds form at the altitude where water tends to deposit after it evaporates from the heated surface of the Earth. It gathers there and coalesces to a form which is then overcome by the opposing force of gravity. Then it returns from whence it came. Similarly, I imagine water and gases ultimately being driven from the heat of the sun to an âaltitude above its surfaceâ, where ultimately, over a much longer time scale, that material coalesces until other forces eventually drive them back toward the hot sun.

But how do we convert those waves to visible light so we can actually see them.  I don't know if I'm staying this right but another example that just came to me is pictures of the Sun we see that was taken with radio waves, we see them,  which must mean that they were covered into visible light some how, so I was just wondering how, thanks in return =)</p><br>""",ai

Of course, that result was so preposterous that it was summarily dismissed.  However, when I read that article, I thought it made sense.  Surely the universe is much more massive than its contents, so as General Relatively predicts, should experience time more slowly.  This conclusion seemed so obvious that a) a bunch of other folks much brighter than I would have thought of it, and b) therefore my conclusion is completely erroneous.
