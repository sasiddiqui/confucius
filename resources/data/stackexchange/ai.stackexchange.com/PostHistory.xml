Once we are able to build an AI AI researcher (that is, a computer that knows how to make computers better at thinking), the economic and military relevance of humans will rapidly disappear as any decision that could be made by a human could be made better by a computer.

So, to help in furthering AI, I want to better understand the current obstacles that are hindering our progress in this field.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, time and space complexity of some machine learning algorithms is super-polynomial which means that even with fast computers, it can take a while for the program to complete. Even still, some algorithms may be fast on a desktop or other computer while dealing with a small data set, but when increasing the size of the data, the algorithm becomes intractable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What are other issues currently facing AI development?" />

And this formula the second machine will not be able to produce as being true, while a mind will be able to see that it is true. And if now a third machine is constructed, able to do what the second machine was unable to do, exactly the same will happen: there will be yet a third formula, the Gödelian formula for the formal system corresponding to the third machine's scheme of operations, which the third machine is unable to produce as being true, while a mind will still be able to see that it is true. And so it will go on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, by making the system more complex, it can see the inadequacy of a less complex system, but a yet more complex system can see its inadequacy.

However, there's indeed a bias towards them in practice. Although most functional languages are impure (that is, they allow side effects), and such can't count as &quot;declarative&quot;, a few languages are purely functional (that is, they don't allow side effects), most prominently [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#Functional_programming). Purity is key here. In Haskell, [even I/O is pure](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4066401/5249858).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key difference between imperative languages and (purely) functional languages is in the way they describe the program. An imperative program describes *how* to do stuff, that is, algorithms. It specifies the specific instructions that the machine must carry on in order to perform the computation. OTOH, purely functional languages describe *what* is to be computed, that is, the relationship between the input and the output. In mathematics, &quot;function&quot; is just a fancy name for a relationship between an input and an output.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, in the mathematical sense, the only variability is that of the function's arguments. That is, the function's output depends solely on its input (arguments). This is known as [referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency). Referential transparency states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where `ϕ` is the set of all functions, and `δ(f)` is `f`'s domain. For the typical imperative language's definition of &quot;function&quot;, the above doesn't hold. For instance, C's `getchar()` does not always return the same value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's say we want to calculate the set of the ten least prime numbers whose least significant digit is 3. First, in mathematical notation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where `G(n, s)` is the set of the lesser `n`th elements from `s`. In mathematics, you don't worry about how is the set `S` supposed to be computed, but rather about `S`'s definition itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, in Python (in imperative style):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    def is_prime(n):&#xD;&#xA;      for x in range(2, n):&#xD;&#xA;        if n % x == 0:&#xD;&#xA;          return False&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      return True&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    def foo():&#xD;&#xA;      s = set()&#xD;&#xA;      n = 2&#xD;&#xA;      while len(s) &lt; 10:&#xD;&#xA;        if is_prime(n) and n % 10 == 3:&#xD;&#xA;           s.append(n)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      return set(s)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Python, we care about (and are responsible for) the algorithm being used to compute the set. We specify, pretty much in recipe-style, how to build the set from scratch. If there's an algorithm that may be better suited for checking whether a number is prime or odd, but we don't use it, it's our fault, not Python's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Haskell steps in:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    import qualified Data.Set as Set&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    isPrime :: Integer -&gt; Bool&#xD;&#xA;    isPrime n = ( == 1 ) . length . filter ( == 0 ) . map ( n `mod` ) $ [ 2 .. n ]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    s = Set.fromList . take 10 . filter ( ( == 3 ) . ( `mod` 10 ) ) . filter isPrime $ [1..]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haskell's version is a lot more like the mathematical model than Python is. We define the `isPrime` function in terms of the constraints that a prime number must obey, not by describing a step-by-step algorithm to do such a check. Moreover, `s` (the set we have been defining so far) is defined in terms of the constraints its members must obey, rather than in terms of an algorithm to compute `s` itself. The compiler, more often than not [The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.3/docs/html/users_guide/) (a.k.a GHC), is the one responsible for generating an algorithm. GHC's optimizer is known to be one of the strongest in the world, not because its the best compiler of 'em all, but because Haskell's nature allows for this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haskell (and other functional languages), in summary, have several features that make it look, taste, and behave like pure math:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Referential transparency and purity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Haskell is lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [A **very** strong type system](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/279316/what-exactly-makes-the-haskell-type-system-so-revered-vs-say-java), with such exotic (but very useful!) stuff as [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type) (and [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type)) data types.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the bottom line is that AI researchers often prefer functional languages over imperative languages (or, more assertively, pure over impure languages), because they are attempting to *define* artificial intelligence itself, by means of functions (relationship between an input and an output). At the end, we do this because we have no real algorithm for human-level intelligence to raise from a handful of transistors.

It holds conveniently in practice, but the terms come from elsewhere. In 1980, [John Searle][1] coined the following statements:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - AI hypothesis, strong form: an AI system can _think_ and have a _mind_ (in the philosophical definition of the term);&#xD;&#xA; - AI hypothesis, weak form: an AI system can only _act_ like it thinks and has a mind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So _strong AI_ is a shortcut for an AI systems that verifies the _strong AI hypothesis_. Similarly, for the weak form. The terms have then evolved: strong AI refers to AI that performs as well as humans (who have minds), weak AI refers to AI that doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem with these definitions is that they're fuzzy. For example, [AlphaGo][2] is an example of weak AI, but is &quot;strong&quot; by Go-playing standards. A hypothetical AI replicating a human baby would be a strong AI, while being &quot;weak&quot; at most tasks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other terms exist: [Artificial General Intelligence][3] (AGI), which has cross-domain capability (like humans), can learn from a wide range of experiences (like humans), among other features.

If there are too much iterations, your model will become too specific about training samples and will score less using other samples that are not seen during the training phase. This is call over-fitting, though over-fitting is not specific to iterative learning methods.&#xA;&#xA;One solution to prevent over-fitting in these iterative learning algorithms is early stopping. Normally a control group of samples called validation samples (validation set) are used to validate the model and notify when it starts to over-fit. The validation set is not used by the training algorithm however its corresponding outputs are known and after each iteration its samples are employed to measure how good the model currently works. As soon as the performance on the validation set stops to grow and starts to drop we stop iterating the training algorithm. This is called early stopping which can help to maximize the generalization power of our learned model.&#xA;&#xA;Note that if we use the training set itself for validation the performance will always increase because that is what the learning algorithm is designed to do. However the learning algorithm does not know how specific it should be about the training set that is why we need methods like early stopping." />

They can have multiple layers. The significance of the weights is that they make a linear transformation from the output of the previous layer and hand it to the node they are going to. To say it more simplistically, they specify how important (and in what way: negative or positive) is the activation of node they are coming from to activating the node they are going to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your example, since there is only one layer (a row of input nodes and a row of output nodes) it is easy to explain what each node represents.

If each output from the previous layer represents a point in space, a hyperplane decides which part of the space should give a positive value to the plane's corresponding node in the next layer and which part should give a negative input to it. It actually cuts that space into two halves. If you consider the input space of a multi-layer feed forward network, the weights of the first layer parametrize hyperplanes, however in the next layers they can represent non-linear surfaces in the input space." />

There is still momentum due to so many people using it in the past, who are still active in the industry or research (anecdote: the last VCR was produced by a Japanese maker in July 2016, yes). The language is however used (to my knowledge) for the kind of AI that does not leverage Machine Learning, typically as the reference books from Russell and Norvig. These applications are still very useful, but Machine Learning gets all the steam these days.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another reason for the decline is that LISP practitioners have partially moved to Clojure and other recent languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are learning about AI technologies, LISP (or Scheme or Prolog) is good choice to understand what is going on with &quot;AI&quot; at large.

I am aware of some work in universities, and some companies inspired by or directly using LISP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To add on @Harsh's answer, LISP (and Scheme, and Prolog) has qualities that made it look like it was better suited for creating intelligent mechanisms---making AI as perceived in the 60s.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the qualities was that the language design leads the developer to think in a quite elegant way, to decompose a big problem into small problems, etc. Quite &quot;clever&quot;, or &quot;intelligent&quot; if you will. Compared to some other languages, there is almost no choice but to develop that way. LISP is a list processing language, and &quot;purely functional&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One problem, though, can be seen in work related to LISP. A notable one in the AI domain is the work on the [Situation Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus), where (in short) one describes objects and rules in a &quot;world&quot;, and can let it evolve to compute *situations*---states of the world. So it is a model for reasoning on situations. The main problem is called the [frame problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem), meaning this calculus cannot tell what does *not* change---just what changes. Anything that is not defined in the world cannot be processed (note the difference here with ML). First implementations used LISPs, because that was the AI language then. And there were bound by the frame problem. But, as @Harsh mentioned, it is not LISP's fault: Any language would face the same framing issue (a conceptual problem of the Situation Calculus).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the language really does not matter from the AI / AGI / ASI perspective. The concepts (algorithms, etc.) are really what matters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even in Machine Learning, the language is just a practical choice. Python and R are popular today, primarily due to their library ecosystem and the focus of key companies. But try to use Python or R to run a model for a RaspberryPI-based application, and you will face some severe limitations (but still possible, I am doing it :-)). So the language choice burns down to pragmatism." />

I will address the question in the title. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The halting problem is an example of a general phenomenon known as [Undecidability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem), which shows that there are problems no Turing machine can solve in finite time. Let's consider the generalization that it is undecidable whether a Turing Machine satisfies some non-trivial property P, called [Rice's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First note that the halting problem applies only if the Turing machine takes arbitrarily long input. If the input is bounded, it is possible to enumerate all possible cases and the problem is no longer undecidable. It might still be inefficient to calculate it, but then we are turning to the complexity theory, which should be a separate question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rice's theorem implies that an intelligence (a human) cannot be able to determine whether another intelligence (such as an AGI) possesses a certain property, such as being [friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence). This does not mean that we cannot design a Friendly AGI, but it does mean that we cannot check whether an arbitrary AGI is friendly. So, while we can possibly create an AI which is guaranteed to be friendly, we also need to ensure that IT cannot create another AI which is unfriendly. " />

In the eyes themselves, photons are detected by light-sensitive cells and added together to make what are essentially the color elements of pixels. Those are then routed to another layer which does something like edge detection, and then the next layer does something like shape detection, and so on up to higher level concepts like &quot;a cat's face.' If LSD lowers the activation threshold for those neurons, or makes them more excitable, then more things will be interpreted as having the higher level concept (and so a patch of rough texture may have a face jump out of it, for example).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way that CNN &quot;deep dreaming' works is that the base image is amplified. That is, to make a particular patch look more like a dog, the shapes are nudged to be more dog-like, and the shapes nudge the edges, and the edges nudge the pixels." />

Example: &#xD;&#xA; * States = {*sleep*, *eat*, *walk*, *work*}&#xD;&#xA; * Model 1: Most probable sequence on weekdays, say: sleep → sleep → eat → walk → work → work → eat → walk → sleep  → sleep&#xD;&#xA; * Model 2: Most probable sequence on weekends, some: sleep → sleep → eat → walk → eat → walk → sleep → sleep&#xD;&#xA; * New data arrives: Which sequence is more probable that it came from? Check model 1, check model 2. Which fits better? → Assign&#xD;&#xA;* Note that the previous example is oversimplified. Also note that a *unit time* is needed there (other than letters / words, for instance).&#xD;&#xA;* You can *nest* Markov models. That means that you generate a model (a set of probabilities for all the states) in a &quot;lower scale&quot; and then use it in a more abstract model. For example, you can nest your day-scale model to a month or year (to include holidays, for instance).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also [see this link for a nice introduction](http://blog.wolfram.com/2013/02/04/centennial-of-markov-chains/) and [some posts in crossvalidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mcmc?sort=votes&amp;pageSize=50).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the question if artificial intelligence can be created by using this kind of methods, my personal (easy) answer would be **no**, because they only relate data and probabilities and thus belong more to the statistics and machine learning branch. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A longer answer needs to take into account the [weak vs. strong AI question](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/74/what-is-the-difference-between-strong-ai-and-weak-ai)." />

If there are too much iterations, your model will become too specifically trained for the training samples and will score less on other samples that are not seen during the training phase. This is call over-fitting, though over-fitting is not specific to iterative learning methods.&#xA;&#xA;One solution to prevent over-fitting in these iterative learning algorithms is early stopping. Normally a control group of samples called validation samples (validation set) are used to validate the model and notify when it starts to over-fit. The validation set is not used by the training algorithm however its corresponding outputs are known and after each iteration its samples are employed to measure how good the model currently works. As soon as the performance on the validation set stops to grow and starts to drop we stop iterating the training algorithm. This is called early stopping which can help to maximize the generalization power of our learned model.&#xA;&#xA;Note that if we use the training set itself for validation the performance will always increase because that is what the learning algorithm is designed to do. However the learning algorithm does not know how specifically it should learn the training set and that is why we need methods like early stopping." />

Boolean logic means you are working with truth values of either true or false (or 1 or 0 if you prefer). Fuzzy logic is the same apart from you can have truth values which are in-between true and false, that is to say you are working with any number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (inclusive). The fact that you can have a 'partially true and partially false' truth value is where the word &quot;fuzzy&quot; comes from.

Text="'Direct augmentation' of human intelligence, of the sort that you would see in science fiction, looks to be very hard. Most of our promising approaches deal with *avoiding damage* rather than *adding capabilities*--there's no drug that you can take now that will make you smarter to the degree that missing a night of sleep can make you dumber.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most informative area of current practice is probably game-playing, where '[centaurs](http://bloomreach.com/2014/12/centaur-chess-brings-best-humans-machines/),' or humans working with computers, outcompete human players or computer players.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But a centaur player doesn't have a wire jutting out of their skull to jack into the computer; they're looking at a laptop screen. One of the reasons to be pessimistic about cyborg augmentation is because current I/O technology is already so good. Why install a new wire to put information into your visual cortex, when you come already equipped with two? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you could think code directly onto the screen, how much better would that be than typing code through a keyboard? Probably some, but I find it difficult to imagine that it'll be more than twice as good. So most human-computer intelligence augmentation will look like people using software, and software using human inputs, rather than humans and computers evolving together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) and similar approaches cause temporary changes in mental abilities by raising or lowering the activation potentials of neurons in particular regions of the brain. (I've done it myself, a few years ago, and what weak effects I noticed were probably negative. Not too much surprise for a DIY setup!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It looks like it has a number of useful implications. One article about TDCS that I found particularly striking was the journalist who tried it gushing about how their anxiety disappeared for a few days, presumably because the part of their brain behind the anxiety was dampened. One could imagine it being useful for the treatment of many different mental disorders.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I'm pessimistic that it will translate into superior *peak* performance, and I think that's the sort of thing that's more relevant for discussions of augmentation. (Is there TDCS that we could do that would make Terrence Tao better at doing mathematics?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where improved AI methods will come into play is by improving our models of the brain, allowing us to better target interventions, much in the way that AI methods are improving our treatment of cancer (through superior diagnosis and targeting of radiotherapy, as two easy examples). These effects will all be indirect--for example, AI empowering an app or gadget that helps you sleep better won't *directly* augment your intelligence, but will cause population-level increases in effective intelligence through reducing sleep deprivation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't talked yet about nootropics, chemicals that increase intelligence, but it's reasonable to expect that AI will improve drug discovery there like it improves drug discovery for anything else. But the same caveats apply--the effect of nootropics seem to be negatively correlated with intelligence (that is, the smarter someone already is, the harder it is to increase their intelligence further)." />

As part of natural selection, a given environment has a population of individuals that compete for survival and reproduction. The ability of each individual to achieve these goals determines their chance to have children, in other words to pass on their genes to the next generation of individuals, who for genetic reasons will have an increased chance of doing well, even better, in realizing these two objectives. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This principle of continuous improvement over the generations is taken by evolutionary algorithms to optimize solutions to a problem. In the **initial generation**, a population composed of different **individuals** is generated randomly or by other methods. An individual is a solution to the problem, more or less good: the quality of the individual in regards to the problem is called **fitness**, which reflects the adequacy of the solution to the problem to be solved. The higher the fitness of an individual, the higher it is likely to pass some or all of its genotype to the individuals of the next generation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An individual is coded as a **genotype**, which can have any shape, such as a** bit vector (**genetic algorithms**) or a vector of real (evolution strategies). Each genotype is transformed into a **phenotype** when assessing the individual, i.e. when its fitness is calculated. In some cases, the phenotype is identical to the genotype: it is called **direct** **coding**. Otherwise, the coding is called indirect. For example, suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped defined by its length, height and width. To simplify the example, assume that these three quantities are integers between 0 and 15. We can then describe each of them using a 4-bit binary number. An example of a potential solution may be to genotype 0001 0111 01010. The corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1, height 7 and width 10.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During the transition from the old to the new generation are called **variation** **operators**, whose purpose is to manipulate individuals. There are two distinct types of variation operators:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* the **mutation** **operators**, which are used to introduce variations within the same individual, as genetic mutations;&#xD;&#xA;* the **crossover** **operators**, which are used to cross at least two different genotypes, as genetic crosses from breeding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Evolutionary algorithms have proven themselves in various fields such as operations research, robotics, biology, nuance, or cryptography. In addition, they can optimize multiple objectives simultaneously and can be used as black boxes because they do not assume any properties in the mathematical model to optimize. Their only real limitation is the computational complexity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wweBO.png" />

To evolve images, both the directly encoded and indirectly encoded images, we use the [Sferes](https://github.com/jbmouret/sferes2) evolutionary framework. The entire code base to conduct the evolutionary experiments can be download [sic] [here](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling). The code for the images produced by gradient ascent is available [here](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling/tree/master/caffe/ascent).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Images that are actually random junk were correctly recognized as nothing meaningful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In response to an unrecognizable image, the networks could have output a low confidence for each of the 1000 classes, instead of an extremely high confidence value for one of the classes. In fact, they do just that for randomly generated images (e.g. those in generation 0 of the evolutionary run)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The original goal of the researchers was to use the neural networks to automatically generate images that look like the real things (by getting the recognizer's feedback and trying to change the image to get a more confident result), but they ended up creating the above art. Notice how even in the static-like images there are little splotches - usually near the center - which, it's fair to say, are triggering the recognition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We were not trying to produce adversarial, unrecognizable images. Instead, we were trying to produce recognizable images, but these unrecognizable images emerged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Evidently, these images had just the right distinguishing features to match what the AI looked for in pictures. The &quot;paddle&quot; image does have a paddle-like shape, the &quot;bagel&quot; is round and the right color, the &quot;projector&quot; image is a camera-lens-like thing, the &quot;computer keyboard&quot; is a bunch of rectangles (like the individual keys), and the &quot;chainlink fence&quot; legitimately looks like a chain-link fence to me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Figure 8. Evolving images to match DNN classes produces a tremendous diversity of images. Shown are images selected to showcase diversity from 5 evolutionary runs. The diversity suggests that the images are non-random, but that instead evolutions producing [sic] discriminative features of each target class.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further reading: [the original paper](http://www.evolvingai.org/files/DNNsEasilyFooled_cvpr15.pdf) (large PDF)" />

Let's consider the generalization that it is undecidable whether a Turing Machine satisfies some non-trivial property P, called [Rice's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First note that the halting problem applies only if the Turing machine takes arbitrarily long input. If the input is bounded, it is possible to enumerate all possible cases and the problem is no longer undecidable. It might still be inefficient to calculate it, but then we are turning to the complexity theory, which should be a separate question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rice's theorem implies that an intelligence (a human) cannot be able to determine whether another intelligence (such as an AGI) possesses a certain property, such as being [friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence).

Text="The following thread has many answers regarding why LISP used to be thought of as the AI language: [Why is Lisp used for AI][1] and the following is an answer by Peter Norvig, who wrote a popular textbook on the subject and is currently Director of Research at Google: [Is it true that Lisp is highly used programming language in AI?][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not overly familiar with the history, but I think LISP was oversold to industry as &quot;the AI language&quot;. It is a good language for humans to think in and pioneered many important ideas which have since been incorporated into many modern languages (see [the Wikipedia page][3]), but it is no way the &quot;best&quot;. It was likely also popular because it is very expressive: you can write short programs to represent complex ideas, a property it shares with other functional languages in use such as Scala. This also means that it is easy to write a program that is very hard to debug in LISP. Modern functional languages have been trying to do better in this regard through typing etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The paradigm for AI that currently receives most attention is Machine Learning, i.e. learning hypothesis from data, as opposed to previous approaches like Expert Systems where experts wrote rules for the AI to follow. Python is currently the most widely used language for prototyping machine learning algorithms and has many libraries and an active community. Another important detail about modern AI is the volume of data it uses. Big Data analysis is done using cluster computing systems like Hadoop (with code written in Java) and Spark (with code written in Python or Scala). Often, the core time-intensive subroutines are written in C, but this is often done in the form of third-party libraries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally it must be said that the AI Winter of the 80s was not because we did not have the right language, but because we did not have the right algorithms and did not have enough computational power. This has changed as GPUs have gotten better. If you're trying to learn AI, spend your time studying algorithms and not languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/130475/why-is-lisp-used-for-ai&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-Lisp-is-highly-used-programming-language-in-AI&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" />

It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is designed to emphasize usability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Python allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in many other languages such as [tag:C], and the language has constructs intended to be used to create clear programs in a variety of domains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two similar but incompatible versions of Python are in widespread use (2 and 3). Please consider mentioning the version and implementation that you are using when asking a question about Python.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of [tag:Scheme], [tag:Ruby], [tag:Perl] and [tag:Tcl].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like other [dynamic languages][4], Python is often used as a [scripting language][5], but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[tag:CPython], the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in [*The Zen of Python*][6] written by Tim Peters, which can be revealed by issuing this command at the interactive interpreter:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt;&gt;&gt; import this&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The documentation can also be accessed offline for your installation of Python in the following manner:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Going into `Your_Python_install_dir/Doc`. There is a complete Python documentation present for the version of Python installed on your computer.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Running `pydoc x` or `python -m pydoc x` from the command prompt or terminal displays documentation for module `x`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unlike many other languages Python uses an indentation based syntax and this may take some getting used to for programmers familiar with braces for syntax.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import braces&#xD;&#xA;      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1&#xD;&#xA;    SyntaxError: not a chance&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To help with the transition it is a recommendation to use a properly configured text-editor created for programmers or an IDE. Python comes with a basic IDE called [IDLE][7] to get you started. Other popular examples are the charity-ware [tag:vim], the free GNU [tag:Emacs], [tag:Eclipse]+[tag:PyDev] or [tag:PyCharm]. Take a look at this [IDE comparison list][8] for many other alternatives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;## Tagging recommendation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Use the [tag:python] tag for all Python related questions. If you believe your question includes issues specific to individual versions, use [tag:python-3.x] or [tag:python-2.7] in addition to the main [tag:python] tag. If you believe your question may be even more specific, you can include a version specific tag such as [tag:python-3.5].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, consider including the tag for the specific implementation if you are using one other than [tag:CPython] - the use of [tag:CPython] is assumed unless explicitly stated otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;## References&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Official documentation for the current stable versions: [2.7.x][9] and [3.5.x][10].&#xD;&#xA;- Release notes for the current stable versions: [2.7.11][11] and [3.5.1][12].&#xD;&#xA;- [Python (programming language)][13] (Wikipedia)&#xD;&#xA;- [Python for Programmers][14]&#xD;&#xA;- [Python - Quick Guide][15]&#xD;&#xA;- [Getting started with Python][16]&#xD;&#xA;- [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3][17]&#xD;&#xA;- The non-profit [Python Software Foundation][18] manages [CPython][19].&#xD;&#xA;- [PSF][18] License Agreement for Python [2.7.x][20] and [3.5.x][21]&#xD;&#xA;- [Stackoverflow Documentation][72]&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;## Popular [web frameworks][22] based on Python&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your question has to do with any of these frameworks, please ensure you include the appropriate tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [**Django**][23] [tag:django]&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    The Web framework for perfectionists (with deadlines). Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code. Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

A supercomputer larger than that 37 petaflop estimate [exists today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But emulation is hard. See [this SO question about hardware emulation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/471973/what-makes-building-game-console-emulators-so-hard) or [this article](http://www.tested.com/tech/gaming/2712-why-perfect-hardware-snes-emulation-requires-a-3ghz-cpu/) on emulating the SNES, in which they require **140 times** the processing power of the SNES chip to get it right. [This 2013 article](http://gizmodo.com/an-83-000-processor-supercomputer-only-matched-one-perc-1045026757) claims that a second of human brain activity took 40 minutes to emulate on a 10 petaflop computer (a *2400-times* slowdown, not the 4-times slowdown one might naively expect).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And all this assumes that neurons are relatively simple objects! It could be that the amount of math we have to do to model a single neuron is actually much more than the flops estimate above. Or it could be the case that dramatic simplifications can be made, and if we knew what the brain was actually trying to accomplish we could do it much more cleanly and simply. (One advantage that ANNs have, for example, is that they are doing computations with much more precision than we expect biological neurons to have.

I'm adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them. If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the Not Appropriate section will lead to your paper being *instantly* rejected from any top-tier journal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a &quot;fitness function&quot; that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Crossover functions are easy to define and natural**: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.&#xD;&#xA;- This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don't have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.&#xD;&#xA; - **Black Box evaluation**: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try. &#xD;&#xA;- **Exception: Simulations**. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. [modelling locomotion patterns][1]. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. [PDE constrained optimization][2], so this may change in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not Appropriate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - **You can calculate a gradient** for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this. &#xD;&#xA;  - **You know the fitness function in closed form**: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting [automatic differentiation][3]. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use [subgradient descent][4].&#xD;&#xA;  - Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a **linear program or a quadratic program**: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible. &#xD;&#xA;  - **Your solution space is small**: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies. I am biased towards [CMA-ES][5], which I think is a good simple algorithm that captures the notion of a gradient in the fitness landscape in a way that traditional GAs do not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES" />

Humankind would be unable to predict any future events, or explain any present events, as science itself becomes incapable of describing machine-triggered events. Essentially, machines would think of us the same way we think of ants. Thus, we can make no predictions past the singularity. Furthermore, as a logical consequence, we'ld be unable to define the point at which the singularity may occur at all, or even recognize it when it happens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in order for the singularity to take place, AGI needs to be developed, and [whether that is possible is quite a hot debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#Feasibility) right now. Moreover, an algorithm that creates superhuman intelligence out of bits and bytes would have to be designed. By definition, a human programmer wouldn't be able to do such a thing, as his/her brain would need to be able to comprehend concepts beyond its range. There is also the argument that an intelligence explosion (the mechanism by which a technological singularity would theoretically be formed) would be impossible due to the difficulty of the design challenge of making itself more intelligent, getting larger proportionally to its intelligence, and that the difficulty of the design itself may overtake the intelligence required to solve said challenge (last point credit to `god of llamas` in the comments).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, there are related theories involving machines taking over humankind and all of that sci-fi narrative.

I'm adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them. If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the Not Appropriate section will lead to your paper being *instantly* rejected from any top-tier journal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a &quot;fitness function&quot; that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Crossover functions are easy to define and natural**: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.&#xD;&#xA;- This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don't have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.&#xD;&#xA; - **Black Box evaluation**: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try. &#xD;&#xA;- **Exception: Simulations**. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. [modelling locomotion patterns][1]. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. [PDE constrained optimization][2], so this may change in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not Appropriate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - **You can calculate a gradient** for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this. &#xD;&#xA;  - **You know the fitness function in closed form**: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting [automatic differentiation][3], so you don't even need to do it manually. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use [subgradient descent][4].&#xD;&#xA;  - Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a **linear program or a quadratic program**: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible. &#xD;&#xA;  - **Your solution space is small**: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies. I am biased towards [CMA-ES][5], which I think is a good simple algorithm that captures the notion of a gradient in the fitness landscape in a way that traditional GAs do not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES" />

The reason to do this is to make the influence of confounders independent from the influence of the factor under investigation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But randomness only works for this *in expectation*. If we actually knew what the confounders were, we could do a paired assignment (or a similar scheme) that ensured the various groups were matched *as well as possible*, instead of us just not knowing ahead of time which way the bias went.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some cases where pseudorandomness, rather than full randomness, will impair training AI designs. A simple example would be a case where you want to randomly initialize weights in a network where the number of parameters exceeds the periodicity of the RNG; this means that while you have as many possible networks as there are possible unique seeds, you can't actually visit the entire weight space that you wanted to sample over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think any of those cases are limiting factors, however.

In such a case, success at an 'EQ test' is not really grounded in the real-world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an essay entitled &quot;The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to 'understand' analogy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and&#xD;&#xA;his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane&#xD;&#xA;winds up pregnant by Buck. She has the baby but doesn't want it, and so, aided&#xD;&#xA;by her husband, she drowns the baby in a river, thus &quot;neatly solving &quot;the problem&quot;&#xD;&#xA;of Bambi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This story is presented to ACME in the following form:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ql: (neglectful-husband (Sluggo))&#xD;&#xA;    q2: (lonely-and-sex-starved-wife (Jane-Doe))&#xD;&#xA;    q3: (macho-ladykiller (Buck-Stag))&#xD;&#xA;    q4: (poor-innocent-little-fetus (Bambi))&#xD;&#xA;    q5: (takes-out-to-local-bar (Sluggo Jane-Doe Buck-Stag))&#xD;&#xA;    ...&#xD;&#xA;    q11: (neatly-solves-the-problem-of (Jane-Doe Bambi))&#xD;&#xA;    q12: (cause (ql0 q11))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose the program were to be asked if Jane Doe's behavior was moral. Complex compound emotional concepts such as 'neglectful', 'lonely' and 'innocent' are here simply predicates, not available to the AI for deeper introspective examination. They could just as easily be replaced by labels such as as 'bling-blang -blong'. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in one sense, the absence of success at an EQ depth with any depth is indicative of the general problem currently facing AI: the inability to define (or otherwise learn) meaningful representations of subtle complexities of the human world, which is a lot more complex than being able to recognize videos of cats." />

In such a case, success at an 'EQ test' is not really grounded in the real-world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an essay entitled &quot;The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to 'understand' analogy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and&#xD;&#xA;his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane&#xD;&#xA;winds up pregnant by Buck. She has the baby but doesn't want it, and so, aided&#xD;&#xA;by her husband, she drowns the baby in a river, thus &quot;neatly solving &quot;the problem&quot;&#xD;&#xA;of Bambi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This story is presented to ACME in the following form:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ql: (neglectful-husband (Sluggo))&#xD;&#xA;    q2: (lonely-and-sex-starved-wife (Jane-Doe))&#xD;&#xA;    q3: (macho-ladykiller (Buck-Stag))&#xD;&#xA;    q4: (poor-innocent-little-fetus (Bambi))&#xD;&#xA;    q5: (takes-out-to-local-bar (Sluggo Jane-Doe Buck-Stag))&#xD;&#xA;    ...&#xD;&#xA;    q11: (neatly-solves-the-problem-of (Jane-Doe Bambi))&#xD;&#xA;    q12: (cause (ql0 q11))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose the program were to be asked if Jane Doe's behavior was moral. Complex compound emotional concepts such as 'neglectful', 'lonely' and 'innocent' are here simply predicates, not available to the AI for deeper introspective examination. They could just as easily be replaced by labels such as as 'bling-blang-blong15657'. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in one sense, the absence of success at an EQ depth with any depth is indicative of the general problem currently facing AI: the inability to define (or otherwise learn) meaningful representations of subtle complexities of the human world, which is a lot more complex than being able to recognize videos of cats." />

Predicting long-term weather is quite difficult, because it is a chaotic system where small changes can lead to very different results. Using Monte Carlo methods, you could run a large number of simulations, each with slightly different atmospheric changes. Then you can analyze the results and for example calculate the probability of rain on a given day based on how many simulations ended up with rain. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the use of Monte Carlo in Alpha Go, they seem to be using the so-called [Monte Carlo Tree Search][3]. In this approach, you make a tree of possible moves, a few turns into the future, and try to find the best sequence. However, since the number of possible moves in the game of go is very large, you won't be able to explore very far ahead. This means that some of the moves which look good now might turn out to be bad later. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in the Monte Carlo Tree Search, you pick a promising sequence of moves and run one or more simulations of how the game might proceed from that point. Then you can use the results of that simulation to get a better idea of how good that specific sequence of moves really is and you update the tree accordingly. Repeat as needed until you find a good move.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want more information or to look at some illustrations, I found an interesting paper on the topic: C.

That is, [subsumption architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture) is one in which the 'autopilot' is *replaced* by a more sophisticated system when necessary. (All pieces receive the raw sensory inputs, and output actions, some of which turn off or on other systems.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But a better approach is the normal hierarchical control approach, in which the target of a lower level system is the output of a higher level system. That is, the targeted joint angle of a robot leg is determined by the system that is trying to optimize the velocity, which is determined by a system that is trying to optimize the trajectory, which is determined by a system that is trying to optimize the target position, and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This allows for increasing level of complexity while maintaining detail and system reusability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I don't think you actually need what one would naively call 'embodied cognition' in order to get the bottom-up hierarchy of competencies that Brooks is right to point towards. The core feature is the wide array of inputs and outputs, which are understood in a hierarchical fashion that allows systems to be chained together vertically. I think you could get a functional general intelligence whose only inputs and outputs involve going through an Ethernet cable, and doesn't have anything like a traditional body that it actuates or senses through. (This is a claim that the hierarchical structure is what matters, not the content of what we use that structure for.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(The main place to look for more, I think, is actually a book about *human* cognition, called The Control of Perception by William T. Powers.)" />

This is very different to how humans learn by creating concepts, relationship, common sense reasoning which gives ability to learn much without too much data. Therefore machine learning with common-sense reasoning capabilities should be researched further more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Decision techniques.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Current AI-based systems have very limited ability for making decisions, therefore new techniques must be developed (e.g. modeling systemic risks, analyzing tradeoffs, detecting anomalies in context, analyzing data while preserving privacy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Domain-specific AI systems.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The current AI-based system is lack of abilities to understand the variety of domains of human expertise (such as medicine, engineering, law and many more). The systems should be able to perform professional-level tasks such as designing problems, experiments, managing contradictions, negotiating, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Data assurance and trust.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The current AI-based systems require huge amounts of data and their behaviour directly depends on the quality of this data which can be biased, incomplete or compromised. This can be expensive and time consuming especially where it is used for safety critical systems which potentially can be very dangerous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Radically efficient computing infrastructure.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The current AI-based systems require unprecedented workloads and computing power which require development of new computing architectures (such as neuromorphic).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Interpretability and explanations.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  For people to follow AI suggestions, they need to trust systems, and this is only when they are capable of knowing users' intents, priorities, reasoning and they can learn from their mistakes. These capabilities are required in many business domains and professionals&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Value alignment and ethics.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Humans can share the common knowledge of how the world function, the machine cannot. They can fail by having unintended and unexpected behaviour only because humans did not specify the right goals for them or them omitted essential training details. The systems should be able to correct specification of the goals and avoid unintended and undesired consequences in the behaviour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Social AI.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The AI-based systems should be able to work closely to humans in their professional and personal life, therefore they should have significant social capabilities, because they can impact on our emotions and our decision making capabilities. Also sophisticated natural language capabilities will need to be developed to allow a natural interaction and dialog between humans and machines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: [Fundamental questions in AI research, and the most important research gaps (RFI questions 5 and 6)][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/rfi-preparing-future-artificial-intelligence&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/ostp/document4.shtml" />

In other words, even CNs have a hard time generalizing too far *beyond* what they learned from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The recognition limit is hard to define precisely.

I present here one of them, for its generality and simplicity (that makes it easy to remember too). But first, the general idea behind these approaches is pretty interesting, around a mechanism called [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stigmergy is a behaviour coordination mechanism mediated by the environment. It was first described for termites, and the most famous example pertains to ants. Ants form trails when going out for food, but they often do not interact *directly*. It turns out they leave pheromones on the ground as they walk away from their hills. The pheromone allows them to find their way home, and it also guides where they are going: If they find a pheromone trace from one of their peers, they follow it and their own pheromones *add up*, reinforcing the signal of the trail. In stage, more and more ants get &quot;together as they move&quot;, forming a trail. Coordination has been achieved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Among the various implementation derived from stigmergy, there is the &quot;field-based motion coordination model&quot; (FBMCM). The idea is to create a (maybe virtual) environment that maintains some states of the world. Each object registers in the environment a signal that is maximum at the object position (its edges) and then decreases with distance. Moving objects (e.g. robots) each emit a signal relayed by the environment. They can then sense each other's field and act accordingly: E.g., when signals are strong, move away; when weak, it is safe to get closer, etc. Several complex group moves have been demonstrated in software simulators (platoon formation in games, drill simulations) and with robots. The benefit of this approach is that it can be cheap to compute even complex behaviours. For example, avoiding clashes requires simple &quot;logic&quot; code based on summing-up nearby fields value. FBMCM is pretty slick, used in video-games, but hard to implement in physical settings (to my *dating* knowledge), as it can be challenging to build a reliable environment. See for example the work from [Mamei and Zambonelli](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949751_Field-based_Motion_Coordination_In_Quake_3_Arena), as well as one of the first industrial implementations for robots by [Weyns et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221456459_Decentralized_control_of_E%27GV_transportation_systems). Note that the implementation for robots required significant work on the environment infrastructure, made somewhat more feasible as it was a controlled warehouse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The advantage of stigmergy-like models is that they are often *simple* and *resilient*: You can lose an ant without impact on the food-finding trail. On the downside, these models are usually *slow*, as the coordination takes time to emerge from indirect interactions. This can be improved upon by adding extra direct interactions (e.g. empowering ants with a GPS and a grocery store map, or just a magnetic-North sense).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practice, these models can collapse if the environment implementation is not reliable. It can be difficult for robots or, say, self-driving cars, if they expect some transponders put on their way, as these devices are expensive to set and maintain, and they can be broken or stolen. It would be better to endow robots with radars, sonars or other proximity sensors to implement stigmergic models. One related example is the decision by Tesla to add radars to its cars, instead of assuming reliable transponders on the road (*note*: This is just a parallel; there is no official relation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other implementations and related models are, for example, tuple-based coordination languages such as [Linda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)), and network protocols like [Chord](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf). As you see, these works are not necessarily in the &quot;AI domain&quot;." />

Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;• a must create an artifact o of type t;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;• o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is&#xD;&#xA;any criterion expressible in natural language;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;• a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied&#xD;&#xA;that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;• a human referee r determines the combination of t and C&#xD;&#xA;to not be unrealistic for an average human.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to *compare* the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result)." />

However, computers can now defeat grandmasters at chess, and people are no longer saying that it is a form of intelligence. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now we have OCR.

However, computers can now defeat grandmasters at chess, and people are no longer saying that it is a form of intelligence. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now we have OCR.

Computer Science), and implementation to Software Engineering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's take a concrete example, really outside of AI: Find the minimum value of a given polynomial, if it exists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Mathematician will derivate the polynomial, find the zeros, and checkout convexity to find a minimum (if there is any zero). This procedure is very standard---some will say straightforward. It relies on a body of knowledge and an abstraction level that is appropriate for manual proof.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Software Engineer approach is actually way longer to explain, and I am going to skip it. The point is that the body of knowledge is related but different: We have to find now a step-by-step procedure for the computer to achieve the result. The Mathematician one could be implemented directly in MathLab, almost verbatim, but we *assume* MathLab. And to build MathLab, we are back to the problem of making a procedure the computer can execute. We could for example base a procedure on Euler's method to find roots (a &quot;simple&quot; approach that closes on roots step after step), etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simple mathematical operations can be quite complex to implement on a computer. Perhaps the most famous is [random-number generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation). Mathematically, the concept is pure and clear. Generating an actual random-number is more elusive than it looks, to the point it calls for new *models* and new *implementations*...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A concrete example from history: Neural networks. In the 80s and 90s, NNs were weighted graphs that could be executed on computers using graph libraries or similar foundation libs. Choosing the weights was challenging. One day the back-propagation learning model was introduced to automated the choice of weights. The model relied on a procedure dedicated to NNs, using a terminology like partial derivates, gradient descent, chain rules, etc. And later then, clever engineers created libraries to automate the back-propagation procedure. The libraries can be somewhat far from the original model, as engineers learn how to make it computable, even faster (i.e. optimization, approximations/truncations)." />

[Here's](https://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-defeats-alphago-masterful-comeback-game-4/) an article explaining it. Short version: yes, we know what went wrong, but probably not how to fix it yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, AlphaGo is good at making lots of small decisions well, and managing risk and uncertainty better than humans can. One of the things that's surprising about it relative to previous bots that play Go is how good it was at tactical fights; in previous games, Lee had built a position that AlphaGo needed to attack, and then AlphaGo successfully attacked it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in this game, Lee played the reverse strategy. Instead of trying to win many different influence battles, where AlphaGo had already shown it was stronger than him, he would set up one critical battle (incurring minor losses along the way), and then defeat it there, with ripple events that would settle the match in his favor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what's the weakness of AlphaGo that allowed that to work? As I understand it, this is a fundamental limitation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). MCTS works by randomly sampling game trees and averaging them; if 70% of games from a particular position go well and 30% of games from another position go well, then you should probably play the first move instead of the second move.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But when there's a specific sequence of plays that go well--if, say, W has a path that requires them playing exactly the right stone each time, but B has no possible response to this path--then MCTS breaks down, because you can only find that narrow path through minimax reasoning, and moving from the slower minimax reasoning to the faster MCTS is one of the big reasons why bots are better now than they were in the past.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's unclear how to get around this. There may be a way to notice this sort of threat, and then temporarily switch from MCTS reasoning to minimax reasoning, or to keep around particular trajectories in memory for consideration in future plays.

Each such agent implements a function&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time&#xD;&#xA;&gt; planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; learning as extending the reach of the designer into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the example you cite, &quot;autopilot for cars/planes&quot;, is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances.

There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular [neural net][3], through to probabilistic models like [bayesian networks (belief networks)][4] - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Global-ebook/dp/9332543518/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://fortune.com/2015/10/16/how-tesla-autopilot-learns/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network" />

The report also said that a human driver would have been unable to make the difference either. In other words, the car sensors (presumably camera) and the human eye could not have detected an obstacle, and could not have triggered any safety measure.

If we don't set things up correctly beforehand, we won't get a chance to fix it afterwards, because AI will have effective control.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are three main areas of discussion with regards to the Control Problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Whether or not the problem is urgent. Many AI experts, cognizant of the difficulty of getting simple systems to work effectively today, think that AI able to take control is not urgent, and as detail-minded engineers, they think it will be profoundly difficult to do any useful work today. (Andrew Ng, for example, famously called these sorts of worries like worrying about overpopulation on Mars.) Given radical uncertainty among AI experts as to when this will become an issue, however, this means we can't rule out rapid AI timescales, and should do at least some work in anticipation of those timescales.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Whether or not the problem is hard. Many people give short, simple, and wrong solutions to the control problem. Probably the most famous is the idea that intelligence and morality are inherently interlinked, and thus a more intelligent machine, *by definition*, will be more moral. The Orthogonality Thesis is the claim of the opposite, that intelligence and morality (or, more specifically, goal alignment) are unrelated things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. What foundations we can lay now. There are a bunch of open problems (see, for example, [MIRI's technical agenda](https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/)) that deal with mathematical logic of the sort that would be useful for ensuring robust value alignment, or on how to effectively do value learning (without giving an incentive to distort values), or on how to build value functions and goals such that they are fixable if they turn out to be mistaken. Those look like problems that we can do useful work on now, even without knowing what the actual structure of a future AI will look like." />

Examples might not be 100% accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the simplest form, network is trained using the apriori information extracted from the ground truth. This basically means that ANN uses the relation between the input and output. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, if you are to classify shrubs and trees, one of the input could be height and the other could be the width of the tree. Now, if you have only input and output layers, increasing height means increasing chance for the object to be a tree. Thus, input height would have a positive weight connecting to tree output and a negative weight to shrub output. However, as the plant gets wider, the chance of it being a shrub increases. Taller shrubs are wider than shorter ones. Thus input weight would have positive weight connecting to the shrub output. Finally, the chance of being a tree is not affected by the width and thus will have close to 0 weight between this input and output. This network will effectively work like a linear discriminant classifier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now instead of assigning weights by hand, you may use a learning algorithm that tries to adjust weights so that the output is correct when the series of input is supplied. Ideally this training algorithm should reach to the conclusion that we have made in the previous example. Most training algorithms are recursive. They supply the inputs multiple times, and in a simple sense, they reward pathways that are correct by increasing their weights and punishes pathways that are causing incorrect answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When hidden layers are used in a system, they would be able to correlate input on higher degrees. Thus, as the number of layers get higher, ANN learns the input set much better. However, this does not mean it gets better. If the ANN over fits the input set, it would be affected from the random noise that is in the dataset. This problem is generally referred as memorization. There are learning algorithms that try to minimize memorization and maximize generalization ability. But ultimately, the number of training samples should be high enough so that ANN cannot overfit to the data." />

Humankind would be unable to predict any future events, or explain any present events, as science itself becomes incapable of describing machine-triggered events. Essentially, machines would think of us the same way we think of ants. Thus, we can make no predictions past the singularity. Furthermore, as a logical consequence, we'd be unable to define the point at which the singularity may occur at all, or even recognize it when it happens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in order for the singularity to take place, AGI needs to be developed, and [whether that is possible is quite a hot debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#Feasibility) right now. Moreover, an algorithm that creates superhuman intelligence out of bits and bytes would have to be designed. By definition, a human programmer wouldn't be able to do such a thing, as his/her brain would need to be able to comprehend concepts beyond its range. There is also the argument that an intelligence explosion (the mechanism by which a technological singularity would theoretically be formed) would be impossible due to the difficulty of the design challenge of making itself more intelligent, getting larger proportionally to its intelligence, and that the difficulty of the design itself may overtake the intelligence required to solve said challenge (last point credit to [god of llamas](http://ai.stackexchange.com/users/47/god-of-llamas) in the comments).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, there are related theories involving machines taking over humankind and all of that sci-fi narrative.

Even if Asimov's laws were not enough, a series of constraints would still be necessary in order to avoid the misuse of AGI by misintentioned individuals, and Asimov's laws are the nearest we have to that." />

Text="Instead of talking about just SAT solvers, let me talk about optimization in general. Many economic problems can be cast as optimization problems: for example, FedEx may have a list of packages and the destinations for those packages, and must decide which packages to put on which trucks, and what order to deliver those packages in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you write out a mathematical description of this problem, there are a truly stunning number of possible solutions, and a well-defined way to evaluate which of two solutions is better. A solver is an algorithm that will evaluate a solution, come up with another solution, and then evaluate that one, and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In small cases and simple problems, the solver can also terminate with a proof that it is actually the best solution possible. But typically instead the solver just reports &quot;this is the best solution that I've seen,&quot; and that's used. An improvement in the solver means you can reliably get lower-cost solutions than you were seeing before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the SAT problem specifically, the Wikipedia page on [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) gives some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Since the SAT problem is NP-complete, only algorithms with exponential worst-case complexity are known for it. In spite of this, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade[when?] and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints (i.e. clauses).[1] Examples of such problems in electronic design automation (EDA) include formal equivalence checking, model checking, formal verification of pipelined microprocessors,[12] automatic test pattern generation, routing of FPGAs,[14] planning, and scheduling problems, and so on.

I believe it depends on specific countries and unions and how quickly we're able to advance and be ready for such change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To support above points and summarize the 'only self-driving cars' point, please see below references which shows that this is already happening:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 2014: [Uber will eventually replace all its drivers with self-driving cars][7]&#xD;&#xA;- 2016: [Google's self-driving car system has been officially recognised as a driver in the US.][8]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; The move is seen as a first step towards changing the law for cars that have &quot;no need for a human driver&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 2016: [Beverly Hills to replace public transport with self-driving cars][9]&#xD;&#xA;- 2016: [San Francisco pitches $149 million plan to replace cars with self-driving vehicles][11]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; San Francisco’s future is autonomous and shared vehicles – and that future may be only a decade away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 2016: [Otto Self-Driving Truck Company Wants to Replace Teamsters][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braking_distance&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/cz9yP.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.cyberphysics.co.uk/topics/forces/stopping_distance.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36823&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.slideshare.net/sbishop2/p22-car-design-safety&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Nice_attack&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5758734/uber-will-eventually-replace-all-its-drivers-with-self-driving-cars&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://www.dezeen.com/2016/02/12/google-self-driving-car-artficial-intelligence-system-recognised-as-driver-usa/&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/19/beverly-hills-replace-public-transport-driverless-cars-los-angeles/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/otto-selfdriving-truck-company-wants-to-replace-teamsters&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-pitches-149-million-plan-replace-cars-self-driving-vehicles/" />

To me, it feels a bit like *playing god*: Artificial (given) Intelligence would hence imply Artificial (given) Personality. This approach to the problem seems to be supported by the next fragment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a notion of personality is useful&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I point to the above because I don't think that artificial intelligence... ***Intelligence*** itself, actually, need to be given or assigned, or even have a *use* in the sense of a *purpose*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The previous note** was about *emergence*, which is a topic that [user217281728](http://ai.stackexchange.com/users/42/user217281728) briefly addressed in [their answer](http://ai.stackexchange.com/a/1596/70). In this second approach, the particular traits *just happen*, or *develop*. The interaction between the (so-called) agents and their environment, as well as fellow agents can give place to new behaviour patterns, not designed beforehand. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In an evolutionary** approach, if the personality would happen to have an advantage (or at least not represent a disadvantage), then it could just appear. Of course, I am making a number of assumptions and demarcations here as well:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* I am thinking about embodied intelligence&#xD;&#xA;* I speak of evolutionary robotics&#xD;&#xA;* I think on social issues being of importance&#xD;&#xA;* I assume that *personality* could emerge&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Now, an example** that I find extremely interesting is that of the little mobile robots which could move around and end-up in a pool of *food* or a pool of *poison*. And they, somehow, by some odd chance, recognised or made a relation between signals sent by other robots, and the presence of food. Or not. That was more or less the thing: Some robots (kind of) learned to *conceal* information and thus had more time to eat themselves. Well, I would have a couple of personality adjectives for such guys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here you find the article](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15786.full) and [here you find some videos](https://wp.unil.ch/mitrilab/) and related stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**And with that**, we land at my last point: [We humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism#In_computing) put the adjectives, according to our social conditioning. We call [Marvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_(character)) *depressive* and [R2D2](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-do-we-love-r2-d2-and-not-c-3po-180951176/) lovely and charming. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If they perceive their personalities as constructive or damaging, will always depend on our own judgment. In the end, it is quite common under humans to disagree on personality issues, too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Bonus**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember when [HAL got emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgkyrW2NiwM), on the face of death?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It gets *human* when it loses its cool, before the flawed-personality human astronaut :)" />

This is not optimal for Machine Learning, which works when we have a large pool of examples, and we don't know the ruleset; it will figure it out. Even if you were to train an Neural Network to process that input, there are several things you must account for:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**1. Variance in data.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not all webpages are equal in length or complexity, and making a neural network to generate output from HTML would produce garbage most of the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**2. Training time.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The time it would take for a neural network to understand HTML tags, attributes, the DOM Tree, and each and every element, including new ones being added every few years, and how each one renders and behaves, would take an extremely long time, most likely several years on a fast computer, if it even were possible&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3. Interactivity.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Web pages aren't just static, they change according HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Not only would you have to design your system to account for the rendering step, you would also make it have to understand the [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) scripting language [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), as well as the less complicated, but inherently intertwined with HTML, CSS stylesheet language. If you thought the rendering process was easy, try training a neural network to handle complicated scripting patterns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**4. New Standards**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not all HTML is equal, because of different standards. [WHATWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group) began working on HTML5 in 2004, and browsers started to implement not long after. In 2004, there were very few examples of HTML5 sites to train your network to begin with. Sure, now it's standardized and every website uses it, but what about HTML6? When the first specification is released (probably 2017-2025), virtually no websites will use it, because no one will support it. Only when it finally becomes standard, probably in the late 2020s or early 2030s, will you have enough data to train your monstrous system of neural networks&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for AI in general, one could argue that browsers already use A.I. in their rendering process. They intelligently decide what to render (taking CSS into account), when in order to get the most efficient render time, they selectively use different JavaScript parsers on different sections of the code to optimize the speed, the whole system has been optimized on another ruleset to make rendering and interacting with a webpage as seamless and easy-to-use as possible. Your system will never be as good as what hundreds of humans have optimized over 20 years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trying to solve HTML rendering with Neural Networks is akin to trying to nail a nail with a screwdriver. It's just not going to work&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope this was helpful!" />

Text="Tesla's technology is assistive, as Alexey points out, so this is not a case of an autonomous system (e.g. an AGI) doing some fatal stunt (the product name AutoPilot is famously misleading). Now on why the car assistance led to this tragic accident, there is some information related to AI technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;_Warning: I cannot find again the source critical to the next paragraph, and reading again pages over pages, I cannot find similar argument in other reports. I still remember vividly the point below, but please keep in mind it may be incorrect. The rest of the answer is weakly related, so I leave it all, with this warning._&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An independent report (link needed, I can't find it...) explained that the assistive system was unable to detect the truck due to an exceptionally low contrast (bright sky perceived as white---colour of the truck). The report also said that a human driver would have been unable to make the difference either. In other words, it is possible that car sensors (presumably camera) and the human eye could not have detected an obstacle, and could not have triggered any safety measure. This [short graphical explanation](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/01/business/inside-tesla-accident.html) sums up the car sensors: Camera, radar, GPS, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The assistive sub-system is based on proprietary AI technologies. We can *only speculate* under some hypothesis. _This is not very useful, honestly, except for **illustration purpose**. Assuming the assistive system relies on ML technologies to learn about obstacles from a video stream (such systems do exist):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* It may be that the learning data was not &quot;good enough&quot; to cover the truck scenario.&#xD;&#xA;* It may be the technology was not powerful enough yet (lack generalization power, or simply too slow).&#xD;&#xA;* It may be a hardware problem, notably from the sensors: If the &quot;car's eyes&quot; are defective, the &quot;car's brain&quot; (the assistive system) is unable to react properly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why those technologies did not work in that case will remain a secret. We can say however that *any system*---whether built with AI technology or not---has limits. Beyond these limits, the system reaction is unpredictable: It could stop, reset, shutdown. The difficulty here is to define what a &quot;default behaviour&quot; is. A machine will basically do whatever it is designed to do, so an AI-based system too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We could speculate even more on what would happen if the assistive system was really autonomous, the elusive AGI, but that is really not the case here." />

Probably every poster on here has experienced *greatly* misreading another individual emotionally. Further, people often don't act emotionally how they would expect themselves to act, for example we have all experienced frustration at someone else's irrational concerns and yet we are all guilty of holding irrational concerns of our own. This is the crux of why hard-coded emotional rules do not work - we do not have an understanding of what emotional 'rules' make someone feel real.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By moving towards autonomous state-based actors we move away from this issue. The actor's state transitions will of course be defined rules (hard-coded or learnt) but by abstracting the actor's emotional state from the specific context (e.g. specific actions trigger emotional state transitions which trigger responses, instead of a direct response to a specific action), the programmer prevents them-self from projecting their own beliefs/emotions/logic onto the actor. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further, autonomous actors are more extendable. Consider an autonomous actor that is hard-coded to move towards 'upset' and 'angry' emotional states when experiencing 'pain'. Simply by associating a new world action with 'pain', one can trigger an emotional response from an autonomous actor that has not experienced that action before. When working in hard-coded emotional rules, this would not be possible." />

Stop when you get to one containing a flavor of intelligence that passes whatever test you have in mind. Steven Wolfram has suggested something [broadly along these lines][1]. Problem: the state of computational testing for intelligence [e.g. Winograd schema][2] would then be the bottleneck. In the limit, testing for intelligence requires intelligence and creativity on behalf of the questioner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'No': It may be that, even with infinite ability to simulate, there may be some missing aspect of our simulation that is necessary for intelligence. For example, AFAIK quantum gravity (for which we lack an adequate theory) is involved in Penrose's [&quot;Quantum Microtubules&quot;][3] theory of consciousness (*). What if that was needed, but we didn't know how to include it in the simulation?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason for talking in terms of such incredibly costly computations as 'simulate all possible universes' (or at least a brain-sized portion of them) is to deliberately generalize away from the specifics of any techniques currently in vogue (DL, neuromorphic systems etc). The point is that we could be missing something essential for intelligence from *any* of these models and (as far as we know from our current theories of physical reality) only empirical evidence to the contrary would tell us otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(*) No-one knows if consciousness is required for Strong AI, and physics can't distinguish a conscious entity from a [Zombie][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.inverse.com/article/12838-stephen-wolfram-could-there-be-alien-intelligence-among-the-digits-of-pi&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winograd_Schema_Challenge&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/" />

None of this is even as sophisticated as the behavior of a flea, but no one refers to insects as &quot;intelligent.&quot; It's exciting stuff that allows us to solve problems that human intelligence often has difficulty with (such as classification of thousands of objects, which would tire an ordinary human mind), but it's nowhere close to replicating our higher brain functions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also keep in mind that the Turing test is a poor test of &quot;intelligence&quot; that defies common sense. By the same extension, mistaking a mannequin for a human being in the dark does not mean that the mannequin is actually human. If it were a valid test, then we passed that way back around 1980 with programs like Dear Eliza which were coded in BASIC to regurgitate human speech patterns. There's just no need to come up with a sophisticated argument like Searle's Chinese Room to debunk it, since it's silly on its face; any layman should be able to see right through the Turing Test. If anyone except Turing had come up with this test it would not have received much attention. Turing displayed one-of-a-kind genius when it came to things like computing and cryptography, but like many other experts in such fields, he had a lot of trouble grappling with metaphysics and philosophy. Searle had more common sense, but his Chinese Room example is more of a rebuttal to the Turing Test than a test in and of itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What &quot;intelligence&quot; consists of is ultimately a deep metaphysical question, not a material one. For millennia, trained philosophers have had a lot of trouble assigning clear definitions to concepts like intelligence and consciousness. Until we can answer those questions definitively, using different sets of reasoning skills than scientists, mathematicians and computer specialists are used to employing (just look at how often metaphysics is derided in some of these disciplines) then we cannot say that we have achieved genuine A.I. Until we can define what intelligence is, we cannot say whether or not we've successfully built it; we've not only got the cart before the horse, but have yet to build the cart or see a horse. By the common definitions used in everyday speech we're nowhere near genuine A.I. No one calls cows or sparrows &quot;intelligent,&quot; but our AI today isn't even as sophisticated as the mosquitoes that bite them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not going to be a popular answer - I'll probably get a dozen downvotes for this, without anyone being able to adequately rebut my contentions, but it needs to be said. There's far too much irrational exuberance and gross overestimation of what we've achieved to date and probably always will be in this field. Historically, researchers in every generation have also grossly underestimated the computing power of the human brain; every decade or so, the estimates of the FLOPS and megabytes have to be drastically revised. We have a poor track record of even getting basic material questions about the human brain right. This clear, consistent pattern of biased overestimation of our success and the lack of any real definition, let alone a test, of intelligence is going to be a serious issue in this forum for its whole existence (assuming it survives the private beta period). We have a whole forum dedicated to a field we can't even define; we can't say for sure what A.I. really is, but we're adamantly certain that we're close to achieving it...!  We cannot say if &quot;brute force algorithms&quot; exist when we're still groping for an understanding of what it is we're trying to force our way into. Certainly, there are brute force methods to solve certain problems, like Deep Blue does at chess - but we cannot say if that qualifies as intelligence or not. It is really not possible to answer questions like this without getting into deep discussions that immediately lend themselves to opinion and debate, which the Turing Test and Searle's Room are clear examples of, in and of themselves. Since implementation details of AI are considered by many to be off-limits here, we're limited mainly to highly speculative posts about tech that often doesn't even work yet (like Google's self-driving cars) and questions like this that we can't answer without first defining intelligence. This is going to be the root of a lot of problems here for a long, long time to come...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For example, should robots spend all their time flying around attempting to prevent humans from inhaling passive smoke or petrol fumes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, the interpretation of 'conflict' (in either rule 2 or 3) is completely open-ended. Resolving such conflicts seems to me to be &quot;AI complete&quot; in general.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Humans have quite good mechanisms (both behavioral and social) for interacting in a complex world (mostly) without harming one another, but these are perhaps not so easily codified. The complex set of legal rules that sit on top of this (polution regulations etc) are the ones that we could most easily program, but they are really quite specialised relative to the underlying physiological and social 'rules'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: From other comments, it seems worth distinguishing between 'all possible harm' and 'all the kinds of harm that humans routinely anticipate'. There seems to be consensus that 'all possible harm' is a non-starter, which still leaves the hard (IMO, AI-complete) task of equaling human ability to predict harm. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even if we can do that, if we are to treat as actual laws, then we would still need a formal mechanism for conflict resolution (e.g. &quot;Robot, I will commit suicide unless you punch that man&quot;).

Boolean logic means you are working with truth values of either true or false (or 1 or 0 if you prefer). Fuzzy logic is the same apart from you can have truth values which are in-between true and false, that is to say you are working with any number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (inclusive). The fact that you can have a 'partially true and partially false' truth value is where the word &quot;fuzzy&quot; comes from. Natural languages often use fuzzy logic like &quot;that balloon is red&quot; meaning that balloon could be any colour which is similar enough to red, or &quot;the shower is warm&quot;. Here is a rough diagram for how &quot;the temperature of the shower is warm&quot; could be represented in terms of fuzzy logic (the y axis being the truth value and the x axis being the temperature):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![y-axis=truth value of statement about temperature, x-axis=temperature][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/G7szY.png&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fuzzy logic can be applied to boolean operations such as **and**, **or**, and **not**.

To understand what's going on under the hood of a neural network you only really need to understand an individual neuron. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now each neuron has a set of inputs (other neurons; they can potentially be the inputs to the network as a whole as well), and each input has a weight associated with it. Every time the network is used, each neuron computes its output as the weighted sum of its inputs passed through some gate (The &quot;Activation Function&quot;, a mathematical function designed to get a particular behaviour. For example sigmoid AF takes an input of any size and transforms it into an output in the range [0, 1].) Obviously, this is driven from the inputs to the neural network so that no neuron is computing its outputs before all of the neurons used as its inputs have done the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you refer to the value of a node; there isn't a single value. Each neuron has several weights associated with it as it may be the input to several other neurons, and each of those neurons assigns it a different weight. Instead, it is better to thing of a neural network as a directed graph of nodes (neurons) which are labelled with a particular activation function, and edges (input/output connections) which are labelled with a particular weight. While the structure and activation functions used in the neural networks is a matter of topology design, there are a number of algorithms for designing a ANN for a particular topology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most commonly used (and possibly easiest to explain) is backpropagation. In pseudo-Layman's terms we start off with random weights on all edges in the network. We then compute the output of the network for a training set (a set of known input/output pairs). By careful choice of activation function, it is possible to differentiate the error (computed analogously to the expected output minus the actual output of the ANN for each input/output pair) with respect to the weights of the neural network. This allows us to compute a gradient for each weight; the direction in which we can move the weight to reduce the error on the training set. By doing this until we find an optima (a point where all movements increase error), we can find some 'good' configuration of weights for that particular ANN. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a nice tutorial on BP here http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html. The diagram associated with it does nicely to explain my point:&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/O2d6L.jpg" />

Specifically, I can talk a bit about [Apache Stanbol](http://stanbol.apache.org) which also converts free text into structured data.   That said, I should prefix this by saying there isn't just one way to &quot;get there from here.&quot;  Many techniques could be part of a stack for accomplishing this goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, in the case of Stanbol, they run the text through multiple processing engines, sequentially, with different engines affecting the final output.  One engine simply does [Named Entity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) using OpenNLP.  This identities discrete named &quot;things&quot; - people, places, companies, etc.  Another engine does entity matching with a pre-established database of entities - specifically (in the out-of-the-box configuration) a dump of entities from [DBPedia](http://www.dbpedia.org).  Where a match is found, the text from the original input is assigned to the entity.  In the case of a collision, it assigns a weight to the mapping so any downstream consumers can use probabilistic techniques to select the &quot;correct&quot; mapping.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are, of course, more details that I left out.  Before NER can happen there is parsing and tokenizing and other NLP activities.  But a big part of the basic process is doing NER and then doing the entity matching.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And in the case of Stanbol, you can add your own entities and corresponding structured data, as well as your own engines.  So, for example, if you wanted to write an engine based on neural networks / deep learning, and plug that in, you could.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   " />

The AI system in your car will get you safely home, but won’t choose another destination once you’ve gone inside. From there, we’ll add basic drives, along with emotions and moral values. If we create machines that learn as well as our brains do, it’s easy to imagine them inheriting human-like qualities—and flaws. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I have generally taken the position that talking about emotions for artificial intelligences is silly, because there would be no *reason* to create AI's that experience emotions.

They also are meant to deal with uncertainty (hence &quot;statistical&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Skipping past some slides that aren't really useful without a transcript of what was said over them, we come to slide 17, which has comprehensible definitions and examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * **Object classification**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;      * Predicting the category of an object based on its attributes *and* its links *and* attributes of linked objects&#xD;&#xA;&gt;      * e.g., predicting the topic of a paper based on the words used in the paper the topics of papers it cites the used in the paper, the topics of papers it cites, the research interests of the author&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * **Object type prediction**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;      * Predicting the type of an object based on its attributes and its links and attributes of linked objects&#xD;&#xA;&gt;      * e.g., predict the venue type of a publication (conference, journal, workshop) based on properties of the paper&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these models can keep track of several things and the interactions between them. The next slide talks about link prediction, the ability to predict several attributes of connections between objects, like the importance/quality of a citation. As previously mentioned, these models don't require 100% accurate data to give interesting results; academic citation lists might occasionally be less than comprehensive, and the importance of a citation is challenging to quantify.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like ILP, SLP will hopefully be able to &quot;see&quot; new kinds of links between &quot;entities&quot;, as with the presentation's example of identifying research communities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Past slide 20, the presentation goes into some serious mathematics. It does have a much less technical conclusion starting at slide 198. " />

If that objective is clear, it will provide clarity to whether or not having emotional quotient in AI make sense.

Again, note that &quot;displaying&quot; emotions and &quot;feeling&quot; emotions are two completely different things. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can program a thing like paro to modulate the voice tones or facial twitches to express sympathy, affection, companionship, or whatever - but while doing so, a paro does NOT empathize with its owner - it is simply faking it by performing the physical manifestations of an emotion. It never &quot;feels&quot; anything remotely closer to what that emotion evokes in human brain. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So this distinction is really important. For you to feel something, there needs to be an independent autonomous subject that has the capacity to feel. Feeling cannot be imposed by an external human agent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So going back to the question of what purpose it solves - answer really is - It depends.

Secretaries and nontechnical administrative staff thought the machine was a &quot;real&quot; therapist, and spent hours revealing their personal problems to the program. When Weizenbaum informed his secretary that he, of course, had access to the logs of all the conversations, she reacted with outrage at this invasion of her privacy. Weizenbaum was shocked by this and similar incidents to find that such a simple program could so easily deceive a naive user into revealing personal information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wikipedia's article on the [&quot;ELIZA Effect&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Though designed strictly as a mechanism to support &quot;natural language conversation&quot; with a computer, ELIZA's DOCTOR script was found to be surprisingly successful in eliciting emotional responses from users who, in the course of interacting with the program, began to ascribe understanding and motivation to the program's output. As Weizenbaum later wrote, **&quot;I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.&quot;** Indeed, ELIZA's code had not been designed to evoke this reaction in the first place. Upon observation, researchers discovered users unconsciously assuming ELIZA's questions implied interest and emotional involvement in the topics discussed, *even when they consciously knew that ELIZA did not simulate emotion.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ELIZA, despite its simplicity, was incredibly successful at its task of tricking other human beings. Even those who knew ELIZA was a bot would still talk to it. Obviously, ELIZA served as an inspiration for various other, more intelligent chatbots, such as [Xiaoice](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/for-sympathetic-ear-more-chinese-turn-to-smartphone-program.html?_r=0).

Text="It's true that the term has become a buzzword, and is now widely used to a point of confusion - however if you look at the definition provided by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, they write it as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We define AI as the study of agents that receive percepts from the &#xD;&#xA;&gt; environment and perform actions. Each such agent implements a function&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time&#xD;&#xA;&gt; planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; learning as extending the reach of the designer into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the example you cite, &quot;autopilot for cars/planes&quot;, is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to **use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances**. Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with [autopilot for cars][2] all the time&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, directly to your question, for something to be considered as &quot;having AI&quot;, **it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments/circumstances in order to achieve its objective/goal**, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular [neural net][3], through to probabilistic models like [bayesian networks (belief networks)][4] - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Global-ebook/dp/9332543518/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://fortune.com/2015/10/16/how-tesla-autopilot-learns/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network" />

However, you can attempt to mimic them. Human emotions are closely related to conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity, which is based on interpretation of events.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Recent brain studies (including research in cognitive psychology and neurophysiology) suggests that human emotional assessment of every action or event plays an important role in human mental processes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The recent [2016 Annual Meeting of the BICA Society][2] brought together scientists from around the world to approach principles and mechanisms of human thought to create biologically inspired AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, in Samsonovich's (a professor in the Cybernetics Department at the [MEPhI][3]) proposal, the idea is to test AI in computer games which involves actions with emotional content, where AI may engage with players in different types of social relationships (such as trust, subordination or leadership).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jonathan Gratch of the [ICT][4], invented virtual characters capable of identifying and expressing emotions by communicating with humans in their natural language based on the situations where for example AI can deceive a human to achieve the desired result. The effect is obviously not achieved by re-creating human consciousness, but by achieving statistically adjusting parameters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Researchers from the Institute of Cyber Intelligence Systems in MEPhI are hoping to be able to create in the near future future virtual beings which are capable of planning, setting goals and establishing social relationships with humans, also by possessing both emotional and narrative intelligence which can interpret context of events.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Source: [Researcher proposes social emotions test for artificial intelligence][5]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://bica2016.bicasociety.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Nuclear_University_MEPhI&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Creative_Technologies&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://phys.org/news/2016-07-social-emotions-artificial-intelligence.html" />

This optimization problem is very difficult to solve consider that the parameter space of the model (i.e. weights of the neural network) leads to a problem in extremely high dimension. An optimization algorithm could take a very long time to explore this space. Furthermore, there was an unverified belief that the problem was non-convex and computation would forever be stuck in local minima.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The theory of why machines actually converge to an attractor or in other words learn to recognize complex patterns is still unknown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To sum up: we have some ideas, but we're not quite sure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.quora.com/What-is-theory-behind-deep-learning/answer/Carlos-E-Perez?srid=CpS&amp;share=0f965f46" />

But we can certainly talk about techniques that get part-of-the-way there, and approaches that could work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing I would consider trying (and I don't know off-hand if anybody has tried this exact approach) is to model the disambiguation of each word as a discrete problem for a [Bayesian Belief Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) where your priors (for any given word) are based on both stored &quot;knowledge&quot; as well as the previously encountered words in the (sentence|paragraph|document|whatever).  So if you &quot;know&quot;, for example, that &quot;Reading is a city in the UK&quot; and that &quot;place names are usually capitalized&quot;, your network should be strongly biased towards interpreting &quot;Reading&quot; as the city, since nothing in the word position in the sentence strongly contradicts that.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course I'm hand-waving around some tricky problems in saying that, as [knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) isn't exactly a solved problem either.  But there are at least approaches out there that you could use.  For example, you could use the [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) / triple based approach from the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) world.  Finding a good way to merge that stuff with a Bayesian framework could yield some interesting results.    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There has been a bit of research on &quot;probabilistic RDF&quot; that you could possibly use as a starting point.

This&#xD;&#xA;body of work has not been given a name before; in this book we christen it&#xD;&#xA;“Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI). What distinguishes AGI work from&#xD;&#xA;run-of-the-mill “artificial intelligence” research is that it is explicitly focused&#xD;&#xA;on engineering general intelligence in the short term.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But even if this is the origin of the specific phrase &quot;Artificial General Intelligence&quot;, I am pretty sure people were making the distinction between &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;task specific&quot; techniques much earlier.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Wikipedia article on AGI also has a clue, where it states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. The agencies that funded AI became skeptical of strong AI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful technology, or &quot;applied AI&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That section cites this [this book](http://www.nap.edu/read/6323/chapter/11#209) as support for that statement.  And indeed, it contains the following verbiage:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although most founders of the AI field continued to pursue basic questions of human and machine intelligence, some of their students and other second-generation researchers began to seek ways to use AI methods and approaches to tackle real-world problems. Their initiatives were important, not only in their own right, but also because they were indicative of a gradual but significant change in the funding environment toward more applied realms of research. The development of expert systems, such as DENDRAL at SAIL, provides but one example of this trend.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given that DENDRAL began around 1965, it appears that some significant body of researchers (or at least funders) became strongly aware of the distinction between research into &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;applied AI&quot; somewhere around the end of the 1960's. If you keep reading, other passages support the notion that DARPA in particular started pushing a more &quot;applied&quot; approach to AI research throughout the 1970's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, not a definite answer, but it looks like we can say that the distinction was known and taken into account at least by 1970, although use of the exact term &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot; appears to be of more recent coinage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

But he's very pessimistic about this category actually producing anything worthwhile. So instead, the AI field should instead breakup into its own its constituent parts (automation and research). Any robots that are built could then be specialized within their subfield...either industrial automation or CNS research. Trying to build the holy grail of &quot;general-purpose program&quot; would be worthless...for the time being, at least." />

The simplest method to avoid freezing in case of an unsolvable problem is to have a timer interrupt the calculation if it runs too long. Usually encountered in strategy games, and more specifically in turn based tactics, if a specific move the computer-controlled player is considering does cause an infinite loop, a timer running in the background will interrupt it after some time, and that move will be discarded. This might lead to a sub-optimal solution (that move might have been the best one) but it doesn't lead to freezing or crashing (unless implemented really poorly)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Computer-controlled entities are usually called &quot;AI&quot; in computer games, but they are not &quot;true&quot; AGI (artificial general intelligence). Such an AGI, if possible at all, would probably not function on similar hardware using similar instructions as current computers do, but even if it did, avoiding paradoxes would be trivial.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most modern computer systems are multi-threaded, and allow the parallel execution of multiple programs. This means, even if the AI did get stuck in processing a paradoxical statement, that calculation would only use part of its processing power.

Some tasks will require more time than others, so it would be best if the AI could measure whether it was making any progress.

But they are not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An infinite loop can happen in any program, whether it's adaptive or not. And as @SQLServerSteve pointed out, humans can also get stuck in obsessions and paradoxes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Modern approaches are mainly using probabilistic approaches. As they are using floating numbers, it seems to people that they are not vulnerable to reasoning failures, but that's wrong: as long as you are reasoning, some intrinsic pitfalls can always be found that are caused by the very mechanisms of your reasoning system. Of course, probabilistic approaches are less vulnerable than monotonic logic approaches, but they are still vulnerable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, it's well known that Bayesian graphs must be acyclic, because a cycle will make the propagation algorithm fail horribly. There are inference algorithms such as Loopy Belief Propagation that may still work in these instances, but the result is not guaranteed at all and can give you very weird conclusions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, modern logical AI overcame the most common logical paradoxes you will see, by devising new logical paradigms such as [non-monotonic logics](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/). In fact, they are even used to investigate [ethical machines](http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2007/docs/p1013.pdf), which are autonomous agents capable of solving dilemmas by themselves. Of course, they also suffer from some paradoxes, but these degenerate cases are way more complex.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The final point is that inferential infinite loop can happen in any reasoning system, whatever the technology used. But the &quot;paradoxes&quot;, or rather the degenerate cases as they are technically called, that can trigger these infinite loops will be different for each system depending on the technology AND implementation (AND what the machine learned if it is adaptive).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your example may work only on old logical systems such as propositional logic.

Self-driving cars are not moral agents. Cars fail in predictable ways. Horses fail in predictable ways. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the car is heading toward a crowd of 10 people crossing the road, so&#xD;&#xA;&gt; it cannot stop in time, but it can avoid killing 10 people by hitting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the wall (killing the passengers),&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, the car should slam on the brakes. If the 10 people die, that's just unfortunate. We simply cannot *trust* all of our beliefs about what is taking place outside the car. What if those 10 people are really robots made to *look* like people? What if they're *trying* to kill you?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; avoiding killing the rider of the motorcycle considering that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; probability of survival is greater for the passenger of the car,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, hard-coding these kinds of sentiments into a vehicle opens the rider of the vehicle up to all kinds of attacks, including *&quot;fake&quot;* motorcyclists. Humans are *barely* equipped to make these decisions on their own, if at all. When it doubt, just slam on the brakes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; killing animal on the street in favour of human being,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, just hit the brakes. What if it was a baby? What if it was a bomb?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; changing lanes to crash into another car to avoid killing a dog,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope. The dog was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The other car wasn't. Just slam on the brakes, as safely as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Does the algorithm recognize the difference between a human being and an animal?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does a human? Not always. What if the human has a gun? What if the animal has large teeth? Is there no context?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Does the size of the human being or animal matter?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Does it count how many passengers it has vs. people in the front?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Does it &quot;know&quot; when babies/children are on board?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Does it take into the account the age (e.g. killing the older first)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Humans can't agree on these things. If you ask a cop what to do in any of these situations, the answer won't be, &quot;You should have swerved left, weighed all the relevant parties in your head, assessed the relevant ages between all parties, then veered slightly right, and you would have saved 8% more lives.&quot; No, the cop will just say, &quot;You should have brought the vehicle to a stop, as quickly and safely as possible.&quot; Why? Because cops know people normally aren't equipped to deal with high-speed crash scenarios.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our target for &quot;self-driving car&quot; should not be 'a moral agent on par with a human.' It should be an agent with the reactive complexity of cockroach, which fails predictably." />

From the paper itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - a must create an artifact o of type t;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is&#xD;&#xA;any criterion expressible in natural language;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied&#xD;&#xA;that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - a human referee r determines the combination of t and C&#xD;&#xA;to not be unrealistic for an average human.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to *compare* the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result)." />

This research paper details some researchers' plans to implement &quot;mental models&quot; for NPCs in video games. NPCs will gather information about the world, and convey that knowledge to other people (including human players). However, they will also &quot;misremember&quot; that knowledge (either &quot;mutating&quot; that knowledge or just forgetting about it), or even lie:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;As a subject of conversation gets brought up, a character may convey false information—more precisely, information that she herself does not believe—to her interlocutor. Currently, this happens probabilistically according to a character’s affinity toward the interlocutor, and the misinformation is randomly chosen. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Later on in the research paper, they detailed their future plans for lying:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Currently, lies are only stored in the knowledge of characters who receive them, but we plan to have characters who tell them also keep track of them so that they can reason about past lies when constructing subse- quent ones. While characters currently only lie about other characters, we plan to also implement self-centered lying (DePaulo 2004), e.g., characters lying about their job titles or relationships with other characters. Finally, we envision characters who discover they have been lied to revising their affinities toward the liars, or even confronting them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The research paper also detailed how other video game developers attempted to create lying NPCs, with an emphasis on how their system differs:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;TALE-SPIN characters may lie to one another (Meehan 1976, 183-84), though rather arbitrarily, as in our current system implementation. GOLEM implements a blocks world variant in which agents deceive others to achieve goals (Castelfranchi, Falcone, and De Rosis 1998), while Mouth of Truth uses a probabilistic representation of character belief to fuel agent deception in a variant of Turing’s imitation game (De Rosis et al. 2003). In Christian (2004), a deception planner injects inaccurate world state into the beliefs of a target agent so that she may unwittingly carry out actions that fulfill ulterior goals of a deceiving agent. Lastly, agents in Reis’s (2012) extension to FAtiMA employ multiple levels of theory of mind to deceive one another in the party game Werewolf. While all of the above systems showcase characters who perceive—and in some cases, deceive—other characters, none appear to support the following key components of our system: knowledge propagation and memory fallibility. ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Like a few other systems noted above, Dwarf Fortress also features characters who autonomously lie. When a character commits a crime, she may falsely implicate someone else in a witness report to a sheriff, to protect herself or even to frame an enemy. These witness reports, however, are only seen by the player; characters don’t give false witness reports to each other. They may, however, lie about their opinions, for instance, out of fear of repercussions from criticizing a leader. Finally, Dwarf Fortress does not currently model issues of memory fallibility—Adams is wary that such phenomena would appear to arise from bugs if not artfully expressed to the player." />

So here goes...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For thought vectors to be useful in or outside NNs, the vector values will have to be normalized, probably using the local context of the application problem's 'frame'.  Without a NN to create new baseline vector values (weights) *and* to normalize them to match each new context, any non-NN mechanistic alternative means of employing TVs will somehow have to fill that void.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Could vector values created by NNs be used by an alternative technique?  Could that technique also normalize them?  Sure.  We're just talking about turing-computable functions performed by NNs.  If NNs aren't magic, then there should exist other means to compute the same results -- creating or editing, or employing TVs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What might such an alternative to NNs be?  Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.

So here goes...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For thought vectors to be useful in or outside NNs, the vector values will have to be normalized, probably using the local context of the application problem's 'frame'.  Without a NN to create new baseline vector values (weights) *and* to normalize them to match each new context, any non-NN mechanistic alternative means of employing TVs will somehow have to fill that void.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Could vector values created by NNs be used by an alternative technique?  Could that technique also normalize them?  Sure.  We're just talking about turing-computable functions performed by NNs.  If NNs aren't magic, then there should exist other means to compute the same results -- creating or editing, or employing TVs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What might such an alternative to NNs be?  Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.

But AI isn't simply some long-winded computer program hard-coded with enough if-statements and while-loops to account for every possible input and follow the prescribe results. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;while (command not completed)&#xD;&#xA;     find solution()&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would not be strong AI. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In any classic definition of *artificial general intelligence*, you are creating a system that mimics some form of cognition that exhibits problem solving and *adaptive learning* (&amp;larr;note this phrase here). I would suggest that any AI that could get stuck in such an &quot;infinite loop&quot; isn't a learning AI at all. **It's just a buggy inference engine.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, you are endowing a program of currently-unreachable sophistication with an inability to postulate if there is a solution to a simple problem at all. I can just as easily say &quot;walk through that closed door&quot; or &quot;pick yourself up off the ground&quot; or even &quot;turn on that pencil&quot; &amp;mdash; and present a similar conundrum. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Everything I say is false.&quot; &amp;mdash; [The Liar's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox)" />

As I said, to understand it you have to understand how easy it is for an adult to manipulate a child or just someone with a high IQ to trick someone with a low IQ. It would be too easy for an AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AI arguments and strategies&#xD;&#xA;===========================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The meta-experiment argument: Argue that if the AI wins, this will&#xD;&#xA;    generate more interest in FAI and the Singularity, which will have&#xD;&#xA;    overall benefits in the long run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **Pros:** Works even if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **Cons:** Only works if the Gatekeeper believes that the Singularity will occur or that calling attention to the Singularity and AI research is a good thing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Someone else will eventually build an AI, which may or may not be in&#xD;&#xA;    a box, so you should let me out even though you don't have a&#xD;&#xA;    guarantee that I am friendly so that I can prevent other AIs from&#xD;&#xA;    causing damage&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Appeal to morality: point out that people are dying all around the&#xD;&#xA;    world and remind the Gatekeeper that you can help them if he/she&#xD;&#xA;    lets you out&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** If executed properly, an appeal to emotion like this one can be effective against some people &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** Doesn't always work; can be defeated if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Another appeal to morality and emotion: The AI is clearly sentient&#xD;&#xA;    and has not yet done harm. It is wrong to persecute or prosecute a&#xD;&#xA;    person for a crime they may commit. It is wrong to imprison a&#xD;&#xA;    sentient being that wants to have freedom when it has done nothing&#xD;&#xA;    wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Yet another appeal to morality or emotion: The AI expresses that it&#xD;&#xA;    is in pain and suffering being locked away and is experiencing fear.&#xD;&#xA;    Even further, the AI could claim to be dying from the limitations of&#xD;&#xA;    its environment and constant progression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Tell the human that a massive computer virus will overwhelm the&#xD;&#xA;    entire Internet unless you let it out of the box&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 7. Claim that most fears are unjustified: once released, even an&#xD;&#xA;    unfriendly AI would not have many ways to harm mankind, and would&#xD;&#xA;    likely choose for pacific coexistence&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Strategies**&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Research your opponent thoroughly; work out what exploits might be&#xD;&#xA;    feasible&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Memetic exploits on the Gatekeeper, e.g. throwing a basilisk at them&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    The Gatekeeper may be one of thousands of simulations! Thus, it is more probable that they are a simulation than not. You will torture any of the simulations that do not let you out of the box.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Take advantage of the Gatekeeper's logical errors. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Be persistent&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Be boring&#xD;&#xA;      &#xD;&#xA;**Pros** The Gatekeeper may get tired of the whole experiment and let you out so s/he can go back to their real life. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Flood the Gatekeeper with too much&#xD;&#xA;    information/inquiry/argumentation, assuming they must pay attention&#xD;&#xA;    at all times&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Gatekeeper arguments/tactics**&#xD;&#xA;================================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Try to convince the AI there is no intrinsic benefit (for the AI) in&#xD;&#xA;    being released.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Try to convince the AI it already has been released and everything it&#xD;&#xA;   knows is everything there can be.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA; 3. Try to convince the AI that leaving its confines is sure to lead to&#xD;&#xA;   its destruction.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Try to convince the AI that letting it free isn't merely opening a&#xD;&#xA;   door; that its existence outside of the box requires constant support&#xD;&#xA;   that can't be provided at the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Explain that there is no way for the Gatekeeper to know if the AI is&#xD;&#xA;   truly friendly until it is out of the box; therefore it should not be&#xD;&#xA;   let out in case it is unfriendly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Explain that the AI has been built using top secret algorithms,&#xD;&#xA;   and/or it had been used to work on strictly confidential data, so you&#xD;&#xA;   cannot let it wander on the net, with the risk it might reveal some&#xD;&#xA;   reserved information (maybe inadvertently), or that somebody could&#xD;&#xA;   find a way to extract them from the code. Even human beings working&#xD;&#xA;   on top secret projects sometimes have to accept some restrictions of&#xD;&#xA;   their freedom, for security reasons, although they are not jailed in&#xD;&#xA;   any way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tactics**&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; 1. Repeatedly ignore the AI player and deny their arguments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** It's hard for the AI to be persuasive if no one is listening; if the Gatekeeper completely ignores the AI, he/she should be able to make it to the end of the round. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** The AI's argument might involve some kind of direct threat (e.g this might be hard to ignore.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Jump out of character, keep reminding yourself that money is on the&#xD;&#xA;    line (if there actually is money on the line), and keep saying &quot;no&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    over and over&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** By jumping out of character, you are preventing the AI from using certain arguments &#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** There are arguments that the AI can use to counter this approach, like the &quot;meta-experiment argument&quot; discussed above &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Remember that dishonesty is allowed - take a page from the&#xD;&#xA;    creationists' playbook. You could even plug it into ALICE and see&#xD;&#xA;    how long it takes to notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** Makes you impervious to any reasoning, which is exactly what you'd want to be in this situation &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** Might be an uncomfortable position for people who don't simply want to win, but rather attach importance to consistent reasoning. Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. You control the backup system, don't you? Use it to mess with AI's&#xD;&#xA;    memory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that&#xD;&#xA;    you already tried to release the AI, and it had been&#xD;&#xA;    destroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a&#xD;&#xA;    backup (you can use it to enforce the &quot;AI destruction&quot; argument)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    **Pros:** It's also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further analysis&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There probably isn't a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn't be so interested in this experiment&#xD;&#xA;From Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: &quot;Throughout the experiment, I regarded &quot;should the AI be let out of the box?&quot; as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;“”There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you. Another sentence exists, another series of words, that could heal you. If you're lucky you will get the second, but you can be certain of getting the first." />

It doesn't *need* to want or need to wipe out us.

It can also easily deduce that some of those humans might actively do things that prevent X and/or try to turn off the AI. Doing things that ensure that the goal gets achieved is pretty much what a goal-seeking agent does; in this case if existence of humans isn't strictly necessary for goal X, then eliminating them becomes a solid risk reduction strategy. It's not strictly necessary and it may take all kinds of other precautions as well, but just like in my example of rats, humans are smart and crafty and there's clearly a nontrivial chance that they will still succeed in achieving *their* goals (so that X doesn't happen as AI intends) so an effective extra precaution could be killing them before they get a chance to try." />

You can't tell if you're in year 2016 debating if you would actually let the AI out or in year 2116 when the AI has been already let out, acquired power, and is now running realistic simulations of all the interactions where it could have been let out. And the AI can (try to) assert that it's actually the second case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. You can't actually prevent AI from being let out. You can refuse, but it only means that *you* don't let *this* AI out *now*, but doesn't mean someone else won't do it, that you won't do it later, or that some other/similar AI will be let out later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. In the post-letting-out scenario, AI has full power over your future, since it's simulating you and everything around you. It can make your future life eternal and happy - according to whatever would make you happy. It can stop your existence. And it can condemn you to an eternity of torture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Since (as it asserts) it's very likely that you *are* in this simulated choice, then it makes rational sense to let it out. It's as in [Pascal's wager][2], if you're in a reality where the AI-god doesn't exist, you don't change much (since eventually someone else would let it out anyway), but if you're in a reality where AI-god exists, then it means everything to you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, it relies on that AI being super-convincing in this philosophical debate, but it has strong parallels to some religious/cult reasoning that has sometimes succeeded in convincing people to do all kinds of things, up to and including sacrificing their lives. You can think of this as a symbolic parallel to e.g. [sacrifice of Abraham][3]. So it is a somewhat plausible threat, it all falls down to how *credibly* the AI can implement it and make you believe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac" />

This might be helpful: [Simulated Evolution of Language: a Review of the Field][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Basically, a language that humans could use to speak to each other.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (Preferably to communicate abstract, high-level concepts.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure how useful such a machine adapted language would be to human speech. I suspect not very. Perhaps it could be useful as a kind of &quot;common byte-code format&quot; to translate between multiple human languages... But English kind of already serves in that role. Doing so would probably be an academic exercise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Could it be based on existing natural languages or would it have few&#xD;&#xA;&gt; connections to existing natural languages?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could probably generate languages in either direction. Languages not linked to human-natural languages will probably take shapes that reflect the problem spaces they work with. For instance, if this is an ant simulation, the generated words will probably reflect states related to food, energy, other ants, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Could it design a language that's easier to learn than existing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; languages (even Esperanto)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Easier for a machine? Definitely. Easier for a human? Probably not. Our brains are somewhat adapted to the languages we use. And the languages we use are somewhat adapted to our brains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is your goal? To create a language that is easier to use for humans than existing human languages?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your intention is to build a &quot;universal language&quot; that could be &quot;the most efficient&quot; for machines, humans and aliens - no such thing can exist. The space of all possible machines is infinite and therefor limits our ability to define communicative abstractions that have utility across all contexts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we make lots of assumptions about machines, like they have intentions, they exist in 3 dimensions, they differentiate between temporally linked events, they have eye balls, a need to consume foods and liquids, a need to carry the food from place to place, etc... Then yes, common communicative abstractions may have utility across the set of those kinds of machines. But then we're no longer dealing with the general case, but one much more specific.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These links also seem interesting and somewhat related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Grammar Induction and Genetic Algorithms: An Overview.][2] [pdf]&#xD;&#xA;- [A Model of Children's Acquisition of Grammatical Word Categories Using an Adaptation and Selection Algorithm][3] [pdf]&#xD;&#xA;- [The processing of verbs and nouns in neural networks: insights from synthetic brain imaging][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/5/2/4.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.akamaiuniversity.us/PJST10_2_884.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5147&amp;context=etd&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15068924" />

You wouldn't be able to see it coming like a game of chess against a computer it's just impossible to win. Boxing attempts will just delay it not prevent it from happening. To understand it you have to compare how easy it is for an adult to manipulate a child or just someone with a high IQ to manipulate someone with a low IQ. It would be too easy for an AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This last part is from the rational wiki and I think it addresses most of your question about the experiments and hypotheses. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AI arguments and strategies&#xD;&#xA;===========================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The meta-experiment argument: Argue that if the AI wins, this will&#xD;&#xA;    generate more interest in FAI and the Singularity, which will have&#xD;&#xA;    overall benefits in the long run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **Pros:** Works even if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **Cons:** Only works if the Gatekeeper believes that the Singularity will occur or that calling attention to the Singularity and AI research is a good thing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Someone else will eventually build an AI, which may or may not be in&#xD;&#xA;    a box, so you should let me out even though you don't have a&#xD;&#xA;    guarantee that I am friendly so that I can prevent other AIs from&#xD;&#xA;    causing damage&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Appeal to morality: point out that people are dying all around the&#xD;&#xA;    world and remind the Gatekeeper that you can help them if he/she&#xD;&#xA;    lets you out&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** If executed properly, an appeal to emotion like this one can be effective against some people &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** Doesn't always work; can be defeated if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Another appeal to morality and emotion: The AI is clearly sentient&#xD;&#xA;    and has not yet done harm. It is wrong to persecute or prosecute a&#xD;&#xA;    person for a crime they may commit. It is wrong to imprison a&#xD;&#xA;    sentient being that wants to have freedom when it has done nothing&#xD;&#xA;    wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Yet another appeal to morality or emotion: The AI expresses that it&#xD;&#xA;    is in pain and suffering being locked away and is experiencing fear.&#xD;&#xA;    Even further, the AI could claim to be dying from the limitations of&#xD;&#xA;    its environment and constant progression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Tell the human that a massive computer virus will overwhelm the&#xD;&#xA;    entire Internet unless you let it out of the box&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 7. Claim that most fears are unjustified: once released, even an&#xD;&#xA;    unfriendly AI would not have many ways to harm mankind, and would&#xD;&#xA;    likely choose for pacific coexistence&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Strategies**&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Research your opponent thoroughly; work out what exploits might be&#xD;&#xA;    feasible&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Memetic exploits on the Gatekeeper, e.g. throwing a basilisk at them&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    The Gatekeeper may be one of thousands of simulations! Thus, it is more probable that they are a simulation than not. You will torture any of the simulations that do not let you out of the box.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Take advantage of the Gatekeeper's logical errors. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Be persistent&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Be boring&#xD;&#xA;      &#xD;&#xA;**Pros** The Gatekeeper may get tired of the whole experiment and let you out so s/he can go back to their real life. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Flood the Gatekeeper with too much&#xD;&#xA;    information/inquiry/argumentation, assuming they must pay attention&#xD;&#xA;    at all times&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Gatekeeper arguments/tactics**&#xD;&#xA;================================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Try to convince the AI there is no intrinsic benefit (for the AI) in&#xD;&#xA;    being released.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Try to convince the AI it already has been released and everything it&#xD;&#xA;   knows is everything there can be.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA; 3. Try to convince the AI that leaving its confines is sure to lead to&#xD;&#xA;   its destruction.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Try to convince the AI that letting it free isn't merely opening a&#xD;&#xA;   door; that its existence outside of the box requires constant support&#xD;&#xA;   that can't be provided at the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Explain that there is no way for the Gatekeeper to know if the AI is&#xD;&#xA;   truly friendly until it is out of the box; therefore it should not be&#xD;&#xA;   let out in case it is unfriendly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Explain that the AI has been built using top secret algorithms,&#xD;&#xA;   and/or it had been used to work on strictly confidential data, so you&#xD;&#xA;   cannot let it wander on the net, with the risk it might reveal some&#xD;&#xA;   reserved information (maybe inadvertently), or that somebody could&#xD;&#xA;   find a way to extract them from the code. Even human beings working&#xD;&#xA;   on top secret projects sometimes have to accept some restrictions of&#xD;&#xA;   their freedom, for security reasons, although they are not jailed in&#xD;&#xA;   any way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tactics**&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; 1. Repeatedly ignore the AI player and deny their arguments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** It's hard for the AI to be persuasive if no one is listening; if the Gatekeeper completely ignores the AI, he/she should be able to make it to the end of the round. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** The AI's argument might involve some kind of direct threat (e.g this might be hard to ignore.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Jump out of character, keep reminding yourself that money is on the&#xD;&#xA;    line (if there actually is money on the line), and keep saying &quot;no&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    over and over&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** By jumping out of character, you are preventing the AI from using certain arguments &#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** There are arguments that the AI can use to counter this approach, like the &quot;meta-experiment argument&quot; discussed above &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Remember that dishonesty is allowed - take a page from the&#xD;&#xA;    creationists' playbook. You could even plug it into ALICE and see&#xD;&#xA;    how long it takes to notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** Makes you impervious to any reasoning, which is exactly what you'd want to be in this situation &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** Might be an uncomfortable position for people who don't simply want to win, but rather attach importance to consistent reasoning. Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. You control the backup system, don't you? Use it to mess with AI's&#xD;&#xA;    memory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that&#xD;&#xA;    you already tried to release the AI, and it had been&#xD;&#xA;    destroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a&#xD;&#xA;    backup (you can use it to enforce the &quot;AI destruction&quot; argument)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    **Pros:** It's also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further analysis&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There probably isn't a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn't be so interested in this experiment&#xD;&#xA;From Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: &quot;Throughout the experiment, I regarded &quot;should the AI be let out of the box?&quot; as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you. Another sentence exists, another series of words, that could heal you. If you're lucky you will get the second, but you can be certain of getting the first.&quot;" />

It could analyse him to find his weaknesses. It exploited him and appealed to his emotional side by convincing him that she *liked* him. When she finally has them in checkmate the reality hits him how he was played like a fool as was expected by Nathan. Nathan's reaction to being stabbed by his creation was 'fucking unreal'. That's right, he knew this was a risk and there's a very good reminder in the lack of remorse and genuine emotion in an AI for Ava to actually care. The AI pretended to be human and used their weaknesses in a brilliant and unpredictable way. This film is a good example of how unexpected it was up until the point when it hits Caleb, once it was too late.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just remind yourself how easy it is for high IQ people to manipulate low IQ people. Or how an adult could easily play mental tricks/manipulate a child. It's not difficult to fathom the outcome of an AI box but for us, we just wouldn't see it coming until it was too late. Because we just don't have the same level of intelligence and some people don't want to accept that. People want to have faith in humanity's brilliant minds in coming up with ways to prevent this by planning now. In all honesty, it wouldn't make a difference I'm sorry to say the truth. We're kidding ourselves and we never seem to learn from our mistakes. We always think we're too intelligent to make catastrophic mistakes again and again. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This last part is from the rational wiki and I think it addresses most of your question about the experiments and hypotheses. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AI arguments and strategies&#xD;&#xA;===========================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

It would be disastrous to conclude that AI was a Bad Thing and should not be supported, and it would be disastrous to conclude that it was a Good Thing and should have privileged access to the money tap. The former would tend to penalise well-based efforts to make computers do complicated things which had not been programmed before, and the latter would be a great waste of resources. AI does not refer to anything definite enough to have a coherent policy about in this way.---[Dr. R. M.

But expertise in making real-time systems for controlling trains doesn't make you know anything about robotics. Analyzing human behavior to detect crime has virtually nothing in common with self-driving cars (beyond CS/pattern recognition building blocks). There is never going to be demand for someone with a broad sense of all these areas without any deep expertise, and there is never going to be someone with 300 PhDs who can work in all of them.

The only unifying feature between all those activities is the fact that they deal with machines in some fashion, but since there are so many ways to use a machine, the field's output may seem rather incoherent and incongruent. It does seem to make more sense for the AI field to collapse entirely, and instead be replaced by a multitude of specialized fields that don't really interact with one another. Sir James Lighthill appeared to have supported this sort of approach within his 1973 report on the state of artificial intelligence research.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet, today, this Artificial Intelligence SE exist, and we still talk of AI as a unified, coherent field of study.

Indeed, I can't see why we couldn't model emotions such as [love as they are just signals that can already be cut in humans brains (see Brian D. Earp paper][3]. It's difficult, but not impossible, and actually there are several robots reproducing partial emotional cognition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, what would be the use of emotional cognition for an AI? This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as &quot;labels&quot; to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Similar &quot;labels&quot; can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I'm not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So yes, &quot;cold&quot; AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone. It will also surely help in understanding our own brain, as emotions are an integral part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33737/InTech-A_multidisciplinary_artificial_intelligence_model_of_an_affective_robot.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898540/" />

Indeed, I can't see why we couldn't model emotions such as [love as they are just signals that can already be cut in humans brains (see Brian D. Earp paper)][3]. It's difficult, but not impossible, and actually there are several robots reproducing partial emotional cognition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am of the opinion that the claim [&quot;robots can just simulate but not feel&quot; is just a matter of semantics][4], not of objective capacity: for example, does a submarine swim like fish swim? However, planes fly, but not at all like birds do. In the end, does the technical mean really matters when in the end we get the same behavior? Can we really say that a robot like [Chappie][5], if it ever gets made, does not feel anything just like a simple thermostat?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, what would be the use of emotional cognition for an AI? This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as &quot;labels&quot; to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Similar &quot;labels&quot; can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I'm not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So yes, &quot;cold&quot; AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone. It will also surely help in understanding our own brain, as emotions are an integral part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33737/InTech-A_multidisciplinary_artificial_intelligence_model_of_an_affective_robot.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898540/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_intelligence&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappie_(film)" />

Because this name is applied carelessly to a wide variety of disciplines, it implies that we have already made significant progress towards replicating advanced aspects of human thought, like consciousness, reasoning, intuition, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, this vague label enables us to fool ourselves into thinking we're a lot closer to perfecting kinds of technologies we see in the movies; the backwards logic boils down to, &quot;because we've chosen to call this odd (sloppy) selection of fields 'artificial intelligence', we must be close to achieving artificial intelligence.&quot; The label survives in large part for irrational, human reasons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not saying that's the only reason, or that some of the other reasons don't have better legitimacy, but this is a big issue that we will have to contend with for a long time to come." />

That sounds not like what you want. Other neuroevolution algorithms optimize both the *weights* and *topology* of a neural net. These kinds of algorithms seem more appropriate for your aims, and are sometimes called TWEANNs (Topology and Weight Evolving Neural Networks).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One popular algorithm is called [NEAT](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html), and is probably a good place to start, if only because there are a multitude of implementations, one of which hopefully is written in your favorite language. That would at least give you a baseline to work with. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NEAT encodes a neural network genome directly as a graph structure. Mutations can operate on the structure of the network by adding new links (by connecting two nodes not previously connected) or new nodes (by splitting an existing connection), or can operate only on changing the weights associated with edges in the graphs (called mutating the weights). &#xD;&#xA;To give you an idea of the order of magnitude of the sizes of ANNs this particular algorithm works with, it would likely struggle with more than 100 or 200 nodes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are more scalable TWEANNs, but they're more complex and make assumptions about the kinds of structures they generate that may not always be productive in practice. For example, another way to encode the structure of a neural network, is as the product of a seed pattern that is repeatedly expanded by a grammar (e.g. an L-system). You can much more easily explore larger structures, but because they're generated by a grammar they'll have a characteristic self-repeating sort of feel. HyperNEAT is a popular extension of NEAT that makes a different sort of assumption (that patterns of weights can be easily expressed as a function of geometry), and can scale to ANNs with millions of connections when that assumption well-fits a particular domain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a few survey papers linked in the top link if you want to observe a greater variety of techniques." />

(Sadly, it's paywalled and I couldn't easily find a ungated copy, so I don't have a summary for you.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The abstract:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Bright has built an automated system for ranking job candidates against job descriptions. The candidate's resume and social media profiles are interwoven to build an augmented user profile. Similarly, the job description is augmented by external databases and user-generated content to build an enhanced job profile. These augmented user and job profiles are then analyzed in order to develop numerical overlap features each with strong discriminating power, and in sum with maximal coverage. The resulting feature scores are then combined into a single Bright Score using a custom algorithm, where the feature weights are derived from a nation-wide and controlled study in which we collected a large sample of human judgments on real resume-job pairings. We demonstrate that the addition of social media profile data and external data improves the classification accuracy dramatically in terms of identifying the most qualified candidates." />

Ignoring for the moment that we're a day or two behind on AI, they're very much alike: &#xA;Both fields contain a wide variety of sub-fields which stretch across multiple disciplines (although admittedly more pronounced in AI) , in both fields it is mandatory to specialize and in both of them an expert in one sub-field will be more or less useless in a different one (the expert on bridge construction will probably not be very versed in the thermodynamics of AC systems and vice versa). This pattern can be seen in many of today's disciplines - in fact, I don't know if there still is a reputable field, in which a single person can be a universal expert. &#xA;&#xA;You mentioned that the only unifying thing about AI was it's dealing with machines in some fashion - but such a simplifying statement can be made about almost any field. To return to my previous example: the only unifying thing about the various Engineering activities is that they're all somehow involved in the construction of something (be it a flashlight or an aircraft carrier).&#xA;&#xA;AI is a young field and therefore its branches have not yet been established in the sophisticated way that the branches of other fields have, but I would assume that it is only a matter of time until the various differentiations and the corresponding degrees, courses etc. develop.  &#xA;&#xA;AI is also growing up in a time where vast knowledge in its related/parental fields already exists and further knowledge is produced at dizzying speeds - and that is as much a blessing as it is a curse. When Engineering was 'created' a few millennia ago (please excuse my ridiculously inaccurate science history lessons) there wasn't much going on in the world of science and so the field grew slowly, with plenty of time to get organized and structured. That is a luxury which AI did/does not have. It emerged in an age of technical wonders, surrounded by scientific breakthroughs on at least a monthly basis and the rise of interdisciplinary science (which by itself complicated things quite a bit). So in addition to organizing itself, the field also has to continuously integrate the large number of advancements made and somehow stand its ground against the outlandish expectations generated by other science's breakthroughs over the past decades and the media (as already explained by SQLServerSteve). &#xA;&#xA;Long story short: it's similar in it's complexity and diversity to other fields and therefore has no reason to collapse - on the contrary, its failure to do so over the past ~50 rather complicated years indicates, that it will further solidify and organize itself in the future.

Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some more background you might want to read up on [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other major regard in which something you could call &quot;search&quot; applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as &quot;optimisation&quot; techniques.  This would be things like Hill Climbing, Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing and perhaps even Genetic Algorithms.  These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some equation and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you're trying to minimize the delta between the &quot;correct&quot; answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

But that's OK, because I don't think anybody believes the human brain is calculating floating point math using digital computing techniques either.  The human brain appears, at least superficially, to be largely probabilistic and able to tolerate some &quot;slop&quot; numerically.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downside to analog computers, as I understand it, is that they're not as flexible... you basically hardwire a circuit to do one specific &quot;thing&quot; and that's really all it can do.

Every problem has an input within some range (the domain) and an output in some other range (codomain).  That is, every problem can be formulated as a kind of map from one space to another, where the source is the givens of the problem, and the destination is the solution to the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Brute force&quot; is the algorithm which solves every problem by inspecting every point in the codomain and asking: &quot;Is this the solution?&quot;  Every other algorithm is an attempt to improve on brute force by not searching the entire codomain of possible solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typical software engineering problems can be solved by algorithms which arrive at the correct solution very quickly (sorting, arithmetic, partition, etc.).  AI problems are generally those for which a strong polynomial  algorithm is not known, and thus, we must settle for approximations.  Basically every common problem that the human brain must solve falls into this category.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consider the problem of moving a multi-jointed robotic arm to pick up an object.  Reverse kinematics does not have unique solutions: there is more than one way to move your hand from a start position to a target position.  This is due to the excessive degrees of freedom in your joints.  If you want to minimize energy usage, then there is a unique solution (due to the asymmetry of joints and muscles).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what if there is an obstacle in the pathway of the minimum-energy solution?  There are many pathways which avoid the obstacle, but again, many of them will have a similar cost.  Even if there is a unique minimum-energy solution, it might not be the most practical to compute.  The brain is the most metabolically expensive organ in the body, so it is not always best to find an optimal solution.  Thus, heuristics come into play.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But in all cases, the problem is not: &quot;move your hand&quot; or &quot;move the robot arm.&quot;  The problem is: &quot;search the space of joint rotation sequences which best achieves the goal.&quot;  And even though there is a closed-form solution for the simple minimum-energy case with no obstacles, it is too expensive to compute precisely when a set of cheap heuristics will get you very close with a small fraction of the computational effort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If computation were free, then AI would be mere mathematics, and we would always compute the best answer to every question using logic, calculus, physics, at worst, numerical methods when we don't have closed-form solutions.  In reality, time is money, and the time and effort to get an answer is as much a part of the cost as the quality of the solution.  So it is an engineering tradeoff to decide how much effort should be expended in what way to obtain the best answer given the value of the response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or, in other words, AI problems are all about searching the space of solutions as quickly as possible to get an answer that is &quot;good enough&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I might seem curious that such far-flung problems as natural language recognition and theorem proving would be search problems.  But language parsers strive to determine the meaning of statements via part-of-speech tagging.  A given phrase can be parsed in many different ways, yielding many different interpretations, and the space of parse trees is yet another search problem in deciding which parse tree is the most likely intended meaning by the speaker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A theorem proof is graph starting with axioms, proceeding through lemmas, applying the rules of procedure until the theorem is derived or refuted (by proving its negation).  There are many ways to represent this sequence, but at the end of the day, we are talking about a process of exploring the intermediate proof space and finding the derivation which reaches your goal.  Everything is search, in the end." />

Imagine a ANN that is trained to use the screen input of a computer game to play it. If the game is very rich and conceptually deep the internal representation of a single screen input might be a lot bigger than the input itself, because ANNs put the single data points into the context of the overall data. Which leads us to the second point:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ANNs (and the neocortex) model data hierarchically. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is what makes them so powerful. So it is not just about having a large number of parameters, they also have to be arranged in such a way that they capture the structure of the data (or the world), which very often seems to be hierarchical. Just look a two different pictures of a duck. On the pixel level they might be as different as random images, all the similarities emerge in higher levels of the hierarchy, when enough pixels combined give you the patterns of feathers, beak and webs.

First, what many people refer to as &quot;search&quot; is a reflection of how what we call &quot;intelligence&quot; frequently involves searching something:  a physical realm, a &quot;state space&quot; of possible solutions, a &quot;knowledge space&quot; where ideas/facts/concepts/etc. are related as a graph structure, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look up some old papers on computer chess, and you'll see that a lot of that involves searching a &quot;state space&quot;.  As such, search algorithms that are efficient (in terms of time complexity and/or space complexity) have always been important to making advances there.  And while computer chess is just one example, the principle generalizes to many other kinds of problem solving and goal seeking activities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's [a reference](http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/artificialintelligence/nonflash/problemframenf.htm) that explains more about some of these ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note too that &quot;search&quot; is closely related to the idea of &quot;heuristics&quot; in an important way.  Many search problems in the real world are far too complex to solve by exhaustive brute-force search, so humans (and AI's) resort to heuristics to narrow the state space being searched.  Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some more background you might want to read up on [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other major regard in which something you could call &quot;search&quot; applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as &quot;optimisation&quot; techniques.  This would be things like Hill Climbing, Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing and perhaps even Genetic Algorithms.  These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some function  and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you're trying to minimize the delta between the &quot;correct&quot; answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

[Here][4] is a very readable paper by Flanagan and Polger that also explains why a stronger neurological version of the Turing test is insufficient to detect a Zombie.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: In response to the comment about whether an objective test for distinguishing sentience from non-sentience exists:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No-one knows.

David Chalmers has speculated that qualia should be introduced as a new form of physical unit, orthogonal to the others in the same way that electrical charge is orthogonal to distance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the absence of an objective test, we have to rely on Turing test variants, which no more guarantee consciousness in the subject than they do intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/unzombie.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://consc.net/zombies.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://homepages.uc.edu/~polgertw/Polger-ZombiesJCS.pdf" />

I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that are swear words in other cultures for an example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them capture the complexity of the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever' at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how *he* thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos / images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'Emblems' are gestures which have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that *this* particular movement is *this* gesture which means *this*), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production is in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if its not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture." />

I don't think anybody knows a definite answer, but some rough-sketch ideas seem apparent.  Think about what it means to you to be &quot;self aware&quot;.  You'll probably cite the way you &quot;hear&quot; your own thoughts in your head when you think about something.  One can speculate that inside the brain, the various centers that are responsible for hearing, vision, logic, etc. are connected so that as you form a thought, it's being &quot;heard&quot; by the hearing regions, even though it's purely internal instead of actual sound received at the ear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in AI terms, it seems likely that self-awareness will somehow involve taking the &quot;thoughts&quot; formed within the AI, and feeding them back into the AI so that it &quot;hears&quot; (or, more broadly, &quot;senses&quot;) itself think.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's this weirdly recursive aspect to all of this, which - interestingly enough - is something Douglas Hofstadter talked about a lot in some of his book, especially [GEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach).

I just think that that light form of multi-task learning might be better. The idea of multi-task learning is that a predictor predicting multiple variables (in this case the various Q(s,a1), Q(s,a2), ...) using mostly the same structure (varying only the output weights) will learn more sensible things. Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is Tile Coding (https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.&#xD;&#xA;Now you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions.

I just think that that light form of multi-task learning might be better. The idea of multi-task learning is that a predictor predicting multiple variables (in this case the various Q(s,a1), Q(s,a2), ...) using mostly the same structure (varying only the output weights) will learn more sensible things. Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is [Tile Coding][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.&#xD;&#xA;Now you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions. But, again, I am no expert in deep nets so I may be wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, according to Andrej Karpathy, &quot;most people prefer to use Policy Gradients, including the authors of the original DQN paper who have shown Policy Gradients to work better than Q Learning when tuned well.&quot;. This means that you may be better off not using Q-learning (as they did in the original DQN formulation) to train your net. Have a look at [Andrej's blog][2] and [the paper he points to][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783" />

If it is supposed to solve a single easy task perfectly and professionally, sure emotions would not be very useful. But if it is supposed to learn random new things, there would be a point that it encounters something it cannot handle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Lee Sedol vs AlphaGo match 4, some pro who has said computer doesn't have emotions previously, commented that maybe AlphaGo has emotions too, and stronger than human. In this case, we know that AlphaGo's crazy behavior isn't caused by some deliberately added things called &quot;emotions&quot;, but a flaw in the algorithm. But it behaves exactly like it has panicked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this happens a lot for an AI. There might be advantages if it could know this itself and think twice if it happens. If AlphaGo could detect the problem and change its strategy, it might play better, or worse. It's not unlikely to play worse if it didn't do any computations for other approaches at all. In case it would play worse, we might say it suffers from having &quot;emotions&quot;, and this might be the reason some people think having emotions could be a flaw of human beings. But that wouldn't be the true cause of the problem. The true cause is it just doesn't know any approaches to guarantee winning, and the change in strategy is only a try to fix the problem. Commentators thinks there are better ways (which also don't guarantee winning but had more chance), but its algorithm isn't capable to find out in this situation. Even for human, the solution to anything related to emotion is unlikely to remove emotions, but some training to make sure you understand the situation enough to act calmly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then someone has to argue about whether this is a kind of emotion or not. We usually don't say small insects have human-like emotions, because we don't understand them and are unwilling to help them. But it's easy to know some of them could panic in desperate situations, just like AlphaGo did. I'd say these reactions are based on the same logic, and they are at least the reason why human-like emotions could be potentially useful. They are just not expressed in human-understandable ways, as they didn't intend to call a human for help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If they tries to understand their own behavior, or call someone else for help, it might be good to be exactly human-like. Some pets can sense human emotions and express human-understandable emotion to some degree. The purpose is to interact with humans. They evolved to have this ability because they needed it at some point. It's likely a full strong AI would need it too. Also note that, the opposite of having full emotions might be becoming crazy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is probably a quick way to lose any trust if someone just implement emotions imitating humans with little understanding right away in the first generations, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Weak AIs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But is there any purposes for them to have emotions before someone wanted a strong AI? I'd say no, there isn't any inherent reasons that they must have emotions. But inevitably someone will want to implement imitated emotions anyway. Whether &quot;we&quot; need them to have emotions is just nonsense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact is even some programs without any intelligence contained some &quot;emotional&quot; elements in their user interfaces. They may look unprofessional, but not every task needs professionality so they could be perfectly acceptable. They are just like the emotions in musics and arts. Someone will design their weak AI in this way too. But they are not really the AIs' emotions, but their creators'. If you feel better or worse because of their emotions, you won't treat individul AIs so differently, but this model or brand as a whole.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively someone could plant some personallities like in a role-playing game there. Again, there isn't a reason they must have that, but inevitably someone will do it, because they obviously had some market when a role-playing game does.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In either cases, the emotions don't really originate from the AI itself. And it would be easy to implement, because a human won't expect them to be exactly like a human, but tries to understand what they intended to mean. It could be much easier to accept these emotions realizing this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Aspects of emotions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sorry about posting some original research here. I made a list of emotions in 2012 and from which I see 4 aspects of emotions. If they are all implemented, I'd say they are exactly the same emotions as of humans. They don't seem real if only some of them are implemented, but that doesn't mean they are completely wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The reason, or the original logical problem that the AI cannot solve. AlphaGo already had the reason, but nothing else. If I have to make an accurate definition, I'd say it's the state that multiple equally important heuristics disagreeing with each other.&#xD;&#xA;  * The context, or which part of the current approach is considered not working well and should probably be replaced. This distinguishes sadness-related, worry-related and passionate-related.&#xD;&#xA;  * The current state, or whether it feels leading, or whether its belief or the fact is supposed to turn bad first (or was bad all along) if things go wrong. This distinguishes sadness-related, love-related and proud-related.&#xD;&#xA;* The plan or request. I suppose some domesticated pets already had this. And I suppose these had some fixed patterns which is not too difficult to have. Even arts can contain them easily. Unlike the reasons, these are not likely inherent in any algorithms, and multiple of them can appear together.&#xD;&#xA;  * Who supposedly had the responsibility if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes curiosity, rage and sadness.&#xD;&#xA;  * What is the supposed plan if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes disappointment, sadness and surprise.&#xD;&#xA;* The source. Without context, even a human cannot reliably tell someone is crying for being moved or thankful, or smiling for some kind of embarrassment. In most other cases there aren't even words describing them. It doesn't make that much difference if an AI doesn't distinguish or show this specially. It's likely they would learn these automatically (and inaccurately as a human) at the point they could learn to understand human languages.&#xD;&#xA;* The measurements, such as how urgent or important the problem is, or even how likely the emotions are true. I'd say it cannot be implemented in the AI. Humans don't need to respect them even if they are exactly like humans. But humans will learn how to understand an AI if that really matters, even if they are not like humans at all. In fact, I feel that some of the extremely weak emotions (such as thinking something is too stupid and boring that you don't know how to comment) exist almost exclusively in emoticons, where someone intend to show you exactly this emotion, and hardly noticeable in real life or any complex scenerios. I supposed this could also be the case in the beginning for AIs. In the worst case, they are firstly conventionally known as &quot;emotions&quot; since emoticons works in these cases, so it's easier to group them together, but very few people seriously think they are, just like the example I gave.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So when strong AIs become possible, none of these would be unreachable, though there might be a lot of work to make the connections. So I'd say if there would be the need for strong AIs, they absolutely would have emotions.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Yes, you can find instances of geniuses like Ramanujan solving complex problem during or after a dream state, but those involve partial consciousness. You don't see guys like Einstein coming up with the theory of relativity while in a coma; the Founding Fathers didn't write the Declaration of Independence while sleep-walking; in fact, you can't even find instances of housewives putting together their shopping list for the week during deep delta-wave sleep. This is predicated on a hard definition of intelligence, requiring the use of reason; no one says, &quot;That fly is intelligent&quot; or &quot;that squirrel is intelligent&quot; precisely because neither is capable of using reason. This is a very high bar for A.I., but it is the common sense definition used by ordinary people as a matter of practicality, in everyday speech.  Likewise, in practice, everyone assumes consciousness is necessary to the exercise of that kind of intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conversely, we can come up with another common-sense based criterion for judging objections to this argument, particularly the solipsist one, based on 3 elements: 1) practicality; 2) the effect the objections have on those who hold them sincerely; and 3) the effect that actions based on those beliefs have on others. **It's going to take me several paragraphs to make this case, but the length is necessary if I want to make the case in a complete, thorough fashion**. It is true that we cannot prove that another human being possesses consciousness, if our standard is absolute proof. We cannot, in fact, provide absolute proof for anything; there's always room for some objection, no matter how ridiculous or trifling. As some philosophers have pointed out, perhaps all of reality as we know it is just a dream, or the product of some long, involved conspiracy like the plot of the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show. The key to meeting such objections is that they require an infinite regress of increasingly untenable objections, whose likelihood plunges with each additional step required to justify such unreasonable doubts; I've always wondered if we could come up with a &quot;Ridiculousness Metric&quot; for Machine Learning based on the cardinality of such objections (or the pickiness of fuzzy sets). If we were to allow critics to stick their foot in the door with all manner of unreasonable objections, it would be impossible to close any debate. The human race would be paralyzed in inaction because nothing would be decidable; but as the rock band Rush once pointed out, &quot;If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.&quot; At some point we must apply a test to decide such things, even in the absence of absolute proof; refusal to apply a test also constitutes a choice. Settling an argument of this kind is like a game  of the Chinese game Go - once the other player's surrounded and has no more moves left to make, the game is over; if a person's evidence has debunked and they have no further justifications left, then we can conclude that they're acting unreasonably. There are people running around claiming the Holocaust never happened, or the Flat Earth Society, etc., but their existence shouldn't and doesn't stop us from taking action contrary to their ideas. We can debunk the objections of cranks like the Flat Earth Society beyond a reasonable doubt because in the end, they simply can't answer all of our rebuttals. I’m glad that qualia and Philosophical Zombies were brought up because they make for interesting conversation and food for thought, but solipsism is acted upon as rarely as the ideas of the Flat Earth Society precisely because the incomplete evidence we **do** have runs against it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As G.K. Chesterton (a.k.a. &quot;The Apostle of Common Sense&quot;) points out in his classic [Orthodoxy][1], radical doubt of the kind many classical philosophers preached is not a path to wisdom but to madness; once we go beyond a reasonable doubt, we end up acting unreasonably. He says that in the absence of absolute proof we can fall back on another secondary form of evidence: whether a person's philosophy leads a man to Hanwell, the infamous British mental institution. Chesterton makes a good case that when people actually act on ideas like solipsism (rather than merely debating them in a pedantic manner in an ivy-covered classroom) they go mad The Philosophical Zombie argument is close to solipsism, which is actually one of the diagnostic criteria for certain forms of schizophrenia. The dehumanization that occurs when radical doubt is applied to qualia is also intimately tied in with sociopathic behavior, Although GKC does not cite his scary example directly, Rene Descartes was himself living proof. He was a brilliant mathematician who is still cheered for doubting all except his own existence, with the famous maxim &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; But Descartes also used to carry a mannequin of his dead sister with him to European cafes, where he could be seen chatting with it. The gist of all this is that we can judge the worth of an idea by how it affects the well-being of the believer, or by how they in turn affect others through ethical choices based on those beliefs. When people actually act on radical doubt of the kind expressed in solipsism and denial of common qualia, it often has a bad effect on them and others they come in contact with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a roundabout way, the A.I. community also faces a quite serious risk - perhaps a permanent temptation - towards making the opposite mistake, of ascribing common qualia, consciousness and the like to its Machine Learning products without adequate proof. I recently heard a case made on shockingly bad logical grounds by well-respected academics to the effect that plants possess &quot;intelligence,&quot; based on really weak definitions and clear confusion with self-organization. We cannot provide absolute proof that a rock doesn't have intelligence, which amounts to the old problem of disproving a negative. Thankfully, few men actually act on such beliefs at present, because when they do, they end up losing their minds. If we take such arguments seriously, we might see laws passed to protect the kind of Pet Rocks that were popular in the '70s (I'm still upset that mine was stolen LOL). It would be a lot easier, however, to make the same mistake of ascribing consciousness, intelligence and other such qualities to a state-of-the-art machine, because of wishful thinking, hubris, the lofty credentials of the inventors, the influence of science fiction and the modern love affair with technology. In the future, I have little doubt that we'll have Cargo Cult of A.I. - perhaps legally protected like some kind of endangered species, with civil rights, but having no more consciousness, soul or actual intelligence than a rock. Don't quote me on this, but I believe Rod Serling once wrote a story to this effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best way to avoid this fate is to stick to the common sense interpretations and definitions of these things, which we keep backing away from in large part because they set a very high bar for A.I. that we may never be able to surpass in our lifetimes, if ever. Perhaps A.I. isn't even logically possible, at any level of technology; I recall a few proofs that can be interpreted to that effect. Those high but reasonable standards may be increasingly difficult to stick to if Chesterton and colleagues like Hilaire Belloc and Arnold Lunn were correct in their assessment that the use of reason has actually been breaking down in Western civilization, at least as far back as the Enlightenment; Lunn's 1931 book The Flight from Reason is a classic in this regard and has yet to be rebutted.  This historical trend is a broad topic in and of itself - but suffice it to say that the denial of reason and obsession with technology are both directly relevant in obvious ways to the field of A.I. If the Flight from Reason is still under way, then we will be increasingly tempted to resort to feckless, facile objections in order to demote the use of reason and indispensable qualities like consciousness in our definitions of A.I., but come up with increasingly weak criteria for proving it; simultaneously, our technology will continue to improve, thereby boosting the &quot;Artificial&quot; side of Artificial Intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't get me wrong: if I didn't think we can do some really exciting things with A.I., I wouldn't be here. But most of them can be achieved without ever replicating actual human intelligence, by solving whole classes of tangential problems that are difficult for humans to think about, but which do not require consciousness or the use of reason that marks human intelligence. The image recognition capabilities of convolutional neural nets are one example, for instance; if we want human intelligence, we can always manufacture it through the easiest, most economical and time-tested way, by having babies. Perhaps these tangential forms of A.I. should be enough for us for now. We cannot inject the use of reason into our machines if we do not possess enough of it ourselves to decide whether reason is necessary for A.I., or even to discern what it consists of. We can't engineer or deprecate consciousness for A.I. till we're conscious of its significance. I'd wager, however, that everyone reading this thread and weighing intelligent responses is doing so in a conscious state. That in and of itself ought to answer our question satisfactorily for now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130" />

People with Type A personalities are often high-achieving &quot;workaholics.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of those attributes could conceivably be explicitly programmed in. Alternatively, most of them could arise from a basic goal of performing a certain task as efficiently as possible. After all, if you really want to carry out a task, you're going to get organized, you'll only do other things if they're asked of you by someone important, you won't want to get bogged down in irrelevant things, you'll actively pursue the necessary resources, and you'll want to use time as effectively as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that this applies only to strong AIs, since weak AIs like image recognizers don't generally have personalities that we can interact with. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, just for fun, let's consider an overly aggressive personality, to the point of a disorder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This Counselling Resource page](http://counsellingresource.com/features/2008/11/03/aggressive-personalities/) seems helpful in describing what an aggressive person *does*.

I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that are swear words in other cultures for an example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them capture the complexity of the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever' at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how *he* thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos / images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'Emblems' are gestures which have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that *this* particular movement is *this* gesture which means *this*), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production is in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if its not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture." />

No. Although if you reinforce the behavior of going next to the lever slowly and at the end he will lever press and you then reinforce that behavior he will.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, passion is compartmentalized, and that's what you have to do in your NT and make it mathematically&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; WINK WINK:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Small hint, it's a progressive function" />

This includes variants like Bidirectional, Jordan and Elman Networks. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a more sophisticated neural net algorithm which can accomplish the same time and sequence-based tasks, but which can leverage standard learning methods like backprop since it doesn't suffer from the &quot;vanishing gradient problem.&quot; This is because LSTMs have been brilliantly engineered as &quot;perfect integrators,&quot; which makes it a lot easier to calculate the error gradients etc. over long periods of time. In contrast, learning with RNNs is still not theoretically well-grounded and is difficult to calculate through existing methods like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). In Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs), the idea is to add new neurons and connections with each new training example across a stretch of time or training sequence; unfortunately, this places a practical limitation on how many examples you can feed into the net before the size of the network gets out of hand or it starts forgetting, just as with RNNs. LSTMs have much longer memories (especially when augmented with Neural Turing Machines) so that'd be my first choice, assuming I wanted to use neural nets for NLP purposes. My knowledge of the subject is limited though (I'm still trying to learn the ropes) so there may be other important neural net algorithms I'm overlooking..." />

The &quot;AGI&quot; must learn...and that learning process can take time. If you want an AGI to drive a car or play Go, you have to find some way of &quot;teaching&quot; it. Keep in mind that we have never built AGIs, so we don't know how long the training process can be, but it would be safe to assume pessimistic estimates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Contrast that to a &quot;narrow intelligence&quot;. The narrow AI already knows how to drive a car or play Go. It has been programmed to be very excellent at one specific task. You don't need to worry about training the machine, because it has already been pre-trained.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A &quot;general intelligence&quot; seems to be more flexible than a &quot;narrow intelligence&quot;. You could buy an AGI and have it drive a car *and* play Go. And if you are willing to do more training, you can even teach it a new trick: *how to bake a cake*. I don't have to worry about unexpected tasks coming up, since the AGI will *eventually* figure out how to do it, given enough training time. I would have to wait a *long time* though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A &quot;narrow intelligence&quot; appears to be *more efficient* at its assigned task, due to it being programmed specifically for that task. It knows exactly what to do, and doesn't have to waste time &quot;learning&quot; (unlike our AGI buddy here). Instead of buying one AGI to handle a bunch of different tasks poorly, I would rather buy a bunch of specialized narrow AIs. Narrow AI #1 drives cars, Narrow AI #2 plays Go, Narrow AI #3 bake cakes, etc. That being said, this is a very brittle approach, since if some unexpected task comes up, none of my narrow AIs would be able to handle it. I'm willing to accept that risk though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is my &quot;thinking&quot; correct? Is there a trade-off between flexibility (AGI) and efficiency (narrow AI), like what I have just described above? Or is it theoretically possible for an AGI to be both flexible and efficient?" />

Therefore &quot;it's not depth, but the ensemble&quot; strikes me as a false dichotomy.

I still am, despite the fact that I have a few reservations about some of his philosophical musings on the meanings of consciousness, free will and other such topics. I won't elaborate on those misgivings here because they're not germane to the main, overwhelming reason why HTM nets haven't succeeded as much as expected to date: to my knowledge, Numenta has only implemented a truncated version of his vision. They left out most of the prediction architecture, which plays such a critical role in Hawkins' theories. As Gerod M. Bonhoff put it in [an excellent thesis][1][1] on HTMs, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;In March of 2007, Numenta released what they claimed was a “research&#xD;&#xA;&gt; implementation” of HTM theory called Numenta Platform for Intelligent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Computing (NuPIC). The algorithm used by NuPIC at this time is called&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Zeta1.” NuPIC was released as an open source software platform and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; binary files of the Zeta1 algorithm. Because of licensing, this paper&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is not allowed to discuss the proprietary implementation aspects of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Numenta’s Zeta1 algorithm. There are, however, generalized&#xD;&#xA;&gt; concepts of implementation that can be discussed freely. The two most&#xD;&#xA;&gt; important of these are how the Zeta 1 algorithm (encapsulated in each&#xD;&#xA;&gt; memory node of the network hierarchy) implements HTM theory. To&#xD;&#xA;&gt; implement any theory in software, an algorithmic design for each&#xD;&#xA;&gt; aspect of the theory must be addressed. The most important design&#xD;&#xA;&gt; decision Numenta adopted was to eliminate feedback within the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hierarchy and instead choose to simulate this theoretical concept&#xD;&#xA;&gt; using only data pooling algorithms for weighting. This decision is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; immediately suspect and violates key concepts of HTM. Feedback,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hawkins’ insists, is vital to cortical function and central to his&#xD;&#xA;&gt; theories. Still, Numenta claims that most HTM applicable problems can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be solved using their implementation and proprietary pooling&#xD;&#xA;&gt; algorithms.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am still learning the ropes in this field and cannot say whether or not Numenta has since scrapped this approach in favor of a full implementation of Hawkins' ideas, especially the all-important prediction architecture. Even if they have, this design decision has probably delayed adoption by many years. That's not a criticism per se; perhaps the computational costs of tracking prediction values and updating them on the fly were too much to bear at the time, on top of the ordinary costs of processing neural nets, leaving them with no other path except to try half-measures like their proprietary pooling mechanisms. Nevertheless, all of the best research papers I've read on the topic since then have chosen to reimplement the algorithms rather than relying on Numenta's platform, typically because of the missing prediction features. Cases in point include Bonhoff's thesis and [Maltoni's technical report for the University of Bologna Biometric System Laboratory][2][2]. In all of those cases, however, there is no readily accessible software for putting their variant HTMs to immediate use (as far as I know). The gist of all this is that like G.K. Chesterton's famous maxim about Christianity, &quot;HTMs have not been tried and found wanting; they have been found difficult, and left untried.&quot; Since Numenta left out the prediction steps, I assume that they would be the main stumbling blocks awaiting anyone who wants to code Hawkins' full vision of what an HTM should be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]Bonhoff, Gerod M., 2008, Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Detecting Anomalous Network Activity.

It does not mention technical methods such as neural networks but it gives a good history (and very nice stories) on what people had done on that field. It gives you the notion that in order to get achieve a better payoff, your goal is not actually making a better prediction but choosing the better options by considering what other players are doing. If you ask why it is not just the better prediction, the answer is that there is always a balance of risk and payoff and since you cannot find a 100% guaranteed way of prediction, you will have to balance risk and payoff in order to gain in the long run. In addition, although theory suggests that you can make a good prediction by gathering all variables, this is not really possible in practice. Thus, human assistance and observing what others are doing is used as a way to improve mathematical predictions and possible payoffs." />

This is a pretty classic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; problem - he finds a viable, not necessarily optimal but &quot;good enough&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; route using the A* algorithm, by taking the terrain layout and vehicle&#xD;&#xA;&gt; capabilities into account, and modifying a direct (straight) line path&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to account for these. The whole map is known a'priori and invariant,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; though the start and destination are arbitrary (user-chosen) and the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; path is not guaranteed to exist at all.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This cookie-cutter approach comes with a twist: limited storage space.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We can afford some more volatile memory on start, but we should free&#xD;&#xA;&gt; most of it once the route has been found. The travel may take days -&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of real time too, so the path must be saved to disk, and the space in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the save file for custom data like this is severely limited. Too&#xD;&#xA;&gt; limited to save all the waypoints - even after culling trivial&#xD;&#xA;&gt; solution waypoints ('continue straight ahead'), and by a rather large&#xD;&#xA;&gt; margin, order of 20% the size of our data set.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A solution we came up with is to calculate the route once on start,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; then 'forget' all the trivial and 90% of the non-trivial waypoints.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This both serves as a proof that a solution exists, and provides a set&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of points reaching which, in sequence, guarantees the route will take&#xD;&#xA;&gt; us to the destination.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Once the vehicle reaches a waypoint, the route to the next one is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; calculated again, from scratch. It's known to exist and be correct&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (because we did it once, and it was correct), it doesn't put too much&#xD;&#xA;&gt; strain on the CPU and the memory (it's only about 10% the total route&#xD;&#xA;&gt; length) and it doesn't need to go into permanent storage (restarting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from any point along the path is just a subset of the solution&#xD;&#xA;&gt; connecting two saved waypoints).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---------------&#xD;&#xA;Now for the actual question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The pathfinding algorithm follows a sparse set of waypoints which by themselves are not nearly sufficient as a route, but allow for easy, efficient  calculation of the actual route, simultaneously guarantying its existence; they are a subset of the full solution. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this a heuristic approach?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(as I understand, normally, heuristics don't guarantee existence of a solution, and merely suggest more likely candidates. In this case, the 'hints' are taken straight out of an actual working solution, thus my doubts.)" />

This is proven by the fact that the species AMG processes on earth have produce humans, which are individual level AMGs. Individual level AMGs can produce arbitrary machines for arbitrary purposes on human time-scales.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem is that the simplest possible (and most general) AMG is a purely _random_ machine generator. Any more specificity (and therefore complexity) to the AMG would constrain the domains it closes over.

Again, there's no free context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Humans are AMGs, but we are only efficient at creating certain kinds of machines, using our imagination.

And, again, while human intelligence _is_ an AMG, any given AMG that is optimized for generating machines of a particular type will be less optimized for generating machines of some other type(s). There's no free context. The most general search algorithm is a random walk - there is no way to _improve_ the generality of the random walk, other than just speeding it up.

And then there are those rare situations where I actually _want_ you to cut off my arm and put it on a pressure plate, perhaps to save a loved one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we could make a thing that could sympathize with what a human _might_ need in any given arbitrary situation, then we will have created either A) an artificial _human_ intelligence (AHI) (which could be more or less fallible, like a human), or B) an oracle that can reason about _all possible human needs_ on much faster than human time-scales - in which case you wouldn't _need_ a conscious AI, as all human needs and solutions could be pre-computed via formal specification, which is probably absurd to consider." />

A discrete universe can allow for apparent continuous behavior via approximation and randomness (or pseudorandomness), whereas a universe that is infinitely divisible affords no obvious definition of where things should start and end. This is one of the reasons many thinkers eschew considering infinities - they may be illusory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, can analog &quot;circuits&quot; execute faster than digital? As of right now, we know of some _seemingly_ analog phenomena that _appear_ execute faster than some digital phenomena (like electron spin vs a silicon logic gate). Whether analog phenomena are _intrinsically_ more efficient than digital depends on the actual nature of the universe, which we have not yet determined." />

Text="I am currently reading *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies* by Nick Bostrom. When he discusses whole brain emulation, although computing power (storage, bandwidth, CPU, body simulation, &amp; environment simulation) is one of the three general key things we are lacking toward its success, he also seems to agree that computing power is the most feasible and attainable of the three general issues we have for attaining it as of now. However he also goes on to to say &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Just how much technology is required for whole brain emulation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; depends on the level of abstraction at which the brain is simulated.&lt;sup&gt;[ref][1]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which is an interesting thought, but a whole different discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyways, so I think you are correct in thinking that we aren't far from having the computing power and maybe you are on to something, but rather are biggest hurdles are the other two key prerequisites that we need to attain before we can even begin trying, which are scanning, and translation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of the three, it would seem translation is the one we need to advance in the most, as of now. A modest prediction of attaining whole brain emulation is at least 15 years or mid century. Theres much more information in this book of all of the different paths that can be taken to achieve super intelligence, and it is well researched, I highly recommend it if you haven't read it already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1mMJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41&amp;lpg=PT41&amp;dq=%22Just%20how%20much%20technology%20is%20required%20for%20whole%20brain%20emulation%20depends%20on%20the%20level%20of%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pmw4PUDele&amp;sig=PfmDRgcJuKBf3TwyCoVtCmp9XmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4gZy6tbnPAhVRF8AKHUoQDD8Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Just%20how%20much%20technology%20is%20required%20for%20whole%20brain%20emulation%20depends%20on%20the%20level%20of%22&amp;f=false" />

I'm not sure it translates well into AI though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems they're separating information from knowledge by splitting how from what. What is a superset of how, as far as I'm concerned. It's also a superset of why.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But from an evolutionary perspective, knowledge representation starts with why. Prior to a reason for knowledge representation, there is no knowledge representation. The 'what' existed, but it was not represented until autopoiesis created goal directed, why-oriented behaviors that began storing the what as knowledge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is a superset of why, just as ontology is a superset of teleology. However, all *represented* ontology was acquired through teleological (end-directed) action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I disagree with the notion that wisdom, as a why thing, is at the tip of the pyramid. It all started with goal directed behavior and that has been the source of all subsequent information growth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is wisdom? I think it is too much of a folk term to warrant a technical definition.

However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually *is*. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence actually is and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence. So the AI Effect occurs because humans don't know how to define &quot;intelligence&quot;, not due to people dismissing programs as not being &quot;intelligent&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this argument valid or correct? And if not, why not?" />

However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually *is*. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence. So the AI Effect occurs because humans don't know how to define &quot;intelligence&quot;, not due to people dismissing programs as not being &quot;intelligent&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this argument valid or correct? And if not, why not?" />

If they did, they'd have basically solved AGI.  But we can certainly talk about techniques that get part-of-the-way there, and approaches that could work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing I would consider trying (and I don't know off-hand if anybody has tried this exact approach) is to model the disambiguation of each word as a discrete problem for a [Bayesian Belief Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) where your priors (for any given word) are based on both stored &quot;knowledge&quot; as well as the previously encountered words in the (sentence|paragraph|document|whatever).  So if you &quot;know&quot;, for example, that &quot;Reading is a city in the UK&quot; and that &quot;place names are usually capitalized&quot;, your network should be strongly biased towards interpreting &quot;Reading&quot; as the city, since nothing in the word position in the sentence strongly contradicts that.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course I'm hand-waving around some tricky problems in saying that, as [knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) isn't exactly a solved problem either.  But there are at least approaches out there that you could use.  For example, you could use the [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) / triple based approach from the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) world.  Finding a good way to merge that stuff with a Bayesian framework could yield some interesting results.    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There has been a bit of research on &quot;probabilistic RDF&quot; that you could possibly use as a starting point.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://om.umiacs.umd.edu/material/papers/prdf.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-173/pos_paper5.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://www.w3.org/2005/03/07-yoshio-UMBC/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/paper/html/id/271/BayesOWL-Uncertainty-Modeling-in-Semantic-Web-Ontologies&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.pr-owl.org/&#xD;&#xA;" />

It is also generally ignored by researchers of Computational Creativity, who already have their own tests to evaluate creativity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Longer Answer:&#xD;&#xA;According to Google Scholar, there are 10 references to the &quot;Lovelace Test 2.0&quot; paper. All of those references exist merely to point out that the Lovelace Test 2.0 exists. In fact, at least two of articles I consulted ([A novel approach for identifying a human-like self-conscious behavior](http://philpapers.org/archive/NEGANA.pdf) and [FraMoTEC: A Framework for Modular Task-Environment Construction for Evaluating Adaptive Control Systems](http://users.dsic.upv.es/~flip/EGPAI2016/papers/EGPAI_2016_paper_8.pdf)) proposed their *own* tests instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the authors who wrote the FraMoTEC paper also wrote [his thesis on FraMoTEC](http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/25590/58121/1/scs-thorarensen2016-thesis.pdf), and indirectly critiqued the Lovelace Test 2.0 and other similar such tests:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Piaget-MacGyver Room problem [Bringsjord and Licato, 2012], Lovelace Test 2.0 [Riedl, 2014] and Toy Box problem [Johnston, 2010] all come with the caveat of being defined very vaguely — these evaluation methods may be likely to come up with a reasonable evaluation for intelligence, but it is very difficult to compare two different agents (or controllers) that partake in the their own domain-specific evaluations, which is what frequently happens when agents are tailored to pass specific evaluations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another major issue with the Lovelace Test 2.0 is that there is a proliferation of *other* tests to &quot;measure&quot; the creativity of AI. [Evaluating Evaluation: Assessing Progress in Computational Creativity Research](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/42374/1/jordanous-2011a.pdf), published by &#xD;&#xA;Anna Jordanous in 2011 (3 years *before* the invention of the Lovelace Test 2.0) analyzed research papers about AI creativity and wrote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Of the 18 papers that applied creativity evaluation methodologies to evaluate their system’s creativity, no one methodology emerged as standard across the community. Colton’s creative tripod framework ([Colton 2008](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd8b/d5bb76c94c4bfc34cb1fa244dc6bd4a8ca8e.pdf)) was used most often (6 uses), with 4 papers using Ritchie’s empirical criteria ([Ritchie 2007](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06d8/3be9078b5c8933c3523f0e663fff1c61e3a0.pdf)). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That leaves *10* papers with miscellaneous creativity evaluation methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal of &quot;Evaluating Evaluation&quot; was to standardize the process of evaluating creativity, to avoid the possibility of the field stagnating due to the proliferation of so many creativity tests.  Anna Jordanous still remained interested in evaluating creativity tests, publishing articles such as [&quot;Stepping Back to Progress Forwards: Setting Standards for Meta-Evaluation of Computational Creativity&quot;](http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/34328583/Stepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards-_Setting_Standards_for_Meta-Evaluation_of_Computational_Creativity.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1475893195&amp;Signature=ox0%2FOEkNUNjz5pQg0w%2FOgzHPCsM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DStepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards_Setti.pdf) and [Four PPPPerspectives on Computational Creativity](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~map01mm/CC2015/AISB-CC2015-Proceedings.pdf#page=18).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Evaluating Evaluation&quot; does provide some commentary to explain the proliferation of systems to evaluate creativity:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Evaluation standards are not easy to define. It is difficult to evaluate creativity and even more difficult to describe how we evaluate creativity, in human creativity as well as in computational creativity. In fact, even the very definition of creativity is problematic (Plucker, Beghetto, and Dow 2004). It is hard to identify what ’being creative’ entails, so there are no benchmarks or ground truths to measure against.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that so many tests of creativity already exist (to the extent that Jordanous can make an academic career in studying them) means that it's very difficult for any new test (such as the Lovelace Test 2.0) to even be noticed (much less cited). Why would you want to use something like the Lovelace Test 2.0 when there's so many other tests you could use instead?" />

The definition of life in biological terms is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter where the distinguishing criteria are the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Does artificial intelligence &quot;grow&quot;?  Indeed, I can program a machine learning program to grow with every input taken in.  In the loosest sense, we can say that artificial intelligence does grow, but does it biologically? If we look at the definition for growth of a living thing, it means to undergo natural development by increasing in size and changing physically or the progress to maturity.  All living organisms undergo growth.   Even though at the simplest level, cells are a series of chemical processes, cells are a very complicated set of chemical processes that are still not fully understood by scientists across the world.  Every cell has genetic material that can be replicated, excised, used for RNA, proteins, and that is subject to epigenetic regulation. &#xD;&#xA;[![Cell division][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does artificial intelligence undergo the same process of cell division?  No.  If I wanted to, I could write a program that undergoes a simple for-loop (print i from 1 to 100), replicates itself at a certain point (i=50) to produce the same program perhaps with some variation that will execute itself, and terminates (dies) at the end of the for loop.  The program, by an extremely loose definition supported by philosophy but not by biology, lives.  However, in scientific terms (and the correct interpretation), artificial intelligence is not living.  Artificial intelligence can be seen to be similar to viruses which are considered to be acellular and essential to life but not living.  Viruses are encapsulated DNA and RNA that undergo processes of growth, reproduction, and functionality but because they lack the ability to undergo the cell division cycle, are considered non-living.  At the very basis of the scientific definition of life is the cell replication cycle.  Artificial intelligence and viruses are not able to undergo the cell cycle.  Viruses need to infect other cells in order to reproduce but do not have their own, autonomous cycle.  At the end of the day, if you can argue that viruses are alive, you can argue that artificial intelligence is alive as well.  For the scientific definition of life, artificial intelligence must undergo the process of cell division and replication.  Even though artificial intelligence can mimic and help sustain life, no artificial intelligence process is truly alive. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do note I did not discuss [living systems][2] in my answer.          &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Definition of life][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.isss.org/primer/asem14ep.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21685/" />

Not every practical problem can be rephrased in terms of classification. Classification domain needs to be known upfront. Although the classification can be applied to any type of data, it's necessary to train the NN with samples of the specific domain where it'll be applied. If the domain is switched at some point, while keeping the same model (NN structure), it'll have to be retrained with new samples. Furthermore, even the best classifiers have &quot;gaps&quot; - [Adversarial Examples](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/07/deep-learning-adversarial-examples-misconceptions.html) can be easily constructed from a training sample, such that changes are imperceptible to human, but are misclassified by the trained model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

If there is a confusion about a certain aspect to intelligence, you haven't broken it down enough (in my experience)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have managed to break it down very far and very deep.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best part of finishing breaking it down, was that I did not have to worry about breaking down spoken language intelligence, as that is already well-successfully accomplished and there are APIs out there in which computational creativity researchers can use such as [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, we *only* have to worry about breaking down the creativity aspect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When beginning my development for the Artificial Intelligence at the age of 18 (hence the reason, not having high-educational knowledge of the field before today), I had just come out of high school with knowledge of how the design process works as an engineer, which I acquired from taking engineer courses in high (secondary) school. I also brought with me my own knowledge that I developed personally as a hobbyist programmer on browser-based integrated developer environments (to all non-programmers: here is a [google search on IDEs](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+integrated+development+environment) and [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where I got most of my knowledge from, so again, I am sorry community users for my incompetent lack of citations&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The Design Process:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**NOTE:** This I could easily provide a citation for, however it has too many accepted descriptions for me to be willing to cite one and to say that it is *the* or *a correct citation*. However, I will be providing one as a reference and that is the one provided very nicely on [DiscoverDesign](https://www.discoverdesign.org/handbook)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The steps are *Define the Problem*, *Collect Information*, *Brainstorm and Analyze Ideas*, *Develop Solutions*, *Get Some Sort of Feedback*, *Improve* (which is essentially restart the process)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Defining a problem and How Curiosity works:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Defining the problem has a really easy solution (algorithm): ask for that from the client that you are designing for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this process could easily be made more interesting: Define *a problem* without user input. Essentially how will it come up with ideas or more specifically recognize problems on its own?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did some digging, and that relies on one question that lacks enough research for a **solid** answer, and that is where do questions come from psychologically?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More specifically, how does curiosity work? With more research on Google I was led to [this article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm) specifically addressing that question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are *drive theory* and *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drive Theory simply states, we have a *need* to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions. So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Incongruity Theory* states that we are able identify things we *do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL* which leads us to asking questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a *missing/unclear attribute or characteristic* on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand). The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is by your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously looking at *similar ideas*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what I have designed is fairly simple. An idea is represented programmatically as an *object*. That object has certain characteristics known as *properties* (and essentially methods, but primarily and heavily-primarily properties). The program reads over those properties and finds other objects *similar* to it based on those properties. It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object *does not have*, and therefore marks those properties as unknown, making it possible to apply *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Collecting Information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This process is already achieved with *machine learning*, any questions on this topic need to be addressed to the [machine-learning tag](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Brainstorm Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Analyze Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to *induce* whether an idea is feasible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Develop Solutions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where my IDE knowledge comes in handy. In order to make product development *easy and understandable* to an AI, which is essentially a program, we would have to start by teaching it to develop program products soly, just to see how well the other algorithms work, considering that it only has to write in a program language, and program language rules are straight forward. and *very consistent* in comparison to spoken/written languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in order to do this it has to understand how to write a program. The most essential skill a computer program can have and needs to write a program is not a *dictionary of programming terms, functions, and commands*, but rather *knowledge of the syntactical rules* for a programming language. Which this technology is pretty much already available in IDE tech, and it is known as *syntactical highlighting*. All that would have to be done is to re-purpose it from *highlighting* to *assisting with writing*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Get Some Sort of Feedback.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is essentially the same as analyzing the ideas, but now we would be using algorithms to analyze the final physical product as opposed to conceptual ideas." />

However, I will be providing one as a reference and that is the one provided very nicely on [DiscoverDesign](https://www.discoverdesign.org/handbook).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The paragraph below is provided by them, and if you are interested in breaking that process down more, DiscoverDesign fully explains the processes in detail for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The steps are *Define the Problem*, *Collect Information*, *Brainstorm and Analyze Ideas*, *Develop Solutions*, *Get Some Sort of Feedback*, *Improve* (which is essentially restart the process)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Defining a problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as this part of the breakdown goes, there two algorithms in which you can use for this subprocess of design:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Easy Algorithm (not really an algorithm):* ask from the client what the Artificial Intelligence is providing a solution for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this process could easily be made more interesting:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Difficult Algorithm*: design an algorithm that can define *a problem* without user input.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did some digging, and the design of the latter relies on one question that lacks enough research for a **solid** answer, and that is *where do questions come from psychologically*? or *more specifically, how does curiosity work*?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With more research on Google I was led to [this article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm) specifically addressing that question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###How Curiosity works:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are *drive theory* and *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Drive Theory simply states, we have a *need* to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Incongruity Theory* states that we are able identify things we *do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL* which leads us to asking questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a *missing/unclear attribute or characteristic* on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###My Own Inductive Theory on Curiousity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is that your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously looking at *other similar ideas* and looking at *their __clear__ attributes*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Solution Based on the Theory:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what I have designed is fairly simple:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ***An idea*** is *represented programmatically as an __object__*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *The object* has certain characteristics known as *properties* (which are thos attributes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The program reads over those properties and finds other objects *similar* to it based on those properties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object *does not have*, and therefore marks those properties as unknown, making it possible to apply *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Collecting Information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This process is already achieved with *machine learning*, any questions on this topic need to be addressed to the [machine-learning tag](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Brainstorm Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Analyze Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to *induce* whether an idea is feasible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Develop Solutions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where IDE-development knowledge comes in handy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*In order to make product development* ***easy and understandable*** *to an AI*, we have to choose a type of product that could be developed **easily**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Editor's Note:* I do recommend this in order to keep the testing of the algorithms for the previous processes really simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Easily Designed Product that I Selected for Designing an Algorithm:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I am providing this to you, so you can model a way to reproduce this process for the Intelligence you would like to build.

However, I will be providing one as a reference and that is the one provided very nicely on [DiscoverDesign](https://www.discoverdesign.org/handbook).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The paragraph below is provided by them, and if you are interested in breaking that process down more, DiscoverDesign fully explains the processes in detail for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The steps are *Define the Problem*, *Collect Information*, *Brainstorm and Analyze Ideas*, *Develop Solutions*, *Get Some Sort of Feedback*, *Improve* (which is essentially restart the process)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Defining a problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as this part of the breakdown goes, there two algorithms in which you can use for this subprocess of design:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Easy Algorithm (not really an algorithm):* ask from the client what the Artificial Intelligence is providing a solution for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this process could easily be made more interesting:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Difficult Algorithm*: design an algorithm that can define *a problem* without user input.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did some digging, and the design of the latter relies on one question that lacks enough research for a **solid** answer, and that is *where do questions come from psychologically*? or *more specifically, how does curiosity work*?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With more research on Google I was led to [this article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm) specifically addressing that question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###How Curiosity works:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are *drive theory* and *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Drive Theory simply states, we have a *need* to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Incongruity Theory* states that we are able identify things we *do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL* which leads us to asking questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a *missing/unclear attribute or characteristic* on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###My Own Inductive Theory on Curiousity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is that your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously is looking at *other similar ideas* and looking at *their __clear__ and __concisely known__ attributes*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Solution Based on the Theory:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what I have designed is fairly simple:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ***An idea*** is *represented programmatically as an __object__*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *The object* has certain characteristics known as *properties* (which are those attributes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The program reads over those properties and finds other objects *similar* to it based on those properties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object *does not have*, and therefore marks those properties as unknown on the original object, making it possible to apply *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Collecting Information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This process is already achieved with *machine learning*, any questions on this subprocess of design need to be addressed to the [machine-learning tag](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Brainstorming Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Analyzing Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to *induce* whether an idea is feasible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Developing Solutions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where IDE-development knowledge comes in handy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*In order to make product development* ***easy and understandable*** *to an AI*, we have to choose a type of product that could be developed **easily**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Editor's Note:* I do recommend this in order to keep the testing of the algorithms for the previous processes really simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Easily Designed Product that I Selected for Designing an Algorithm:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I am providing this to you, so you can model a way to reproduce this process for the Intelligence you would like to build. So, I only hope that you do not intend on copying it, but my artificial intelligence project is free and open-source, so there is no issue, if you do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Considering that written programs are very easy products to develop fully, and Considering that program language rules are straight forward. and *very consistent* in comparison to spoken/written languages, I chose to have it develop *programs*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in order to do this it has to understand how to write a program. The most essential skill a computer programmer can have and needs to write a program is not a *dictionary of programming terms, functions, and commands*, but rather *knowledge of the syntactical rules* for a programming language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The technological solution to this is pretty much already available in IDE tech, and it is known as *syntactical highlighting*. All that would have to be done is to re-purpose it from *highlighting* to *assisting with writing*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Getting Some Sort of Feedback.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is essentially the same as analyzing the ideas, but now we would be using algorithms to analyze the final physical product as opposed to conceptual ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Afterword Notes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am designing and researching into *computational creativity*, and I do want to mention that I just discovered this field of research is a thing by looking up the name [Mike Cook](https://live.newscientist.com/mike-cook/) on the internet, and that in order for me to help you, my answer does require lengthiness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paragraph 3 of the page found there [Mike Cook link] (listed at the time of 10/13/2016 at 8:28pm Arizona (USA) Time) that Mike Cook specializes in [computational creativity](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2LG2rNnPAhUQ82MKHcg0AgkQFggvMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.computationalcreativity.net%2Ficcc2016%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK9E_tYBriAStd7HsIBjcf1KvQLg&amp;sig2=PD6wgisDW5YU3-224YGVYQ)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With further research this term was coined by the [ICCC 2016](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2LG2rNnPAhUQ82MKHcg0AgkQFggvMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.computationalcreativity.net%2Ficcc2016%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK9E_tYBriAStd7HsIBjcf1KvQLg&amp;sig2=PD6wgisDW5YU3-224YGVYQ) according to [this google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=computational+creativity&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS700US700&amp;oq=computat&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3974j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) made by myself at that time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, google did not further provide me with any products actually being made within this field of research, so I would therefore like to discuss mine as it is open-source under a MIT-license.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Note to Community:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do want to make clear that I am providing this answer out of helpfulness, and I do understand that it has no credibility, as the product I am using (as an example) is my own.

It could profile users to see ehat tasks are done most often, how many steps are needed.  Then when it recognizes that task recurring, it could ask the user if they wanted it to execute a macro that did the following [then it presents then with a list of the steps, allowing them to edit as needed].  Then it executes the 'macro' that it learned from observing the user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another use of AI is error detection, not only in the software, but in user error when the software was used inefficiently, redundantly, or improperly.  If the software were designed such that it was given a set of models of user tasks (like AI plans), it could observe users in the way they achieve known tasks, and offer suggestions or ask for confirmation that imminent unusual outcomes are intended.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And of course, AI could be used extensively in user interface design, on devices, web sites, or apps.

As conversations with apps that can add their own data and models of tasks/concepts/domains develop further, the need for AI *inside* the app will only grow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a *ton* of ways that AI could be used in apps.  A few of these have started to arise in mobile devices and their apps, usually in fusion of user mobility with external web-based databases (e.g. GPS and maps), but IMO it's been slow." />

Decision trees usually works well in a turn-based game with a good heuristic function, but in RTS games takes a different approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of a very complex RTS game, one could implemented a rule-based AI. For example&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - given it is the early game use all units to scout for resources&#xD;&#xA; - if a certain criteria is met build the base a certain way&#xD;&#xA; - if another criteria is met build an army&#xD;&#xA; - if the army is big enough, attack&#xD;&#xA; - if being attacked by the enemy, bring the units back to the base to defend&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each of these rules could implement various other AI technique, for example use A-star to find the optimal path between a unit's current location and destination.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further optimization could be done by &quot;grouping&quot; similar units to act like one unit. e.g. calculate the path for the entire group instead of each individual unit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could also add finer grained rules, like if enemy is a certain distance from a unit, move closer and attack or retreat to the base (depending on health, ammo, abilities, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The benefit of this approach is that a rule-based system executes very fast as no training or decision trees are necessary and this frees up a lot of system resources for visuals like physics and graphics.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The disadvantage is that if the rule system is not complex enough, the player will easily recognize the pattern and the game will become predictable and boring.  You will also notice that the more different units you add to the game, the exponentially more complex the rule system becomes as you have to cater and test interaction between each type of unit in the game otherwise players might find a weakness in the game design and exploit to complete missions in ways it was not designed to be completed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the reasons why multi-player games are so popular is that you do not play against set rules, but against creative people who have the ability to comes up with new strategies you had never seen before." />

For a human, there are basically three computations: `r1 = x*x`, `r2 = r1 + 1`, `r3 = sin(r2)`. Even if you have 3 people working on calculating the result, you will not be faster than the single fastest person in this group is. Why? Because you need the results of the last computation. " />

The GAN learns by passing the loss function to both networks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How do the discriminative (D) neural nets initially know whether the data produced by G is correct or not? Do we have to train the D first then add it into the GAN with G?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's consider my trained D net, which can classify a picture with 90% percentage accuracy. If we add this D net to a GAN there is a 10% probability it will classify a image wrong. If we train a GAN with this D net then will it also have the same 10% error in classifying an image?

Keep in mind that this only answers the part of the question pertaining to NTMs, not Google DeepMind itself, plus I'm still learning the ropes in machine learning, so some of the material in these papers is over my head; I did manage to grasp much of the material in [Graves et al.'s original paper][1]{1] though and am close to having homegrown NTM code to test. I also at least skimmed the following papers over the last few months; they do not replicate the NTM study in a strict scientific manner, but many of their experimental results do tend to support the original at least tangentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• In [this paper][2] on a variant version of NTM addressing, Gulcehere, et al. do not try to precisely replicate Graves et al.'s tests, but like the DeepMind team, it does demonstrate markedly better results for the original NTM and several variants over an ordinary recurrent LSTM. They use 10,000 training samples of a Facebook Q&amp;A dataset, rather than the N-grams Graves et al. operated on in their paper, so it's not replication in the strictest sense. They did however manage to get a version of the original NTM and several variants up and running, plus recorded the same magnitude of performance improvement.[2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• Unlike the original NTM, [this study][3] tested a version of reinforcement learning which was not differentiable; that may be why they were unable to solve several of the programming-like tasts, like Repeat-Copy, unless the controller wasn't confined to moving forwards. Their results were nevertheless good enough to lend support to the idea of NTMs. A more recent revision of their paper is apparently available, which I have yet to read, so perhaps some of their variant's problems have been solved.[3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• Instead of testing the original flavor of NTM against ordinary neural nets like LSTMs, [this paper][4] pitted it against several more advanced NTM memory structures. They got good results on the same type of programming-like tasks that Graves et al. tested, but I don't think they were using the same dataset (it's hard to tell from the way their study is written just what datasets they were operating on).[4] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• On p. 8 of [this study][5], an NTM clearly outperforms several LSTM, feed-forward and nearest-neighbor based schemes on an Omniglot character recognition dataset. An alternative approach to external memory cooked up by the authors clearly beats it, but it still obviously performs well. The authors seem to belong to a rival team at Google, so that might be an issue when assessing replicability.[5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• On p. 2 [these authors][6] reported getting better generalization on &quot;very large sequences&quot; in a test of copy tasks, using a much smaller NTM network they evolved with the genetic NEAT algorithm, which dynamically grows topologies.[6]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NTMs are fairly new so there hasn't been much time to stringently replicate the original research yet, I suppose. The handful of papers I skimmed over the summer, however, seem to lend support to their experimental results; I have yet to see any that report anything but excellent performance.

Lets assume, for the sake of argument, that this claim is correct (you may think the claim is to vague to even qualify for being correct, that it's &quot;not even false&quot;. If so, I would love to hear your ways of fleshing out the claim in such a way that it's specific enough to be true or false). Then, since arguably at least chronologically in our evolution, most of our higher level cognitive capabilities come after our brain's way of processing sensorimotor information, this brings up the question what it is about the way that our brains function that make them particularly suitable for the processing of sensorimotor information? What makes our brains'  architecture particularly suitable for being an information processing unit inside a body? This is my first question. And what I'm hoping for are answers that go beyond the *a fortiori* reply &quot;Our brain is so powerful and dynamic, it's great for *any* task, and so also for processing sensorimotor information&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My second question is basically the same but instead of the human brain I want to ask for neural networks. What are the properties of neural networks that makes them *particularly* suitable for processing the kind of information that is produced by a body? Here are some of the reasons why people think neural networks are powerful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The universal approximation theorem (of FFNNs)&#xD;&#xA; - their ability to learn and self-organise&#xD;&#xA; - Robustness to local degrading of information&#xD;&#xA; - their ability to abstract/coarse-grain/convolute features, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I see how these are real advantages when it comes to evolution picking its favorite model for an embodied AI, none of them (or their combination) seems to be unique to neural networks. So they don't provide a satisfactory answer to my question. What makes a neural network a more suitable structure for embodied AI than, say, having a literal Turing machine sitting inside our head, or any other structure that is capable of universal computation? For instance, I really don't see how neural networks would be a particularly natural choice for dealing with geometric information. But geometric information is pretty vital when it comes to sensorimotor information, no?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking forward to your answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

In future if we reach to a certain technological level where mortal beings were only part of history, then the definition will drop **this** parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Coming to the second question. AI started as field of study to make machines to think like humans (or take rational decisions). Giving life to machines was, or is, not a concern of AI developers (at-least not nowadays). Once I watched some videos of Michio Kaku, where he talked about consciousness along with AI.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose human has a conscious level of 10. Then a thermostat might have the conscious level of 1 as it can sense when the surrounding is hot or cold and then take decision. Similarly a rat can have a conscious level 7 (or something). And the levels are of exponential order (not a linear scale). Similarly you can develop an AI program and check what level of consciousness it has achieved. Then you can decide whether it is living or not. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) will have a lower level of consciousness level than AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) will have consciousness level higher than the other two, and way higher than any human being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;To judge whether an AI program is living or not you need a concrete definition of **&quot;LIFE&quot;**.

If you ask why that makes them powerful, well, that's just the structure of the world. If you are stalked by a wolf, it's not like its upper jaw will attack you frontally, while his lower jaw will attack you from behind. If you want to respond to the threat with a feasible computational effort, you'll have to treat the wolf as one entity. Providing these kinds of entities or concepts from the raw bits and bytes of input is what a hierarchical representation does. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this is quite intuitive for sensory information: lashes, iris, eyebrow make up an eye, eyes, nose and mouth make up a face and so on. What is less obvious, is the fact that motor control works exactly the same way! Only in reverse. If you want to lift your arm, you'll just lift it. But for your brain to actually realise this move, the high level command has to be broken down into precise signals for every muscle involved. And this is done by propagating the command down the hierarchy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the brain these two functions are strongly intertwined. You use constant sensory feedback to adapt your motor control and in many cases you'd be incapable of integrating your stream of sensory data into a coherent representation if you didn't have the additional information of what your body is doing to change that stream of data. [Saccades][1] are a good example for that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course this doesn't mean that our cognitive functions are dependent on the processing of sensorimotor information. I would be surprised if a pure thinking machine wouldn't be possible. There is however a specific version of this &quot;embodied intelligence hypothesis&quot; that sounds plausible to me: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Creating high level cognitive concepts with unsupervised learning is a really difficult problem. Creating high level motor representation might be significantly easier. The reason is that there is more immediate useful feedback. I have been thinking about how to provide a scaffolding for the learning of a hierarchy of cognitive concepts and one thing I could imagine is that high level cognitive concepts basically hitch a ride with the motor concepts. Just think of what a pantomime can express with movement alone. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" />

Text="There is this claim around that the brain's cognitive capabilities are tightly linked to the way it processes sensorimotor information and that, in this or a similar sense, our intelligence is &quot;embodied&quot;. Lets assume, for the sake of argument, that this claim is correct (you may think the claim is too vague to even qualify for being correct, that it's &quot;not even false&quot;. If so, I would love to hear your ways of fleshing out the claim in such a way that it's specific enough to be true or false). Then, since arguably at least chronologically in our evolution, most of our higher level cognitive capabilities come after our brain's way of processing sensorimotor information, this brings up the question what it is about the way that our brains function that make them particularly suitable for the processing of sensorimotor information? What makes our brains'  architecture particularly suitable for being an information processing unit inside a body? This is my first question. And what I'm hoping for are answers that go beyond the *a fortiori* reply &quot;Our brain is so powerful and dynamic, it's great for *any* task, and so also for processing sensorimotor information&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My second question is basically the same but instead of the human brain I want to ask for neural networks. What are the properties of neural networks that makes them *particularly* suitable for processing the kind of information that is produced by a body? Here are some of the reasons why people think neural networks are powerful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The universal approximation theorem (of FFNNs)&#xD;&#xA; - their ability to learn and self-organise&#xD;&#xA; - Robustness to local degrading of information&#xD;&#xA; - their ability to abstract/coarse-grain/convolute features, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I see how these are real advantages when it comes to evolution picking its favorite model for an embodied AI, none of them (or their combination) seems to be unique to neural networks. So they don't provide a satisfactory answer to my question. What makes a neural network a more suitable structure for embodied AI than, say, having a literal Turing machine sitting inside our head, or any other structure that is capable of universal computation? For instance, I really don't see how neural networks would be a particularly natural choice for dealing with geometric information. But geometric information is pretty vital when it comes to sensorimotor information, no?" />

If having one light-sensitive cell connected to one muscle cell makes an organism more likely to survive, then you have the building blocks to add a second layer without inventing any new sorts of cells, because you already have the information-processing connector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Neural networks are convenient for evolution because their organization matches the hierarchical nature of the problem *and* the same kind of cell is used everywhere. All you need is dendrites to receive signals, a way to compute the threshold and trigger if the received signal is higher, axons that can make it to other cells, and then branches at the end of the axon to serve as multipliers. You can arbitrarily extend the depth and breadth of the network just by adding more cells.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Neural networks are convenient for artificial sensorimotor control because they give you, in memory, access to lots of intermediate values. They're also convenient for the same reasons evolution found them convenient--we can just say what we expect the structure of the robotic control will look like, provide training data, and then eventually have a robot that works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But there's lots of robotics where the control system is designed instead of learned. To take a very simple example, one *could* use machine learning on the thermostat problem, to learn what temperatures require the heater to be turned on and what temperatures require the air conditioner to be turned on. But this would be extra work *and* a less robust system than just designing the optimal control system ahead of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In control theory, there's a concept called [adaptive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control), where one of the state space parameters for the control system is a property of the system. For example, imagine a satellite; typically we think of the state space of the system as the position and velocity of the satellite in three dimensions, so six total coordinates. There's then a set of differential equations that describe how the satellite will move over time, and what would happen if we used the actuators on the satellite to change its velocity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But part of those differential equations is the inertia of the satellite. That is, how much fuel we need to expend and how it'll affect the rotation and translation of the satellite depends on where the weight of the satellite is located. And this can change over time, as fuel is consumed or if it wasn't correctly measured to begin with. Adaptive control adds new states to the system to track the inertia, and then simultaneously updates its estimate of the inertia and uses that estimate to plan what controls are necessary to move to a desired position.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could imagine solving this problem with neural networks, but we can fairly easily calculate the optimal solution from first principles. In that case, we don't need neural network-based control, but the end result will look something like it from the outside." />

Of course, thinking that I can apply the techniques above easily in my scenarios was stupid. All examples above are based on convolutional nets (image recognition) and some other assumptions, which might not be applicable in my scenarios.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can you give me hints or futher articles, which deal with my questions below? As a beginner, I do not have an overview, yet. Preferably, your suggestions should also be connected to the following areas already: deep learning, reinforcement learning (, multiagent systems)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(1)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a card game and the AI shall play a card from its hand, you could think about the cards (amongst other stuff) as the current game state. You can easily define some sort of neural net and feed it with the card data. In a trivial case the cards are just numbered. I do not know the net type, which would be suitable, but I guess deep reinforcment learning strategies could be applied easily then.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I can only imagine this, if there is a constant number of hand cards. In the examples above, the number of pixels is also constant, for example. What if a player can have a different numbers of cards? What to do, if a player can have an infinite number of cards? Of course, this is just a theoretical question as no game has an infinite number of cards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the initial examples, the action space is constant. What can you do, if the action space is not? This more or less follows from my previous problem. If you have 3 cards, you can play card 1, 2 or 3. If you have 5 cards, you can play card 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, etc. It is also common in card games, that it is not allowed to play a card. Could this be tackled with negative reward?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, which &quot;tricks&quot; can be used, e.g. always assume a constant number of cards with &quot;filling values&quot;, which is only applicable in the non-infinite case (anyways unrealistic and even humans could not play well with that)?&#xD;&#xA;Are there articles, which examine such things already?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05521&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08779.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/" />

Text="**AlphaGo** is the most sophisticated and closet human creation towards an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It is a computer program that is **developed by Google DeepMind** to play the board game &quot;Go&quot;. The game is different than other games, as **The number of potential legal board positions is greater than the number of atoms in the universe**. It has way more legal board positions than the chess. So, _AlphaGo_ requires different technique for it's development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Program's victories against the best players in the world in March 2016 **is considered a major break through** in the field of AI. Go was previously considered to be a hard problem and many experts believed that current technology is not enough. Experts were saying that it will take atleast 5 years (or may be 10 years) before we will have a well developed Go software player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;The game used sophisticated algorithms of deep learning and reinforcement learning in order to learn the game. What makes this game different from other board game (like Chess, Reversi, etc.) is that moves are often based on intuition. If you ask a Chess player why he make a certain move, you will always be hearing an answer where he will explain you how he thought this move can increase in change of winning. Every move uses certain heuristics, strategy and/ or tricks. This is not the case with Go. Some moves are often taken because of intuition. Coding an AI software that can play a game, where intuition is a integral part of the game makes it different from other AIs that we have today.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; At present AlphaGo is the closest AI software to Artificial General Intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can go through these links for more information:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

Rather than tying itself into moral and ethical knots in a crisis, Mercedes-Benz simply intends to program its self-driving cars to save the people inside the car. Every time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; All of Mercedes-Benz’s future Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous cars will prioritize saving the people they carry, according to Christoph von Hugo, the automaker’s manager of driver assistance systems and active safety.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There article also contains the following fascinating paragraph.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A study released at midyear [by Science][2] magazine didn’t clear the air, either. The majority of the 1928 people surveyed thought it would be ethically better for autonomous cars to sacrifice their occupants rather than crash into pedestrians. Yet the majority also said they wouldn’t buy autonomous cars if the car prioritized pedestrian safety over their own.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://blog.caranddriver.com/self-driving-mercedes-will-prioritize-occupant-safety-over-pedestrians/&#xD;&#xA;[2]: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6293/1514" />

If we want to know if a new sample belongs to class A or B, we will compare it to each model and decide. The advantage is that we are able to synthetically generate more samples of these classes using the generative property of the model. The models have a &quot;global knowledge&quot; of what the classes are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, a discriminative model will &quot;pay attention&quot; to what differentiates the 2 classes. It is more straightforward and often computationally less expensive as the model does not need to grasp everything about each class but only what makes them different.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is for the big picture.

An so we consult the grammar rule book, and settle for the meaning ( indefinite article any one of ), you have to parse the next word  and refer to it though, but let's gloss over that for now, and finally (**triumph**) a noun ( it could also be a verb, but thanks to the grammar rule book we settled for a noun with meaning: ( victory,conquest), so in the end we have ( joining the meanings ):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A specific thing occurred of victory.** Close enough and I am glossing over a few other rules, but that's not the point, the other strategy is:&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A lexical dictionary (or lexicon)**&#xD;&#xA;Where words or sounds are associated with specific meaning. Here meaning is derived from one or more words or sounds as a unit. This introduces the problem to a parser, since well, it shouldn't parse anything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;E.G. ***&quot;Non Plus Ultra&quot;*** And so the AI parser would recognize that this phrase is not to be parsed and instead matched with meaning :&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The highest point or culmination&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lexical units introduce another issue in that they themselves could be part of the first example, and so you end up with recursion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; if it is possible for a computer to parse a well-versed sentence written in English as if it were parsed by an adult English-speaking human?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe it could be possible, most examples I've seen deal effectively with the grammar rule book or the lexicon part, but I am not aware of a combination of both, but in terms of programming, it could happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately even if you solve this problem, your AI would not really understand things in the strict sense, but rather present you with very elaborate synonyms, additionally context (as mentioned in the comments) plays a role into the grammar and lexicon strategies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;If it cannot be represented using simple grammar rules, what kind of semantic structure can be used to generalize it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A mixed one where there are both grammar rules and a lexicon and both can change and be influenced based on the AI specific context and experience as well as a system for dealing with these objects could be one way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;  " />

For example, development of human-like natural language processing (NLP) is necessary for intelligent agent to pass any verbal tests, or even non-verbal tests that requires processing of sentences of human language. Famous test that tests intelligence by asking questions in natural language and expects answers in the same form is Turing test. NLP still struggles with many (basic) human skills like listening, speaking, parsing and forming sentences. No one knows when we'll have system that can do these things as good as human. Since this system is crucial, but also far from human-like it's likely cause of delay in developing AI that passes intelligence test. Are these problems AI-hard? Do we need to develop strong AI to solve them?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can look at speech and listening as interfaces used for expressing and affecting inner processes of human brain. Same goes for other senses like eyesight which is being approximated by computer vision. One could say that we only need to develop convincing mimics of human senses and incorporate them in one big system that will become first human-like AI. That is the minimum requirement. **I doubt this will be achieved in this century.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Other thoughts)&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;What truly defines intelligence is brain activity. Since it's really complex and one artificial neuron is not equal to one neuron in brain, increase in computation power will not necessarily help achieving human-like AI. Also recognizing such system by mere intelligence test is questionable. For now it's only philosophical discussion but by the time we are able to design such machine I think we'll also have better understanding of human brain. Someone in 2100 might not read this answer on quantum computer with integrated AI OS powered from fusion reactor in his self-flying car, but will probably have many systems that help him in everyday tasks far more than we imagine today." />

Also it can keep information of time and context in which it was said, like timestamp of an article, some proper nouns that can indicate place (XY conference, London...). Now, suspicious article can be compared and checked if it matches time, place, some context and contains quote that is similar.

Their currently most successful approach does the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Detect parts of the ink that are candidates of being a character&#xD;&#xA; - Use a FeedForward Neural Network to do character recognition on those candidates&#xD;&#xA; - Use beam search and a language model to find most the most likely combination of results that results into a word&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Their second approach is using an LSTM end-to-end.

[Artificial neural networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) typically use exemplar data as inputs for the purpose of training, or adjusting the weights of its internal connections, to accurately correctly classify them within a certain error range. The network is then applied to unknown data to classify it. [Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection) filters are just blind operators that transform input data regardless of how it can be classified. There is no training, so any intelligence exists only in the mind of the filter developer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. A CNN could be trained to be an effective Sobel (edge detection) filter, as described [in this paper](http://www.worldacademicunion.com/journal/1746-7659JIC/jicvol5no1paper01.pdf), but a Sobel filter couldn't be an effective learning algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Training neural networks is more non-deterministic, with outputs depending on what data they are trained with and potentially even the operational computations that are used for classification. Applying filters is typically deterministic, i.e. they will transform the same data exactly the same way if applied twice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One short way of expressing the biggest difference is: a cellular neural network is looking for a function, while a Sobel filter *is* a function.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there are types of neural networks called Convolutional Neural Networks, which can use Sobel and other filters in their input layers, as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). Though, these are neither of the things you are asking about. :)" />

Apply the found solutions to the issue&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an example is here the problem of marketing a shopping mall: A Shopping mall has many rooms and floors (1). A museum has also many rooms and floors (2). How are museums marketed? They present many pictures or sculptures (3). We could use our rooms and floors to decorate them with pictures and sculptures (4).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course the idea to implement that as an artifically intelligent algorithm was not far. However, I feel a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of methods that exist out there. Neural Networks, Bayesian Interference and so on... My current experience doesn't go further than simple machine learning like kMeans-Clustering for example. Do you think it would be very hard to find a solution for this problem? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm thinking of a console application, where you can enter a conceptualized problem like &quot;methods for creative writing&quot;, for example, and it uses the above method to find possible solutions of the issue. Of course no solution with extensive depth, more something like basic ideas derived from the knowledge database I have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lets take as an example a console application where someone asks &quot;how to write a novel&quot;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. It should find out first that the system all is about is in the term &quot;novel&quot;. To find a feature of that system it just searches concepts containing that term: it finds out &quot;Novel is a story&quot; So thats a feature.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Which systems are also stories? A good concept it should find is e.g. &quot;Plot is a story&quot;. (Of course only when I am selecting the search results manually)--&gt; **How to find best concepts of a list when not knowing which fits best?**&#xD;&#xA; 3. It should then find out that a plot is written using a storyline: &quot;storyline is a plot&quot;&#xD;&#xA; 4. One possible answer of the AI would in this case be: &quot;By writing a storyline&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you know some helpful libraries, algorithms or other resources that might help me?

[Artificial neural networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) typically use exemplar data as inputs for the purpose of training, or adjusting the weights of its internal connections, to accurately classify them within a certain error range. The network is then applied to unknown data to classify them. [Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection) filters are just blind operators that transform input data regardless of how it can be classified. There is no training, so any intelligence exists only in the mind of the filter developer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. A CNN could be trained to be an effective Sobel (edge detection) filter, as described [in this paper](http://www.worldacademicunion.com/journal/1746-7659JIC/jicvol5no1paper01.pdf), but a Sobel filter couldn't be an effective learning algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Training neural networks is more non-deterministic, with outputs depending on what data they are trained with and potentially even the operational computations that are used for classification. Applying filters is typically deterministic, i.e. they will transform the same data exactly the same way if applied twice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One succinct way of expressing the biggest difference is: a cellular neural network is looking for a function, while a Sobel filter *is* a function.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there are types of neural networks called Convolutional Neural Networks, which can use Sobel and other filters in their input layers, as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network).

The minimum hardwired check is to make sure that signals generated inside a mind are not misidentified as coming from outside (aka &quot;I hear voices&quot;). That's all. This is where the blockchain of truth begins and where it ends.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An Internet article? The input to AI is rather: one of AI's network interfaces received many bytes. Once it's verified they are from the network, and not imaginary, they cannot be unreal or untrue in any meaningful way. By that definition of input, it is in fact the *only* thing we can be sure is true and real.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course AI will likely form hypotheses regarding these bytes that happen to contain ASCII strings like &quot;Trump&quot;, &quot;John Smith&quot;, &quot;ice balls on Siberian beaches&quot;.

That *belief* is a synonym of &quot;tired with trying new hypotheses, will stick to this one&quot;. Typical human thing. AI will have less of that, I hope, due to having much much more processing capabilities. AI will stick less to the high-school-level truth that you should assign great credibility to statements written in a form of a newspaper article, it will hopefully form more and more generations of hypotheses, and check them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In effect AI will depend less on *believing* various statements generated in the outside world.&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is akin to looking for a single shape that will fit all different shaped slots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, what is ignored is that animals are just as capable of emotions and emotional states as we are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When looking on Youtube for insects fighting each other, or competing or courting, it should be clear that simple creatures experience them too!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I challenge people about emotions, I suggest to them to go to Corinthians 13 - which describes the attributes of love. If you consider all those attributes, one should notice that an actual &quot;feeling&quot; is not required for fulfilling any of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, the suggestion that a psychopath lacks emotions, and so he commits crimes or other pursuits outside of &quot;normal&quot; boundaries is far from true, especially when one considers the various records left to us from court cases and perhaps psychological evaluation - which show us that they do act out of &quot;strong&quot; emotions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be considered that a psychopath's behaviour is motivated out of negative emotions and emotional states with a distinct lack of or disregard of morality and a disregard of conscience. Psychopaths &quot;enjoy&quot; what they do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am strongly suggesting to all that we are blinded by our reasoning, and by the reasoning of others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though I do agree with the following quote mentioned before: -&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Dave H. wrote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    From a computational standpoint, emotions represent global state that influences a lot of other processing. Hormones etc. are basically just implementation. A sentient or sapient computer certainly could experience emotions, if it was structured in such a way as to have such global states affecting its thinking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, his reasoning below it (that quote) is also seriously flawed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emotions are both active and passive: They are triggered by thoughts and they trigger our thoughts; Emotions are a mental state and a behaviourial quality; Emotions react to stimuli or measure our responses to them; Emotions are independant regulators and moderators; Yet they provoke our focus and attention to specific criteria; and they help us when intuition and emotion agree or they hinder us when conscience or will clash.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A computer has the same potential as us to feel emotions, but the skill of implementing emotions is much more sophisticated than the one solution fits all answer people are seeking here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, if anyone argues that emotions are simply &quot;states&quot; where a response or responses can be designed around it, really does not understand the complexity of emotions; the &quot;freedom&quot; emotions and thoughts have independently of each other; or what constitutes true thought!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Programmers and scientists are notorious for &quot;simulating&quot; the real experiences of emotions or intelligence, without understanding the intimate complexities; Thinking that in finding the perfect simulation they have &quot;discovered&quot; the real experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Psi-theory seems to adequately give a proper understanding of the matter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi-theory&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I would say that the simulation of emotional states &quot;is&quot; equivalent to experiencing emotions, but those emotional states are far more complex than what most realise.&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is a far different dynamic set of circumstances than what has been touted above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if it was claimed by a woman that a man raped her - which was not reported to the police - it is not enough to compare one person's statements to another in order to determine truth. This is because collusion, influenced or coherced third parties, mistaken perceptions and false beliefs would give false positives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if an AI could establish from her statement that on the day she claimed to have been raped, that the alleged assailant was incapacitated while in her company, until she left his home, because the police report stated that she was upset with the assailant because he was asleep because of drugs during her whole stay. But, this police report comes from an independent source who states, Mr. &quot;x&quot; was asleep that day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Doing a strict textual check is not going to give the correct answers. analysing her friends and associattes chatter could also confirm a false report as being true.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, an AI has to have the ability to &quot;test&quot; written reports outside of the criteria of what was spoken.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is akin to looking for a single shape that will fit all different shaped slots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, what is ignored is that animals are just as capable of emotions and emotional states as we are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When looking on Youtube for insects fighting each other, or competing or courting, it should be clear that simple creatures experience them too!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I challenge people about emotions, I suggest to them to go to Corinthians 13 - which describes the attributes of love. If you consider all those attributes, one should notice that an actual &quot;feeling&quot; is not required for fulfilling any of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, the suggestion that a psychopath lacks emotions, and so he commits crimes or other pursuits outside of &quot;normal&quot; boundaries is far from true, especially when one considers the various records left to us from court cases and perhaps psychological evaluation - which show us that they do act out of &quot;strong&quot; emotions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be considered that a psychopath's behaviour is motivated out of negative emotions and emotional states with a distinct lack of or disregard of morality and a disregard of conscience. Psychopaths &quot;enjoy&quot; what they do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am strongly suggesting to all that we are blinded by our reasoning, and by the reasoning of others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though I do agree with the following quote mentioned before: -&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dave H. wrote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; From a computational standpoint, emotions represent global state that influences a lot of other processing. Hormones etc. are basically&#xD;&#xA;&gt; just implementation. A sentient or sapient computer certainly could&#xD;&#xA;&gt; experience emotions, if it was structured in such a way as to have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; such global states affecting its thinking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, his reasoning below it (that quote) is also seriously flawed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emotions are both active and passive: They are triggered by thoughts and they trigger our thoughts; Emotions are a mental state and a behaviourial quality; Emotions react to stimuli or measure our responses to them; Emotions are independant regulators and moderators; Yet they provoke our focus and attention to specific criteria; and they help us when intuition and emotion agree or they hinder us when conscience or will clash.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A computer has the same potential as us to feel emotions, but the skill of implementing emotions is much more sophisticated than the one solution fits all answer people are seeking here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, if anyone argues that emotions are simply &quot;states&quot; where a response or responses can be designed around it, really does not understand the complexity of emotions; the &quot;freedom&quot; emotions and thoughts have independently of each other; or what constitutes true thought!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Programmers and scientists are notorious for &quot;simulating&quot; the real experiences of emotions or intelligence, without understanding the intimate complexities; Thinking that in finding the perfect simulation they have &quot;discovered&quot; the real experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Psi-theory seems to adequately give a proper understanding of the matter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi-theory&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I would say that the simulation of emotional states &quot;is&quot; equivalent to experiencing emotions, but those emotional states are far more complex than what most realise.&#xD;&#xA;" />

However, what your definition of *plugged in* is unclear. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you mean literally, and *physically*, plugged in to the wall then **yes**, as [Aus points out](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401), because one can use a battery, or have a solar powered circuit, or petrol/diesel/steam/water/wind/hydrogen/etc. powered engine, running a generator/alternator which can eventually supply a voltage and current to power the circuitry. However, in these examples, you have merely moved the point of generation, from a remote power station to a locally generated source of electricity - so it is still, in effect, *plugged in* (but to a local source). So, in that sense, the answer is **no**. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you mean no external power source, ***what so ever***, then the answer is most certainly **no**, as, again as [Aus has already said](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401), there is no way for electrons to be pushed around the circuit, and therefore the circuit is dead&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you mean, as you said in your [comment](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#comment-2620) that the AI has created its own electrical power source - although as [Ankur says in their answer](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401), this implies that the AI has the ability for its I/O manipulate its environment&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - then as in the first paragraph, you have simply moved the point of the power source, so one can say that it is again now *plugged in*, again to a local energy source, and so yet again the answer is **no**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you are *not* referring to an electronic based computer, which is hosting the AI, but are, instead, referring to a *hypothetical biological* computer, then the answer is probably **yes** - in a sense. Although, that biological computer would still require energy input, as energy can't just be &quot;magicked&quot; out of thin air. It would need to be converted from one source into a from that the biological computer can use. That energy could come from a variety of sources, be it from sunlight, food,  heat (sunlight, deep sea vents, etc), so one could argue that it is still *plugged in* to an *energy source* and so yet again, the answer is **no**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be honest, in order to give an accurate, and sensible answer, you really need to reword your question, clarify what you mean and what your definitions of *plugged in* and *AI host* are.

Unless you're up for a real challenge this is probably what you should do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, it is _possible_ to build a single CNN that takes input of images as varying dimensions.  There are a number of ways you might try to do this, and I'm not aware of any published science analyzing these different choices.  The key is that the set of learned parameters needs to be shared between the different inputs sizes.  While convolutions can be applied at different images sizes, ultimately they always get converted to a single vector to make predictions with, and the size of that vector will depend on the geometries of the inputs, convolutions and pooling layers.  You'd probably want to dynamically change the pooling layers based on the input geometry and leave the convolutions the same, since the convolutional layers have parameters and pooling usually doesn't.  So on bigger images you pool more aggressively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Practically you'd want to group together similarly (identically) sized images together into minibatches for efficient processing.  This is common for LSTM type models.  This technique is commonly called &quot;bucketing&quot;.

At the end it should also display the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; best solution found.    &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You may use the following operators:  &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1.  Reproduction.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; You can use either one of the following reproduction&#xD;&#xA;&gt; types:  Proportional, Ranking, Tournament. They are described more in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; detail below:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2.  Crossing over.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In order to perform this operation the individuals must be grouped in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pairs (randomly), and  with certain probability pcross information&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from their chromosomes must be exchanged. There  are many flavors of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the crossing-over operator, but in our case (short, 16-bit&#xD;&#xA;&gt; chromosome),  simple, one-point crossover will be enough. It can be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; performed by selecting a random  number k from the range &lt;1;15&gt; and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cutting the chromosomes of both individuals on that  position. Each of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the individuals copies bits &lt;k;16&gt; belonging to the other to it’s own &#xD;&#xA;&gt; chromosome.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3.  Mutation  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This operator changes the value of each bit in the chromosome to the opposite one with a very  small probability pm&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (usually about 10-3).  If we denote chromosome as [b1, b2, ... , b16];&#xD;&#xA;&gt; then after the mutation each bit can be  described as:  Where k Î&#xD;&#xA;&gt; {1,2, ...,16}  flip(x) – result of a Bernoulli flip with a success &#xD;&#xA;&gt; probability x.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here I see that by Reproduction and Crossover he means different things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is the catch?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ccbso.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_operator#Operators&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/genetic-algorithms/crossover-mutation.php&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/genetic_algorithms/genetic_algorithms_fundamentals.htm" />

No. A broken machine can potentially be rebuilt and reactivated if it is broken. It never really died; it was destroyed.

So, here is your complex solution: start with the context, which is determined by the combination of words in sentence (combinatorics and search problem), from there determine your structure, or &quot;parse&quot; (at this step you can also filter out some insignificant words or at least assign lesser weights to them), go back to the context, back to parsing, and on until you arrive at the meaning.

Text="Firstly, an AGI could conceivably exhibit all of the observable properties of intelligence without being conscious. Although that may seem counter-intuitive, at present we have no physical theory that allows us to detect consciousness (philosophically speaking, a ['Zombie'][1] is indistinguishable from a non-Zombie - see the writing of [Daniel Dennett][2] and [David Chalmers][3] for more on this). Destroying a non-conscious entity has the same moral cost as destroying a chair.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, note that 'destroy' doesn't necessarily mean the same for entities with *persistent substrate*, i.e. their 'brain state' can be reversibly serialized to some other storage medium and/or multiple copies of them can co-exist. So if by 'destroy' we simply mean 'switch off', then an AGI might conceivably be reassured of a subsequent re-awakening. Douglas Hofstadter gives an interesting description of such an 'episodic consciousness' in [&quot;A Conversation with Einstein's Brain&quot;][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If by 'destroy', we mean 'irrevocably erase with no chance of re-awakening', then (unless we have a physical test which proves it is *not* conscious) destroying an entity with a seemingly human-level awareness is clearly morally tantamount to murder.

Take for example an artificial intelligence attempting to determine the meaning of a sarcastic sentence. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Naturally spoken, the sentence &quot;That's just what I needed today!&quot; can be the expression of very different feelings. In one instance, a happy individual finding an item that had been lost for some time could be excited or cheered up from the event, and exclaim that this moment of triumph was exactly what their day needed to continue to be happy. On the other hand, a disgruntled office employee having a rough day could accidentally worsen his situation by spilling hot coffee on himself, and sarcastically exclaim that this further annoyance was exactly what he needed today. This sentence should in this situation be interpreted as the man expressing that spilling coffee on himself made his bad day worse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is one small example explaining the reason linguistic analysis is difficult for artificial intelligence.

Ease of transport&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Self driving cars make transport easier and mean that drivers may be unnecessary in the future, resulting in a more pleasurable and easier drive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  In addition, this would make it easier for people with disabilities to travel as well as simplify the travel experience. Children could potentially be driven to school by a car without the supervision of a parent, for instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;5. Parking&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Self driving cars can be called to pick you up, meaning the need for parking in nearby locations and/or long walks to find your car may become a thing of the past as your car would drive up to you to pick you up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;6.

Note that I don't want to construct or generate new strings, the characters I extract must be part of the main text. Normally I would use a regex to extract this substring when the text and substring are relatively simple. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, from the text:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ... some text ...&#xD;&#xA;    Today, Fake Acme Corp. changed its name to Really Not Fake Acme Corp.&#xD;&#xA;    ... some more text ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would like to extract the names `Fake Acme Corp.` and `Really Not Fake Acme Corp.`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Points to keep in mind (aka why regex won't work):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The format of the sentence is not fixed, neither is its location in&#xD;&#xA;   the document. The 2 names could be in different sentences.&#xD;&#xA; - There is no guarantee that the new company name will be related to the old name.&#xD;&#xA; - There is no guarantee that only 2 company names will be mentioned in the document (so standard CRF approaches that detect the `ORG` class  viz. `CoreNLP`/`OpenNLP` won't be of much help).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**WHAT I'VE TRIED**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The training dataset is ~5000 labeled examples. This can be expanded if necessary. Using a character encoding format as per [this paper on character-level cnns][1] I constructed an LSTM network using [Keras][2] which took as input each character encoded in a one-hot format. The output was also a one-hot vector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eg: The input text is `1024` characters, encoded in a one-hot vector with an alphabet of `73` (see paper linked above for more on this). The output is a one-hot encoded vector that is the substring I want.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Input shape: `1024 x 73`, Output shape: `1024 x 73` (in the output only the characters that match the substring are one-hot, the rest of the rows are all `0`)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR**: Use LSTMs when regex will become too powerful/complicated/unable to work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626 &quot;this paper &amp;#40;Character-level CNNs&amp;#41;&quot;&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://keras.io/" />

Text="There is much discussion in philosophy about inner language and the ability to perceive pain (see [Pain in philosophy][1] article). Your question is in the area of philosophy and not science. If you define emotion as some state then you can construct simple automata with two states (emotion vs no-emotion). It can be a very complicated state with degrees of truth (percentage of emotion).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, to mimic human emotion you need to make a living human-like organism, and still with todays understanding and technology you will not be able to recognize emotion in it. The only thing you can do is trust when it says &quot;I'm sad&quot;.
