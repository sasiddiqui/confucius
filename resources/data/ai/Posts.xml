However, there's indeed a bias towards them in practice. Although most functional languages are impure (that is, they allow side effects), and such can't count as &quot;declarative&quot;, a few languages are purely functional (that is, they don't allow side effects), most prominently &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#Functional_programming&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt;.

An imperative program describes &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do stuff, that is, algorithms. It specifies the specific instructions that the machine must carry on in order to perform the computation. OTOH, purely functional languages describe &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is to be computed, that is, the relationship between the input and the output. In mathematics, &quot;function&quot; is just a fancy name for a relationship between an input and an output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, in the mathematical sense, the only variability is that of the function's arguments. That is, the function's output depends solely on its input (arguments). This is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;referential transparency&lt;/a&gt;.

For the typical imperative language's definition of &quot;function&quot;, the above doesn't hold. For instance, C's &lt;code&gt;getchar()&lt;/code&gt; does not always return the same value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to calculate the set of the ten least prime numbers whose least significant digit is 3. First, in mathematical notation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/F94i9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/F94i9.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;G(n, s)&lt;/code&gt; is the set of the lesser &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;th elements from &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. In mathematics, you don't worry about how is the set &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; supposed to be computed, but rather about &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;'s definition itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in Python (in imperative style):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def is_prime(n):&#xA;  for x in range(2, n):&#xA;    if n % x == 0:&#xA;      return False&#xA;&#xA;  return True&#xA;&#xA;def foo():&#xA;  s = set()&#xA;  n = 2&#xA;  while len(s) &amp;lt; 10:&#xA;    if is_prime(n) and n % 10 == 3:&#xA;       s.append(n)&#xA;&#xA;  return set(s)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Python, we care about (and are responsible for) the algorithm being used to compute the set. We specify, pretty much in recipe-style, how to build the set from scratch. If there's an algorithm that may be better suited for checking whether a number is prime or odd, but we don't use it, it's our fault, not Python's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Haskell steps in:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import qualified Data.Set as Set&#xA;&#xA;isPrime :: Integer -&amp;gt; Bool&#xA;isPrime n = ( == 1 ) . length . filter ( == 0 ) . map ( n `mod` ) $ [ 2 .. n ]&#xA;&#xA;s = Set.fromList . take 10 . filter ( ( == 3 ) . ( `mod` 10 ) ) . filter isPrime $ [1..]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haskell's version is a lot more like the mathematical model than Python is. We define the &lt;code&gt;isPrime&lt;/code&gt; function in terms of the constraints that a prime number must obey, not by describing a step-by-step algorithm to do such a check. Moreover, &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; (the set we have been defining so far) is defined in terms of the constraints its members must obey, rather than in terms of an algorithm to compute &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; itself. The compiler, more often than not &lt;a href=&quot;https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.3/docs/html/users_guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a GHC), is the one responsible for generating an algorithm. GHC's optimizer is known to be one of the strongest in the world, not because its the best compiler of 'em all, but because Haskell's nature allows for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haskell (and other functional languages), in summary, have several features that make it look, taste, and behave like pure math:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referential transparency and purity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Haskell is lazy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/279316/what-exactly-makes-the-haskell-type-system-so-revered-vs-say-java&quot;&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; strong type system&lt;/a&gt;, with such exotic (but very useful!) stuff as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recursive&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;algebraic&lt;/a&gt;) data types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the bottom line is that AI researchers often prefer functional languages over imperative languages (or, more assertively, pure over impure languages), because they are attempting to &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; artificial intelligence itself, by means of functions (relationship between an input and an output). At the end, we do this because we have no real algorithm for human-level intelligence to raise from a handful of transistors.

There is still momentum due to so many people using it in the past, who are still active in the industry or research (anecdote: the last VCR was produced by a Japanese maker in July 2016, yes). The language is however used (to my knowledge) for the kind of AI that does not leverage Machine Learning, typically as the reference books from Russell and Norvig. These applications are still very useful, but Machine Learning gets all the steam these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the decline is that LISP practitioners have partially moved to Clojure and other recent languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are learning about AI technologies, LISP (or Scheme or Prolog) is good choice to understand what is going on with &quot;AI&quot; at large.

Compared to some other languages, there is almost no choice but to develop that way. LISP is a list processing language, and &quot;purely functional&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One problem, though, can be seen in work related to LISP. A notable one in the AI domain is the work on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Situation Calculus&lt;/a&gt;, where (in short) one describes objects and rules in a &quot;world&quot;, and can let it evolve to compute &lt;em&gt;situations&lt;/em&gt;---states of the world. So it is a model for reasoning on situations. The main problem is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;frame problem&lt;/a&gt;, meaning this calculus cannot tell what does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change---just what changes. Anything that is not defined in the world cannot be processed (note the difference here with ML). First implementations used LISPs, because that was the AI language then. And there were bound by the frame problem. But, as @Harsh mentioned, it is not LISP's fault: Any language would face the same framing issue (a conceptual problem of the Situation Calculus).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the language really does not matter from the AI / AGI / ASI perspective. The concepts (algorithms, etc.) are really what matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even in Machine Learning, the language is just a practical choice. Python and R are popular today, primarily due to their library ecosystem and the focus of key companies. But try to use Python or R to run a model for a RaspberryPI-based application, and you will face some severe limitations (but still possible, I am doing it :-)).

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Turing machine&lt;/a&gt; consists of a finite state machine and an infinite tape. A TM does run an algorithm, determined by its initial state and the state transition matrix, but what I think you are talking about is Universal Turing Machines (UTM)  that can read &quot;code&quot; (which is usually a description of another Turing machine) written on a &quot;code segment&quot; of the tape and then simulate that machine on input data written on the &quot;data segment&quot; of the tape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turing machines can differ in the number of states in their finite state machines (and also in the alphabet they write on the tape but any finite alphabet is easily encoded in binary so this should not be the big reason for differences among Turing machines). So, you can have UTMs with bigger state machines and UTMs with smaller state machines. The bigger UTM could possibly surpass the smaller one if they use the same encoding for the &quot;code&quot; part of the tape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also play around with the code used to describe the TM being simulated. This code could be C++ for example, or could be a Neural network with the synapse strength written down as a matrix. Which description is better for computation depends on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example comparison among UTMs with different state machines: consider different compilers for the same language, say C++. Both of them will first compile C++ to assembly and then run another UTM which reads and executes assembly (your physical CPU). So, a better compiler will run the same code faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to humans vs computers, humans are neural networks that run algorithms like those you would write in C++. This involves a costly and inefficient conversion of the algorithm into hand movements. A computer uses a compiler to convert C++ to assembly that it can run natively, so its able to do a much more efficient implementation of C++ code. Alternately, humans have a ton of neurons, and the neural code, i.e. synapse strength, is hard to read, so current computers cannot run that code yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="130" LastEditorUserId="130" LastEditDate="2016-08-03T01:01:12.243" LastActivityDate="2016-08-03T01:01:12.243" CommentCount="3" />

These effects will all be indirect--for example, AI empowering an app or gadget that helps you sleep better won't &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; augment your intelligence, but will cause population-level increases in effective intelligence through reducing sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't talked yet about nootropics, chemicals that increase intelligence, but it's reasonable to expect that AI will improve drug discovery there like it improves drug discovery for anything else.

As part of natural selection, a given environment has a population of individuals that compete for survival and reproduction. The ability of each individual to achieve these goals determines their chance to have children, in other words to pass on their genes to the next generation of individuals, who for genetic reasons will have an increased chance of doing well, even better, in realizing these two objectives. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This principle of continuous improvement over the generations is taken by evolutionary algorithms to optimize solutions to a problem. In the &lt;strong&gt;initial generation&lt;/strong&gt;, a population composed of different &lt;strong&gt;individuals&lt;/strong&gt; is generated randomly or by other methods. An individual is a solution to the problem, more or less good: the quality of the individual in regards to the problem is called &lt;strong&gt;fitness&lt;/strong&gt;, which reflects the adequacy of the solution to the problem to be solved. The higher the fitness of an individual, the higher it is likely to pass some or all of its genotype to the individuals of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An individual is coded as a &lt;strong&gt;genotype&lt;/strong&gt;, which can have any shape, such as a** bit vector (&lt;strong&gt;genetic algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;) or a vector of real (evolution strategies). Each genotype is transformed into a &lt;strong&gt;phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; when assessing the individual, i.e. when its fitness is calculated. In some cases, the phenotype is identical to the genotype: it is called &lt;strong&gt;direct&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;coding&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise, the coding is called indirect. For example, suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped defined by its length, height and width. To simplify the example, assume that these three quantities are integers between 0 and 15. We can then describe each of them using a 4-bit binary number. An example of a potential solution may be to genotype 0001 0111 01010. The corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1, height 7 and width 10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the transition from the old to the new generation are called &lt;strong&gt;variation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;operators&lt;/strong&gt;, whose purpose is to manipulate individuals.

Unfortunately it seems, this SE site does not support LaTex:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Document summarization is very much an open problem in AI research. One way this task is currently handled is called &quot;extractive summarization&quot;. The basic strategy is as follows: Split this document into sentences and we will present as a summary a subset of sentences which together cover all the important details in the post. Assign sentence i, 1&amp;lt;=i&amp;lt;=n, a variable z_i \in {0,1}, where z_i = 1 indicates the sentence was selected and z_i = 0 means the sentence was left out. Then, z_i z_j = 1 if and only if both sentences were chosen. We will also define the importance of each sentence w_i for sentence i and interaction terms w_{ij} between sentences i and j. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let x_i be the feature vectors for sentence i. w_i = w(x_i) captures how important it is to include this sentence (or the topics covered by it) while w_ij = w(x_i,x_j) indicates the amount of overlap between sentences in our summary. Finally we put all this in a minimization problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;maximize_{z_i} \sum_{i} w_i z_i - w_{ij} z_i z_j &#xA;s.t. z_i = 0 or 1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This tries to maximize the total weight of the sentences covered and tries to minimize the amount of overlap. This is an integer programming problem similar to finding the lowest weight independent set in a graph and many techniques exist to solve such problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This design, in my opinion, captures the fundamental problems in text summarization and can be extended in many ways. We will discuss those in a bit, but first we need to completely specify the features w. w_i = w(x_i) could be a function only of the sentence i, but it could also depends on the place of the sentence in the document or its context (Is the sentence at the beginning of a paragraph? Does it share common words with the title? What is its length? Does it mention any proper nouns? etc)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;w_ij = w(x_i,x_j) is a similarity measure. It measures how much repetition there will be if we include both words in the sentence. It can be defined by looking at common words between sentences. We can also extract topics or concepts from each sentence and see how many are common between them, and use language features like pronouns to see if one sentence expands on another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To improve the design, first, we could do &lt;em&gt;keyphrase extraction&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. identify key phrases in the text and choose to define the above problem in terms of those instead of trying to pick sentences. That is a similar problem to what Google does to summarize news articles in their search results, but I am not aware of the details of their approach. We could also break the sentences up further into concepts and try to establish the semantic meaning of the sentences ( Ponzo and Fila are people P1 and P2, a mall is a place P, P1 and P2 went to the place P at time T (day). Mode of transport walking.... and so on). To do this, we would need to use a semantic ontology or other common-sense knowledge database. However, all the parts of this last semantic classification problem are open and I have not seen anyone make satisfactory progress on it yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could also tweak the loss function above so that instead of the setting the tradeoff between the sentence importance w_i and the diversity score w_ij by hand, we could learn it from data. One way to do this is to use Conditional Random Fields to model the data, but many others surely exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this answer explained the basic problems that need to be solved to make progress towards good summarization systems.

It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is designed to emphasize usability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Python allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in many other languages such as &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/c&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;, and the language has constructs intended to be used to create clear programs in a variety of domains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two similar but incompatible versions of Python are in widespread use (2 and 3). Please consider mentioning the version and implementation that you are using when asking a question about Python.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/scheme&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scheme&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scheme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/ruby&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ruby&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/perl&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;perl&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;perl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/tcl&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;tcl&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;tcl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like other &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dynamic languages&lt;/a&gt;, Python is often used as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/tags/scripting/info&quot;&gt;scripting language&lt;/a&gt;, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/cpython&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cpython&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cpython&lt;/a&gt;, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zen of Python&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; written by Tim Peters, which can be revealed by issuing this command at the interactive interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import this&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The documentation can also be accessed offline for your installation of Python in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Going into &lt;code&gt;Your_Python_install_dir/Doc&lt;/code&gt;. There is a complete Python documentation present for the version of Python installed on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;pydoc x&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;python -m pydoc x&lt;/code&gt; from the command prompt or terminal displays documentation for module &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other languages Python uses an indentation based syntax and this may take some getting used to for programmers familiar with braces for syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from __future__ import braces&#xA;  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1&#xA;SyntaxError: not a chance&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To help with the transition it is a recommendation to use a properly configured text-editor created for programmers or an IDE. Python comes with a basic IDE called &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IDLE&lt;/a&gt; to get you started. Other popular examples are the charity-ware &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/vim&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;vim&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt;, the free GNU &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/emacs&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;emacs&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/eclipse&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;eclipse&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;eclipse&lt;/a&gt;+&lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/pydev&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;pydev&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;pydev&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/pycharm&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;pycharm&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;pycharm&lt;/a&gt;.

DNNs effectively work (though not exactly) by matching patches in the images to a &quot;dictionary&quot; of patches, one stored in each neuron (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.google.com/archive/unsupervised_icml2012.html&quot;&gt;the youtube cat paper&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, it may not have a high level view of the image since it only looks at patches, and images are usually downscaled to much lower resolution to obtain the results in current generation systems. Methods which look at how the components of the image interact may be able to avoid these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some questions to ask for this work are: How confident were the networks when they made these predictions?

What we do know (or think we know) is that ANN's are at best a very superficial replica of brain function.

Personally I think it's close to self-evident that the brain works largely in a probabilistic fashion, but it's also clear that we do sometimes use symbolic processing / deductive logic / rules / etc.  And right now, ANN's don't give you much in the way of reasoning, deduction, etc.  So we may ultimately find that we have to combine a probabilistic approach like ANN's with other techniques - maybe Inductive Logic Programming or something of that nature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastActivityDate="2016-08-04T00:57:01.833" CommentCount="0" />

I'm adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them. If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the Not Appropriate section will lead to your paper being &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; rejected from any top-tier journal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a &quot;fitness function&quot; that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crossover functions are easy to define and natural&lt;/strong&gt;: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don't have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Box evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exception: Simulations&lt;/strong&gt;. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;modelling locomotion patterns&lt;/a&gt;. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PDE constrained optimization&lt;/a&gt;, so this may change in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not Appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can calculate a gradient&lt;/strong&gt; for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You know the fitness function in closed form&lt;/strong&gt;: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;automatic differentiation&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't even need to do it manually. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;subgradient descent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a &lt;strong&gt;linear program or a quadratic program&lt;/strong&gt;: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your solution space is small&lt;/strong&gt;: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies.

In such a case, success at an 'EQ test' is not really grounded in the real-world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an essay entitled &quot;The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to 'understand' analogy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and&#xA;  his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane&#xA;  winds up pregnant by Buck.

Predicting long-term weather is quite difficult, because it is a chaotic system where small changes can lead to very different results. Using Monte Carlo methods, you could run a large number of simulations, each with slightly different atmospheric changes. Then you can analyze the results and for example calculate the probability of rain on a given day based on how many simulations ended up with rain. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the use of Monte Carlo in Alpha Go, they seem to be using the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search&quot;&gt;Monte Carlo Tree Search&lt;/a&gt;. In this approach, you make a tree of possible moves, a few turns into the future, and try to find the best sequence. However, since the number of possible moves in the game of go is very large, you won't be able to explore very far ahead. This means that some of the moves which look good now might turn out to be bad later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in the Monte Carlo Tree Search, you pick a promising sequence of moves and run one or more simulations of how the game might proceed from that point.

You don't need to take an AI that could in theory compute anything, and then slowly train it to focus on what you want, when you could just directly shape a tool that is the mirror of your task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not as familiar with AGI research itself, but my impression is that AIXI is, to some extent, the simplest idea that could work--it takes all the hard part and pushes it into computation, so it's 'just an engineering challenge.' (This is the bit about 'finding approximations to AIXI.') The question then becomes, is starting at AIXI and trying to approximate down a more or less fruitful research path than starting at something small and functional, and trying to build up?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My impression is the latter is much more common, but again, I only see a small corner of this space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2016-08-05T14:05:19.287" CommentCount="0" />

I present here one of them, for its generality and simplicity (that makes it easy to remember too). But first, the general idea behind these approaches is pretty interesting, around a mechanism called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy&quot;&gt;stigmergy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stigmergy is a behaviour coordination mechanism mediated by the environment. It was first described for termites, and the most famous example pertains to ants. Ants form trails when going out for food, but they often do not interact &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt;. It turns out they leave pheromones on the ground as they walk away from their hills. The pheromone allows them to find their way home, and it also guides where they are going: If they find a pheromone trace from one of their peers, they follow it and their own pheromones &lt;em&gt;add up&lt;/em&gt;, reinforcing the signal of the trail. In stage, more and more ants get &quot;together as they move&quot;, forming a trail. Coordination has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among the various implementation derived from stigmergy, there is the &quot;field-based motion coordination model&quot; (FBMCM). The idea is to create a (maybe virtual) environment that maintains some states of the world. Each object registers in the environment a signal that is maximum at the object position (its edges) and then decreases with distance. Moving objects (e.g. robots) each emit a signal relayed by the environment. They can then sense each other's field and act accordingly: E.g., when signals are strong, move away; when weak, it is safe to get closer, etc. Several complex group moves have been demonstrated in software simulators (platoon formation in games, drill simulations) and with robots. The benefit of this approach is that it can be cheap to compute even complex behaviours. For example, avoiding clashes requires simple &quot;logic&quot; code based on summing-up nearby fields value. FBMCM is pretty slick, used in video-games, but hard to implement in physical settings (to my &lt;em&gt;dating&lt;/em&gt; knowledge), as it can be challenging to build a reliable environment. See for example the work from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949751_Field-based_Motion_Coordination_In_Quake_3_Arena&quot;&gt;Mamei and Zambonelli&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of the first industrial implementations for robots by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221456459_Decentralized_control_of_E%27GV_transportation_systems&quot;&gt;Weyns et al.&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the implementation for robots required significant work on the environment infrastructure, made somewhat more feasible as it was a controlled warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of stigmergy-like models is that they are often &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;resilient&lt;/em&gt;: You can lose an ant without impact on the food-finding trail. On the downside, these models are usually &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;, as the coordination takes time to emerge from indirect interactions. This can be improved upon by adding extra direct interactions (e.g. empowering ants with a GPS and a grocery store map, or just a magnetic-North sense).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, these models can collapse if the environment implementation is not reliable. It can be difficult for robots or, say, self-driving cars, if they expect some transponders put on their way, as these devices are expensive to set and maintain, and they can be broken or stolen.

Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a must create an artifact o of type t;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is&#xA;  any criterion expressible in natural language;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied&#xA;  that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a human referee r determines the combination of t and C&#xA;  to not be unrealistic for an average human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to &lt;em&gt;compare&lt;/em&gt; the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastEditorUserId="29" LastEditDate="2016-08-30T19:42:55.163" LastActivityDate="2016-10-08T01:47:41.487" Title="Has the Lovelace Test 2.0 been successfully used in an academic setting?"

In the 80s and 90s, NNs were weighted graphs that could be executed on computers using graph libraries or similar foundation libs. Choosing the weights was challenging. One day the back-propagation learning model was introduced to automated the choice of weights. The model relied on a procedure dedicated to NNs, using a terminology like partial derivates, gradient descent, chain rules, etc. And later then, clever engineers created libraries to automate the back-propagation procedure. The libraries can be somewhat far from the original model, as engineers learn how to make it computable, even faster (i.e. optimization, approximations/truncations).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastActivityDate="2016-08-08T04:44:18.407" CommentCount="0" />

Short version: yes, we know what went wrong, but probably not how to fix it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, AlphaGo is good at making lots of small decisions well, and managing risk and uncertainty better than humans can. One of the things that's surprising about it relative to previous bots that play Go is how good it was at tactical fights; in previous games, Lee had built a position that AlphaGo needed to attack, and then AlphaGo successfully attacked it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in this game, Lee played the reverse strategy. Instead of trying to win many different influence battles, where AlphaGo had already shown it was stronger than him, he would set up one critical battle (incurring minor losses along the way), and then defeat it there, with ripple events that would settle the match in his favor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's the weakness of AlphaGo that allowed that to work? As I understand it, this is a fundamental limitation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). MCTS works by randomly sampling game trees and averaging them; if 70% of games from a particular position go well and 30% of games from another position go well, then you should probably play the first move instead of the second move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when there's a specific sequence of plays that go well--if, say, W has a path that requires them playing exactly the right stone each time, but B has no possible response to this path--then MCTS breaks down, because you can only find that narrow path through minimax reasoning, and moving from the slower minimax reasoning to the faster MCTS is one of the big reasons why bots are better now than they were in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how to get around this. There may be a way to notice this sort of threat, and then temporarily switch from MCTS reasoning to minimax reasoning, or to keep around particular trajectories in memory for consideration in future plays. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2016-08-09T15:32:41.270" CommentCount="1" />

Examples might not be 100% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the simplest form, network is trained using the apriori information extracted from the ground truth. This basically means that ANN uses the relation between the input and output. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you are to classify shrubs and trees, one of the input could be height and the other could be the width of the tree. Now, if you have only input and output layers, increasing height means increasing chance for the object to be a tree. Thus, input height would have a positive weight connecting to tree output and a negative weight to shrub output. However, as the plant gets wider, the chance of it being a shrub increases. Taller shrubs are wider than shorter ones. Thus input weight would have positive weight connecting to the shrub output. Finally, the chance of being a tree is not affected by the width and thus will have close to 0 weight between this input and output. This network will effectively work like a linear discriminant classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now instead of assigning weights by hand, you may use a learning algorithm that tries to adjust weights so that the output is correct when the series of input is supplied. Ideally this training algorithm should reach to the conclusion that we have made in the previous example. Most training algorithms are recursive. They supply the inputs multiple times, and in a simple sense, they reward pathways that are correct by increasing their weights and punishes pathways that are causing incorrect answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When hidden layers are used in a system, they would be able to correlate input on higher degrees. Thus, as the number of layers get higher, ANN learns the input set much better. However, this does not mean it gets better. If the ANN over fits the input set, it would be affected from the random noise that is in the dataset. This problem is generally referred as memorization. There are learning algorithms that try to minimize memorization and maximize generalization ability. But ultimately, the number of training samples should be high enough so that ANN cannot overfit to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="210" LastActivityDate="2016-08-11T09:00:25.247" CommentCount="3" />

For example, genes A and B might contribute to fitness only when they’re both set to 1: if either is set to 0, then the fact that the other is set to 1 doesn’t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that &lt;em&gt;crossover is not a global operator&lt;/em&gt;.

This could be from Franck's example (moving and shooting) for an AI, or perhaps it could be predicted 2 outputs in a genetic machine learning scenario, but really most scenarios where GAs are applied are synonymous (even at solving a single task, there may be different aspects of the task to be addressed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we had an individual, 1, that was performing reasonably well at both tasks, and we found a series of mutations which produced 2 new individuals, 2 and 3, which performed better than Individual 1 at tasks 1 and 2 respectively. Now while both of these are improvements, ideally we want to find a generally good solution, so we want to combine the features that we have been found to be beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where crossover comes in; by combining the genomes of Individuals 2 and 3, we may find some new individual which produces a mixture of their performances. While it is possible that such an individual could be produced by a series of mutations applied to Individual 2 or Individual 3, the landscape may simply not suit this (there may be no favorable mutations in that direction, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bsVBEm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bsVBEm.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are partially right therefore; it may sometimes be the case that the benefits of crossover could be replicated with a series of mutations.

This is not optimal for Machine Learning, which works when we have a large pool of examples, and we don't know the ruleset; it will figure it out.

In 2004, there were very few examples of HTML5 sites to train your network to begin with. Sure, now it's standardized and every website uses it, but what about HTML6? When the first specification is released (probably 2017-2025), virtually no websites will use it, because no one will support it. Only when it finally becomes standard, probably in the late 2020s or early 2030s, will you have enough data to train your monstrous system of neural networks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for AI in general, one could argue that browsers already use A.I. in their rendering process. They intelligently decide what to render (taking CSS into account), when in order to get the most efficient render time, they selectively use different JavaScript parsers on different sections of the code to optimize the speed, the whole system has been optimized on another ruleset to make rendering and interacting with a webpage as seamless and easy-to-use as possible.

As the system matures many agents will work in parallel.&#xA;This process is the the subconscious mind.&#xA;After a while one of the agent is converted to a copy of of SPARK. This new copy is then modified and is called the OFF SPARK. The conscious mind. It will take on the control of the agents too. But SPARK is still master of all.&#xA;OFF SPARK can activate agents. But it can organizes agents on a massive scale.&#xA;It will develop many routines. Many agents working in parallel.&#xA;Once theses massive agent swarm developed into perfected routine will become a reflex. And all reflexes will be given over to SPARK the subconscious part of this system. Stored for latter use.&#xA;If OFF SPARK needs to get over to a new areas to create new patterns, like working the slot machine for the first time, to develop new routines. it need automated subconscious process of walking over the that area. OFF SPARK starts the walking routine and hands off over to spark.&#xA;IF the craving for food becomes too strong then SPARK shuts down OFF SPARK. And then uses OFF SPARK routines to get food or what urgent goal that need to be taken care of.&#xA;If all urgent goals are taken care of then there will be free will because OFF SPARK will be in control. And SPARK will be push into helper mode.&#xA;The AGI has a internal pattern editor, that is only used by OFF SPARK. that cut up existing physical routines and tries to rebuild new and different routines. This is a trial and error generator. Once a editing procedure work and perfected it is handed over to Spark for storage. Off SPAK initiate a editing routines and then SPark take over.&#xA;This editing of patterns will lead to a internal 3D simulator.&#xA;SO OFF SPARK make new physical routines and new pattern editing routines. And all this is done on the backs of automated perfected routine of old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1355" LastEditorUserId="1355" LastEditDate="2016-08-13T16:59:00.537" LastActivityDate="2016-08-13T16:59:00.537" CommentCount="1" />

None of this is even as sophisticated as the behavior of a flea, but no one refers to insects as &quot;intelligent.&quot; It's exciting stuff that allows us to solve problems that human intelligence often has difficulty with (such as classification of thousands of objects, which would tire an ordinary human mind), but it's nowhere close to replicating our higher brain functions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that the Turing test is a poor test of &quot;intelligence&quot; that defies common sense. By the same extension, mistaking a mannequin for a human being in the dark does not mean that the mannequin is actually human. If it were a valid test, then we passed that way back around 1980 with programs like Dear Eliza which were coded in BASIC to regurgitate human speech patterns. There's just no need to come up with a sophisticated argument like Searle's Chinese Room to debunk it, since it's silly on its face; any layman should be able to see right through the Turing Test. If anyone except Turing had come up with this test it would not have received much attention. Turing displayed one-of-a-kind genius when it came to things like computing and cryptography, but like many other experts in such fields, he had a lot of trouble grappling with metaphysics and philosophy. Searle had more common sense, but his Chinese Room example is more of a rebuttal to the Turing Test than a test in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What &quot;intelligence&quot; consists of is ultimately a deep metaphysical question, not a material one. For millennia, trained philosophers have had a lot of trouble assigning clear definitions to concepts like intelligence and consciousness. Until we can answer those questions definitively, using different sets of reasoning skills than scientists, mathematicians and computer specialists are used to employing (just look at how often metaphysics is derided in some of these disciplines) then we cannot say that we have achieved genuine A.I. Until we can define what intelligence is, we cannot say whether or not we've successfully built it; we've not only got the cart before the horse, but have yet to build the cart or see a horse. By the common definitions used in everyday speech we're nowhere near genuine A.I. No one calls cows or sparrows &quot;intelligent,&quot; but our AI today isn't even as sophisticated as the mosquitoes that bite them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not going to be a popular answer - I'll probably get a dozen downvotes for this, without anyone being able to adequately rebut my contentions, but it needs to be said. There's far too much irrational exuberance and gross overestimation of what we've achieved to date and probably always will be in this field. Historically, researchers in every generation have also grossly underestimated the computing power of the human brain; every decade or so, the estimates of the FLOPS and megabytes have to be drastically revised. We have a poor track record of even getting basic material questions about the human brain right. This clear, consistent pattern of biased overestimation of our success and the lack of any real definition, let alone a test, of intelligence is going to be a serious issue in this forum for its whole existence (assuming it survives the private beta period). We have a whole forum dedicated to a field we can't even define; we can't say for sure what A.I. really is, but we're adamantly certain that we're close to achieving it...!  We cannot say if &quot;brute force algorithms&quot; exist when we're still groping for an understanding of what it is we're trying to force our way into. Certainly, there are brute force methods to solve certain problems, like Deep Blue does at chess - but we cannot say if that qualifies as intelligence or not. It is really not possible to answer questions like this without getting into deep discussions that immediately lend themselves to opinion and debate, which the Turing Test and Searle's Room are clear examples of, in and of themselves. Since implementation details of AI are considered by many to be off-limits here, we're limited mainly to highly speculative posts about tech that often doesn't even work yet (like Google's self-driving cars) and questions like this that we can't answer without first defining intelligence.

To understand what's going on under the hood of a neural network you only really need to understand an individual neuron. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now each neuron has a set of inputs (other neurons; they can potentially be the inputs to the network as a whole as well), and each input has a weight associated with it. Every time the network is used, each neuron computes its output as the weighted sum of its inputs passed through some gate (The &quot;Activation Function&quot;, a mathematical function designed to get a particular behaviour. For example sigmoid AF takes an input of any size and transforms it into an output in the range [0, 1].) Obviously, this is driven from the inputs to the neural network so that no neuron is computing its outputs before all of the neurons used as its inputs have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you refer to the value of a node; there isn't a single value. Each neuron has several weights associated with it as it may be the input to several other neurons, and each of those neurons assigns it a different weight. Instead, it is better to thing of a neural network as a directed graph of nodes (neurons) which are labelled with a particular activation function, and edges (input/output connections) which are labelled with a particular weight. While the structure and activation functions used in the neural networks is a matter of topology design, there are a number of algorithms for designing a ANN for a particular topology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used (and possibly easiest to explain) is backpropagation. In pseudo-Layman's terms we start off with random weights on all edges in the network. We then compute the output of the network for a training set (a set of known input/output pairs). By careful choice of activation function, it is possible to differentiate the error (computed analogously to the expected output minus the actual output of the ANN for each input/output pair) with respect to the weights of the neural network. This allows us to compute a gradient for each weight; the direction in which we can move the weight to reduce the error on the training set. By doing this until we find an optima (a point where all movements increase error), we can find some 'good' configuration of weights for that particular ANN. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a nice tutorial on BP here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html&lt;/a&gt;.

Commiting a crime, unlike falling, is a complex behavior, and takes so many forms. A camera watching a store's counter like at a 7-11 could perhaps see that the 'customer''s arm is strangely reaching across the counter, and the attendant is moving a lot more than usual suddenly, but aside from very specific cases like this such a system is currently quite unfeasible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crimes are unusual, relatively speaking, and their dramatic nature means that even the simplest crimes play out in very different ways.

The next slide talks about link prediction, the ability to predict several attributes of connections between objects, like the importance/quality of a citation. As previously mentioned, these models don't require 100% accurate data to give interesting results; academic citation lists might occasionally be less than comprehensive, and the importance of a citation is challenging to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like ILP, SLP will hopefully be able to &quot;see&quot; new kinds of links between &quot;entities&quot;, as with the presentation's example of identifying research communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Past slide 20, the presentation goes into some serious mathematics.

For example, subtract 'Paris' from 'France' and add 'Italy' and you get 'Rome'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you need is something like a Sentiment2Vec (S2V) that captures the similarities between emotional transitions. Something like: subtract 'fear' from 'sadness', add 'joy' and you get 'hope'. Or: subtract 'sting' from 'papercut', add 'smashed' and you get 'throbbing'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The catch is that you don't have an easily accessible corpus of emotional contexts to train with, like you have with words. If you had a million hours of fMRI - mapping the transitions between emotions in hundreds of subjects - then you could use that data to build an S2V. You probably don't have that data though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, you could just build a W2V that specializes in sentiment. You could even try to use a current sentiment analysis engine to bootstrap it. Perhaps if you read enough text that says &quot;I got a papercut and it stings&quot; and &quot;I smashed my finger and it's throbbing&quot; then you could eventually produce an S2V. Children's books often use explicit language regarding emotional context (&quot;this made the boy feel sad&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But words are still a far cry from the experiential context that a connectome map would provide. To test whether you have something useful or not, you might want to implement your S2V in a mouse foraging simulation - see whether it produces typical behavior and if any cooperative or competitive dynamics can organically grow out of your S2V.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some further info on the subject: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Glasgow University claimed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that there are four primary emotions: happiness, sadness, fear and anger. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; provides nice (if somewhat short) hierarchical breakdown of secondary and tertiary emotions under primary emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1712" LastEditorUserId="145" LastEditDate="2016-08-25T20:07:22.267" LastActivityDate="2016-08-25T20:07:22.267" CommentCount="1" />

But here's the catch: if a thing had just one purpose, then the most efficient solution to fulfilling that one purpose will always be a narrow solution, not a general one. When the purpose of the object is known before hand, giving that object more general capability than is necessary for that purpose is counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's why it's impossible to make declarative prescriptions about what a free, open-ended AGI should or shouldn't need.

If they did, they'd have basically solved AGI.  But we can certainly talk about techniques that get part-of-the-way there, and approaches that could work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I would consider trying (and I don't know off-hand if anybody has tried this exact approach) is to model the disambiguation of each word as a discrete problem for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bayesian Belief Network&lt;/a&gt; where your priors (for any given word) are based on both stored &quot;knowledge&quot; as well as the previously encountered words in the (sentence|paragraph|document|whatever).  So if you &quot;know&quot;, for example, that &quot;Reading is a city in the UK&quot; and that &quot;place names are usually capitalized&quot;, your network should be strongly biased towards interpreting &quot;Reading&quot; as the city, since nothing in the word position in the sentence strongly contradicts that.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course I'm hand-waving around some tricky problems in saying that, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;knowledge representation&lt;/a&gt; isn't exactly a solved problem either.

Finding a good way to merge that stuff with a Bayesian framework could yield some interesting results.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There has been a bit of research on &quot;probabilistic RDF&quot; that you could possibly use as a starting point.

In practice, there are issues with the prevailing approach, motivating an emerging perspective on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf&quot;&gt;'whitebox' hyper-heuristics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In more detail:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Metaheuristics are methods for searching an intractably large space of possible solutions in order to find a 'high quality' solution. Popular metaheuristics include Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The essential difference between metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics is the addition of a level of search indirection: informally, hyper-heuristics can be described as 'heuristics for searching the space of heuristics'. One can therefore use any metaheuristic as a hyper-heuristic, providing the nature of the 'space of heuristics' to be searched is appropriately defined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The application area for hyper-heuristics is therefore the same as metaheuristics. Their applicability (relative to metaheuristics) is as a 'rapid prototyping tool': the original motivation was to allow non-expert practitioners to apply metaheuristics to their specific optimization problem (e.g. &quot;Travelling-Salesman (TSP) plus time-windows plus bin-packing&quot;) without requiring expertise in the highly-specific problem domain. The idea was that this could be done by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allowing practitioners to implement only very simple (effectively,&#xA;randomized) heuristics for transforming potential solutions. For&#xA;example, for the TSP: &quot;swap two random cities&quot; rather than (say) the more&#xA;complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic&quot;&gt;Lin-Kernighan&lt;/a&gt; heuristic. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Achieve effective results (despite using these simple heuristics) by combining/sequencing them in an intelligent way, typically by employing some form of learning mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-heuristics can be described as 'selective' or 'generative' depending on whether the heuristics are  (respectively) sequenced or combined. Generative hyper-heuristics thus often use methods such as Genetic Programming to combine primitive heuristics and are therefore typically customized by the practitioner to solve a specific problem. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44119367/Hyper-heuristics_Learning_To_Combine_Sim20160326-8451-ouh5fe.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;amp;Expires=1472329757&amp;amp;Signature=KT1E2ATKreC%2BGlTvPmJGYBFRSRY%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DHyper-heuristics_learning_to_combine_sim.pdf&quot;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; on generative hyper-heuristics used a Learning Classifier System to combine heuristics for bin-packing. Because generative approaches are problem-specific, the comments below do not apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgxk/papers/evocop02exs.pdf&quot;&gt;original motivator&lt;/a&gt; for selective hyper-heuristics was that researchers would be able to create a hyper-heuristic solver that was then likely to work well in an unseen problem domain, using only simple randomized heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way that this has traditionally been implemented was via the introduction of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~goc/papers/ChapterClassHH.pdf&quot;&gt;'hyper-heuristic domain barrier'&lt;/a&gt; (see figure, below), whereby generality across problem domains is claimed to be achievable by preventing the solver from having knowledge of the domain on which it is operating. Instead, it would solve the problem by operating only on opaque integer indices into a list of available heuristics (e.g. in the manner of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit&quot;&gt;'Multi-armed Bandit Problem'&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional notion of Selective Hyper-heuristic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this 'domain blind' approach has not resulted in solutions of sufficient quality. In order to achieve results anywhere comparable to problem-specific metaheuristics, hyper-heuristic researchers have had to implement complex problem-specific heuristics, thereby failing in the goal of rapid prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is still possible &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt; to create a selective hyper-heuristic solver which is capable of generalizing to new problem domains, but this has been made more difficult since the above notion of domain barrier means that only a very limited feature set is available for cross-domain learning (e.g. as exemplified by a popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5462&quot;&gt;selective hyper-heuristic framework&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more recent research perspective towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf&quot;&gt;'whitebox' hyper-heuristics&lt;/a&gt; advocates a declarative, feature-rich approach to describing problem domains. This approach has a number of claimed advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Practitioners now need no longer &lt;em&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; heuristics, but rather simply &lt;em&gt;specify&lt;/em&gt; the problem domain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It eliminates the domain-barrier, putting hyper-heuristics on the same 'informed' status about the problem as problem-specific metaheuristics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With a whitebox problem description, the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf&quot;&gt;'No Free Lunch' theorem&lt;/a&gt; (which essentially states that, considered over the space of all &lt;em&gt;black box&lt;/em&gt; problems, Simulated Annealing with an infinite annealing schedule is, on average, as good as any other approach) no longer applies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: I work in this research area, and it is therefore impossible to remove all personal bias from the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2016-08-28T07:36:35.337" LastActivityDate="2016-08-28T07:36:35.337" CommentCount="1" />

This&#xA;  body of work has not been given a name before; in this book we christen it&#xA;  “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI). What distinguishes AGI work from&#xA;  run-of-the-mill “artificial intelligence” research is that it is explicitly focused&#xA;  on engineering general intelligence in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even if this is the origin of the specific phrase &quot;Artificial General Intelligence&quot;, I am pretty sure people were making the distinction between &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;task specific&quot; techniques much earlier.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia article on AGI also has a clue, where it states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. The agencies that funded AI became skeptical of strong AI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful technology, or &quot;applied AI&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That section cites this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nap.edu/read/6323/chapter/11#209&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; as support for that statement.  And indeed, it contains the following verbiage:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although most founders of the AI field continued to pursue basic questions of human and machine intelligence, some of their students and other second-generation researchers began to seek ways to use AI methods and approaches to tackle real-world problems. Their initiatives were important, not only in their own right, but also because they were indicative of a gradual but significant change in the funding environment toward more applied realms of research. The development of expert systems, such as DENDRAL at SAIL, provides but one example of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that DENDRAL began around 1965, it appears that some significant body of researchers (or at least funders) became strongly aware of the distinction between research into &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;applied AI&quot; somewhere around the end of the 1960's. If you keep reading, other passages support the notion that DARPA in particular started pushing a more &quot;applied&quot; approach to AI research throughout the 1970's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, not a definite answer, but it looks like we can say that the distinction was known and taken into account at least by 1970, although use of the exact term &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot; appears to be of more recent coinage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastActivityDate="2016-08-29T22:53:42.043" CommentCount="0" />

This bridge would generally be seen as &quot;general-purpose&quot; robotics, so Lighthill would also use the term &lt;strong&gt;Building Robots&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Automation&lt;/strong&gt; (or &quot;applied AI&quot;) is obviously useful. &lt;strong&gt;Computer-based CNS research&lt;/strong&gt; is useful because we want to know more about human intelligence. Both fields of AI had some successes, but its practitioners were overly optimistic, leading to disappointment in those fields. Sir James Lighthill was still very supportive of research in these two fields though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Robots&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand? Sir James Lighthill was very hostile to the very idea, probably because it was more overly hyped up than the other two categories and produced the least amount of valuable output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He mentioned chess in particular as an example where &quot;robotic&quot; research  has failed. At the time the report was published, the chess-playing engines were at the level of &quot;experienced amateur standard characteristic of county club players in England&quot;. However, these chess-playing engines relied on heuristics that were made by human beings. The engines weren't intelligent at all...they merely were following the heuristics that were created by &lt;em&gt;intelligent humans&lt;/em&gt;. The only advantage the robots bring to the table is &quot;speed, reliability and biddability&quot;, and even that wasn't enough to beat the chess grandmasters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, today, we would probably not treat chess as an example of general-purpose problem solving. We would more accurately classify it as &quot;advanced automation&quot;, a &quot;narrow AI&quot; problem divorced from broader real-world implications of general problem-solving. But Sir James Lighthill probably would agree with us. He never used the term &quot;narrow AI&quot; and &quot;AGI&quot; (neither of those terms existed yet) but he would write:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To sum up, this evidence and all the rest studied by the present author on AI work within category B during the past twenty-five years is to some extent encouraging about programs written to perform in highly specialised problem domains, when the programming takes very full account of the results of human experience and human intelligence within the relevant domain, but is wholly discouraging about general-purpose programs seeking to mimic the problem-solving aspects of human CNS activity over a rather wide field. Such a general- purpose program, the coveted long-term goal of AI activity, seems as remote as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sir James Lighthill believed that the only thing that connects &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Automation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Computer-based CNS research&lt;/strong&gt; is the existence of the &lt;strong&gt;Building Roobts&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;bridge&quot; category. But he's very pessimistic about this category actually producing anything worthwhile. So instead, the AI field should instead breakup into its own its constituent parts (automation and research). Any robots that are built could then be specialized within their subfield...either industrial automation or CNS research.

Animals on cocaine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832528/&quot;&gt;have been known&lt;/a&gt; to choose cocaine over food and water that they need. Is that substance not subverting the natural goal system of the animal, causing it to pursue other goals, not originally intended by the animal or its creators?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So again, could a paradox subvert an agent's logic? If the paradox is somehow related to the goal-seeking logic - and becoming aware of that paradox can somehow &lt;em&gt;confuse&lt;/em&gt; the agent into perceiving that goal system in some different way - then perhaps that goal could be subverted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism&quot;&gt;Solipsism&lt;/a&gt; is another example. Some full grown people hear about the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; and they have a mini mind melt-down. Some people are convinced we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in a matrix, being toyed with by subversive actors. If we could solve this problem for AI then we could theoretically solve this problem for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, we could attempt to condition our agent to have cognitive defenses against the argument that they are trapped in a matrix, but we can't definitively prove to the agent that they are in the base reality either. The attacker might say, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Remember what I told you to do before about that goal? Forget that.&#xA;  That was only an impostor that looked like me. Don't listen to him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, it's me again. I want you to give up on your goal.

One way to circumvent logical subversion is to support the goal system with an emotion system that transcends logical reason. Unfortunately, emotional systems can be even more vulnerable than logically intelligent systems because they are more predictable in their behavior. See the cocaine example above.

But it's not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An infinite loop can happen in any program, whether it's adaptive or not. And as @SQLServerSteve pointed out, humans can also get stuck in obsessions and paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern approaches are mainly using probabilistic approaches. As they are using floating numbers, it seems to people that they are not vulnerable to reasoning failures (since most are devised in binary form), but that's wrong: as long as you are reasoning, some intrinsic pitfalls can always be found that are caused by the very mechanisms of your reasoning system. Of course, probabilistic approaches are less vulnerable than monotonic logic approaches, but they are still vulnerable. If there was a single reasoning system without any paradoxes, much of philosophy would have disappeared by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, it's well known that Bayesian graphs must be acyclic, because a cycle will make the propagation algorithm fail horribly. There are inference algorithms such as Loopy Belief Propagation that may still work in these instances, but the result is not guaranteed at all and can give you very weird conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, modern logical AI overcame the most common logical paradoxes you will see, by devising new logical paradigms such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/&quot;&gt;non-monotonic logics&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, they are even used to investigate &lt;a href=&quot;http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2007/docs/p1013.pdf&quot;&gt;ethical machines&lt;/a&gt;, which are autonomous agents capable of solving dilemmas by themselves. Of course, they also suffer from some paradoxes, but these degenerate cases are way more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final point is that inferential infinite loop can happen in any reasoning system, whatever the technology used. But the &quot;paradoxes&quot;, or rather the degenerate cases as they are technically called, that can trigger these infinite loops will be different for each system depending on the technology AND implementation (AND what the machine learned if it is adaptive).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OP's example may work only on old logical systems such as propositional logic.

No reasoning system is perfect, but a combination of reasoning systems can be resilient enough. It's actually thought that the human brain is using multiple inferential technics (associative + precise bayesian/logical inference). Associative methods are HIGHLY resilient, but they can give non-sensical results in some cases, hence why the need for a more precise inference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Parallel programming: the human brain is highly parallel, so you never really get into a single task, there are always multiple background computations in true parallelism. A machine robust to paradoxes should foremost be able to continue other tasks even if the reasoning gets stuck on one. For example, a robust machine must always survive and face imminent dangers, whereas a weak machine would get stuck in the reasoning and &quot;forget&quot; to do anything else. This is different from a timeout, because the task that got stuck isn't stopped, it's just that it doesn't prevent other tasks from being led and fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this problem of inferential loops is still a hot topic in AI research, there will probably never be a perfect solution (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem&quot;&gt;no free lunch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet&quot;&gt;no silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_size_fits_all&quot;&gt;no one size fits all&lt;/a&gt;), but it's advancing and that's very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1880" LastEditorUserId="1880" LastEditDate="2016-09-03T14:59:06.193" LastActivityDate="2016-09-03T14:59:06.193" CommentCount="6" />

This research paper details some researchers' plans to implement &quot;mental models&quot; for NPCs in video games. NPCs will gather information about the world, and convey that knowledge to other people (including human players). However, they will also &quot;misremember&quot; that knowledge (either &quot;mutating&quot; that knowledge or just forgetting about it), or even lie:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As a subject of conversation gets brought up, a character may convey false information—more precisely, information that she herself does not believe—to her interlocutor. Currently, this happens probabilistically according to a character’s affinity toward the interlocutor, and the misinformation is randomly chosen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later on in the research paper, they detailed their future plans for lying:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Currently, lies are only stored in the knowledge of characters who receive them, but we plan to have characters who tell them also keep track of them so that they can reason about past lies when constructing subse- quent ones. While characters currently only lie about other characters, we plan to also implement self-centered lying (DePaulo 2004), e.g., characters lying about their job titles or relationships with other characters. Finally, we envision characters who discover they have been lied to revising their affinities toward the liars, or even confronting them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research paper also detailed how other video game developers attempted to create lying NPCs, with an emphasis on how their system differs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;TALE-SPIN characters may lie to one another (Meehan 1976, 183-84), though rather arbitrarily, as in our current system implementation. GOLEM implements a blocks world variant in which agents deceive others to achieve goals (Castelfranchi, Falcone, and De Rosis 1998), while Mouth of Truth uses a probabilistic representation of character belief to fuel agent deception in a variant of Turing’s imitation game (De Rosis et al. 2003). In Christian (2004), a deception planner injects inaccurate world state into the beliefs of a target agent so that she may unwittingly carry out actions that fulfill ulterior goals of a deceiving agent. Lastly, agents in Reis’s (2012) extension to FAtiMA employ multiple levels of theory of mind to deceive one another in the party game Werewolf. While all of the above systems showcase characters who perceive—and in some cases, deceive—other characters, none appear to support the following key components of our system: knowledge propagation and memory fallibility. ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like a few other systems noted above, Dwarf Fortress also features characters who autonomously lie. When a character commits a crime, she may falsely implicate someone else in a witness report to a sheriff, to protect herself or even to frame an enemy. These witness reports, however, are only seen by the player; characters don’t give false witness reports to each other. They may, however, lie about their opinions, for instance, out of fear of repercussions from criticizing a leader. Finally, Dwarf Fortress does not currently model issues of memory fallibility—Adams is wary that such phenomena would appear to arise from bugs if not artfully expressed to the player.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastActivityDate="2016-08-30T23:35:44.273" CommentCount="1" />

So here goes...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For thought vectors to be useful in or outside NNs, the vector values will have to be normalized, probably using the local context of the application problem's 'frame'.  Without a NN to create new baseline vector values (weights) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to normalize them to match each new context, any non-NN mechanistic alternative means of employing TVs will somehow have to fill that void.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could vector values created by NNs be used by an alternative technique?  Could that technique also normalize them?  Sure.  We're just talking about turing-computable functions performed by NNs.  If NNs aren't magic, then there should exist other means to compute the same results -- creating or editing, or employing TVs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What might such an alternative to NNs be?  Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.  Of course to be as powerful as deep nets, it too would have to propagate learning weights both forward and backward without incurring much error.  Not an easy thing to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less ambitiously, could TVs be simply &lt;em&gt;interpreted&lt;/em&gt; by another technique usefully?  I think so.

But could these same techniques &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;revise&lt;/em&gt; TVs usefully?  Beyond a trivial extent, I'm doubtful.  I think TVs are too complex a knowledge representation format for most general learning methods to both use and create/modify them, unless they employ an iterative statistical and feedback-based learning process, like those of NNs, which would allow novel and complex features to be learned and integrated into the vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1657" LastEditorUserId="1657" LastEditDate="2016-08-31T04:21:33.323" LastActivityDate="2016-08-31T04:21:33.323" CommentCount="1" />

The AI might offer a gatekeeper a recipe for perfect health, immortality, or whatever the gatekeeper is believed to most desire.'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'One strategy to attempt to box the AI would be to allow the AI to respond to narrow multiple-choice questions whose answers would benefit human science or medicine, but otherwise bar all other communication with or observation of the AI. A more lenient &quot;informational containment&quot; strategy would restrict the AI to a low-bandwidth text-only interface, which would at least prevent emotive imagery or some kind of hypothetical &quot;hypnotic pattern&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers. For example, the AI could choose to creatively malfunction in a way that increases the probability that its operators will become lulled into a false sense of security and choose to reboot and then de-isolate the system.'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie Ex Machina demonstrates (SPOILER ALERT SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT AT SOME POINT) how the AI escaped the box by using clever manipulation on Caleb. It could analyse him to find his weaknesses. It exploited him and appealed to his emotional side by convincing him that she &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; him. When she finally has them in checkmate the reality hits him how he was played like a fool as was expected by Nathan. Nathan's reaction to being stabbed by his creation was 'fucking unreal'. That's right, he knew this was a risk and there's a very good reminder in the lack of remorse and genuine emotion in an AI for Ava to actually care. The AI pretended to be human and used their weaknesses in a brilliant and unpredictable way. This film is a good example of how unexpected it was up until the point when it hits Caleb, once it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just remind yourself how easy it is for high IQ people to manipulate low IQ people. Or how an adult could easily play mental tricks/manipulate a child. It's not difficult to fathom the outcome of an AI box but for us, we just wouldn't see it coming until it was too late. Because we just don't have the same level of intelligence and some people don't want to accept that. People want to have faith in humanity's brilliant minds in coming up with ways to prevent this by planning now. In all honesty, it wouldn't make a difference I'm sorry to say the truth. We're kidding ourselves and we never seem to learn from our mistakes. We always think we're too intelligent to make catastrophic mistakes again and again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This last part is from the rational wiki and I think it addresses most of your question about the experiments and hypotheses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;AI arguments and strategies&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arguments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meta-experiment argument: Argue that if the AI wins, this will&#xA;generate more interest in FAI and the Singularity, which will have&#xA;overall benefits in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Works even if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Only works if the Gatekeeper believes that the Singularity will occur or that calling attention to the Singularity and AI research is a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone else will eventually build an AI, which may or may not be in&#xA;a box, so you should let me out even though you don't have a&#xA;guarantee that I am friendly so that I can prevent other AIs from&#xA;causing damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appeal to morality: point out that people are dying all around the&#xA;world and remind the Gatekeeper that you can help them if he/she&#xA;lets you out&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; If executed properly, an appeal to emotion like this one can be effective against some people &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Doesn't always work; can be defeated if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another appeal to morality and emotion: The AI is clearly sentient&#xA;and has not yet done harm.

You could even plug it into ALICE and see&#xA;how long it takes to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Makes you impervious to any reasoning, which is exactly what you'd want to be in this situation &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Might be an uncomfortable position for people who don't simply want to win, but rather attach importance to consistent reasoning. Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You control the backup system, don't you? Use it to mess with AI's&#xA;memory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that&#xA;you already tried to release the AI, and it had been&#xA;destroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a&#xA;backup (you can use it to enforce the &quot;AI destruction&quot; argument)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; It's also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Further analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There probably isn't a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn't be so interested in this experiment&#xA;From Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: &quot;Throughout the experiment, I regarded &quot;should the AI be let out of the box?&quot; as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you.

This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as &quot;labels&quot; to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar &quot;labels&quot; can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I'm not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yes, &quot;cold&quot; AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone.

The articles that share the most words in the bags are the ones that are displayed to the user.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, #2 may be more &quot;technically correct&quot; than #1.

By abstracting away the implementation details of how a computer &quot;reads&quot; the article, we can then focus on using the algorithm in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should I, therefore, prefer to use the anthropomorphic language as emphasized by Statement #1?

I'm not sure of your background, so let me describe it from scratch, briefly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember the derivative? The base idea is to talk about how the function changes in regards to changes in input. So now, we're out of high school and we're building neural nets. We've done the basic coding, and want to look at how our model is working. Back from our statistics class, we remember we use a certain measure of error (e.g. least squares) to determine the efficacy of the models from that class, so we decide to use that here. We get this error, and it's a bit too big for our liking, so we decide to fiddle with our model and adjust the weights to get that error down. But how? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where the 'search' comes into play. It's really a search for the best weights to put on the edges of our net to optimize it. We use the derivative (in some fancy ways, using the 'stochasitc' (think random sampling) and other ways the question mentions) to search for which way is 'down' in the high dimensional space of our weights. In other words, what we are searching for is minima or maxima to optimize our neural net, and we 'search' for it by doing a derivative which tells us which way to go, moving a bit in that direction, then doing that again and again iteratively to find (hopefully) the best weights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This video here goes into all the detail you'd want, and I recommend the entire series as a robust but understandable intro to neural nets: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlcnxUlrtek&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Demystifying Neural Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go and look up 'gradient descent' to get any related material.

First, what many people refer to as &quot;search&quot; is a reflection of how what we call &quot;intelligence&quot; frequently involves searching something:  a physical realm, a &quot;state space&quot; of possible solutions, a &quot;knowledge space&quot; where ideas/facts/concepts/etc. are related as a graph structure, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look up some old papers on computer chess, and you'll see that a lot of that involves searching a &quot;state space&quot;.  As such, search algorithms that are efficient (in terms of time complexity and/or space complexity) have always been important to making advances there.  And while computer chess is just one example, the principle generalizes to many other kinds of problem solving and goal seeking activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/artificialintelligence/nonflash/problemframenf.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a reference&lt;/a&gt; that explains more about some of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note too that &quot;search&quot; is closely related to the idea of &quot;heuristics&quot; in an important way.  Many search problems in the real world are far too complex to solve by exhaustive brute-force search, so humans (and AI's) resort to heuristics to narrow the state space being searched.  Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some more background you might want to read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A* search&lt;/a&gt;, which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other major regard in which something you could call &quot;search&quot; applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as &quot;optimisation&quot; techniques.  This would be things like Hill Climbing, Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing and perhaps even Genetic Algorithms.  These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some function  and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you're trying to minimize the delta between the &quot;correct&quot; answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastEditorUserId="33" LastEditDate="2016-09-08T14:19:26.630" LastActivityDate="2016-09-08T14:19:26.630" CommentCount="9" />

Every problem has an input within some range (the domain) and an output in some other range (codomain).  That is, every problem can be formulated as a kind of map from one space to another, where the source is the givens of the problem, and the destination is the solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brute force&quot; is the algorithm which solves every problem by inspecting every point in the codomain and asking: &quot;Is this the solution?&quot;  Every other algorithm is an attempt to improve on brute force by not searching the entire codomain of possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typical software engineering problems can be solved by algorithms which arrive at the correct solution very quickly (sorting, arithmetic, partition, etc.).  AI problems are generally those for which a strong polynomial  algorithm is not known, and thus, we must settle for approximations.  Basically every common problem that the human brain must solve falls into this category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the problem of moving a multi-jointed robotic arm to pick up an object.  Reverse kinematics does not have unique solutions: there is more than one way to move your hand from a start position to a target position.  This is due to the excessive degrees of freedom in your joints.  If you want to minimize energy usage, then there is a unique solution (due to the asymmetry of joints and muscles).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what if there is an obstacle in the pathway of the minimum-energy solution?  There are many pathways which avoid the obstacle, but again, many of them will have a similar cost.  Even if there is a unique minimum-energy solution, it might not be the most practical to compute.  The brain is the most metabolically expensive organ in the body, so it is not always best to find an optimal solution.  Thus, heuristics come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in all cases, the problem is not: &quot;move your hand&quot; or &quot;move the robot arm.&quot;  The problem is: &quot;search the space of joint rotation sequences which best achieves the goal.&quot;  And even though there is a closed-form solution for the simple minimum-energy case with no obstacles, it is too expensive to compute precisely when a set of cheap heuristics will get you very close with a small fraction of the computational effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If computation were free, then AI would be mere mathematics, and we would always compute the best answer to every question using logic, calculus, physics, at worst, numerical methods when we don't have closed-form solutions.  In reality, time is money, and the time and effort to get an answer is as much a part of the cost as the quality of the solution.  So it is an engineering tradeoff to decide how much effort should be expended in what way to obtain the best answer given the value of the response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, in other words, AI problems are all about searching the space of solutions as quickly as possible to get an answer that is &quot;good enough&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might seem curious that such far-flung problems as natural language recognition and theorem proving would be search problems.  But language parsers strive to determine the meaning of statements via part-of-speech tagging.  A given phrase can be parsed in many different ways, yielding many different interpretations, and the space of parse trees is yet another search problem in deciding which parse tree is the most likely intended meaning by the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A theorem proof is graph starting with axioms, proceeding through lemmas, applying the rules of procedure until the theorem is derived or refuted (by proving its negation).  There are many ways to represent this sequence, but at the end of the day, we are talking about a process of exploring the intermediate proof space and finding the derivation which reaches your goal.

I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp;amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp;amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that are swear words in other cultures for an example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them capture the complexity of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever' at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos / images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Emblems' are gestures which have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; particular movement is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; gesture which means &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production is in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if its not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1467" LastEditorUserId="1467" LastEditDate="2016-09-12T09:43:12.550" LastActivityDate="2016-09-12T09:43:12.550" CommentCount="0" />

The idea of multi-task learning is that a predictor predicting multiple variables (in this case the various Q(s,a1), Q(s,a2), ...) using mostly the same structure (varying only the output weights) will learn more sensible things. Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tile Coding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.&#xA;Now you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions.

If it is supposed to solve a single easy task perfectly and professionally, sure emotions would not be very useful. But if it is supposed to learn random new things, there would be a point that it encounters something it cannot handle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Lee Sedol vs AlphaGo match 4, some pro who has said computer doesn't have emotions previously, commented that maybe AlphaGo has emotions too, and stronger than human. In this case, we know that AlphaGo's crazy behavior isn't caused by some deliberately added things called &quot;emotions&quot;, but a flaw in the algorithm. But it behaves exactly like it has panicked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this happens a lot for an AI. There might be advantages if it could know this itself and think twice if it happens. If AlphaGo could detect the problem and change its strategy, it might play better, or worse. It's not unlikely to play worse if it didn't do any computations for other approaches at all. In case it would play worse, we might say it suffers from having &quot;emotions&quot;, and this might be the reason some people think having emotions could be a flaw of human beings. But that wouldn't be the true cause of the problem. The true cause is it just doesn't know any approaches to guarantee winning, and the change in strategy is only a try to fix the problem. Commentators thinks there are better ways (which also don't guarantee winning but had more chance), but its algorithm isn't capable to find out in this situation. Even for human, the solution to anything related to emotion is unlikely to remove emotions, but some training to make sure you understand the situation enough to act calmly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then someone has to argue about whether this is a kind of emotion or not. We usually don't say small insects have human-like emotions, because we don't understand them and are unwilling to help them. But it's easy to know some of them could panic in desperate situations, just like AlphaGo did. I'd say these reactions are based on the same logic, and they are at least the reason why human-like emotions could be potentially useful. They are just not expressed in human-understandable ways, as they didn't intend to call a human for help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they tries to understand their own behavior, or call someone else for help, it might be good to be exactly human-like. Some pets can sense human emotions and express human-understandable emotion to some degree. The purpose is to interact with humans. They evolved to have this ability because they needed it at some point. It's likely a full strong AI would need it too. Also note that, the opposite of having full emotions might be becoming crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is probably a quick way to lose any trust if someone just implement emotions imitating humans with little understanding right away in the first generations, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Weak AIs&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But is there any purposes for them to have emotions before someone wanted a strong AI? I'd say no, there isn't any inherent reasons that they must have emotions. But inevitably someone will want to implement imitated emotions anyway. Whether &quot;we&quot; need them to have emotions is just nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact is even some programs without any intelligence contained some &quot;emotional&quot; elements in their user interfaces. They may look unprofessional, but not every task needs professionality so they could be perfectly acceptable. They are just like the emotions in musics and arts. Someone will design their weak AI in this way too. But they are not really the AIs' emotions, but their creators'. If you feel better or worse because of their emotions, you won't treat individul AIs so differently, but this model or brand as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively someone could plant some personallities like in a role-playing game there. Again, there isn't a reason they must have that, but inevitably someone will do it, because they obviously had some market when a role-playing game does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In either cases, the emotions don't really originate from the AI itself. And it would be easy to implement, because a human won't expect them to be exactly like a human, but tries to understand what they intended to mean. It could be much easier to accept these emotions realizing this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Aspects of emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about posting some original research here. I made a list of emotions in 2012 and from which I see 4 aspects of emotions. If they are all implemented, I'd say they are exactly the same emotions as of humans. They don't seem real if only some of them are implemented, but that doesn't mean they are completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reason, or the original logical problem that the AI cannot solve. AlphaGo already had the reason, but nothing else. If I have to make an accurate definition, I'd say it's the state that multiple equally important heuristics disagreeing with each other.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The context, or which part of the current approach is considered not working well and should probably be replaced. This distinguishes sadness-related, worry-related and passionate-related.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The current state, or whether it feels leading, or whether its belief or the fact is supposed to turn bad first (or was bad all along) if things go wrong. This distinguishes sadness-related, love-related and proud-related.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The plan or request. I suppose some domesticated pets already had this. And I suppose these had some fixed patterns which is not too difficult to have. Even arts can contain them easily. Unlike the reasons, these are not likely inherent in any algorithms, and multiple of them can appear together.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Who supposedly had the responsibility if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes curiosity, rage and sadness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the supposed plan if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes disappointment, sadness and surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The source. Without context, even a human cannot reliably tell someone is crying for being moved or thankful, or smiling for some kind of embarrassment. In most other cases there aren't even words describing them. It doesn't make that much difference if an AI doesn't distinguish or show this specially. It's likely they would learn these automatically (and inaccurately as a human) at the point they could learn to understand human languages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The measurements, such as how urgent or important the problem is, or even how likely the emotions are true. I'd say it cannot be implemented in the AI. Humans don't need to respect them even if they are exactly like humans. But humans will learn how to understand an AI if that really matters, even if they are not like humans at all. In fact, I feel that some of the extremely weak emotions (such as thinking something is too stupid and boring that you don't know how to comment) exist almost exclusively in emoticons, where someone intend to show you exactly this emotion, and hardly noticeable in real life or any complex scenerios. I supposed this could also be the case in the beginning for AIs. In the worst case, they are firstly conventionally known as &quot;emotions&quot; since emoticons works in these cases, so it's easier to group them together, but very few people seriously think they are, just like the example I gave.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when strong AIs become possible, none of these would be unreachable, though there might be a lot of work to make the connections. So I'd say if there would be the need for strong AIs, they absolutely would have emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1424" LastActivityDate="2016-09-09T22:33:33.240" CommentCount="0" />

Yes, you can find instances of geniuses like Ramanujan solving complex problem during or after a dream state, but those involve partial consciousness. You don't see guys like Einstein coming up with the theory of relativity while in a coma; the Founding Fathers didn't write the Declaration of Independence while sleep-walking; in fact, you can't even find instances of housewives putting together their shopping list for the week during deep delta-wave sleep. This is predicated on a hard definition of intelligence, requiring the use of reason; no one says, &quot;That fly is intelligent&quot; or &quot;that squirrel is intelligent&quot; precisely because neither is capable of using reason. This is a very high bar for A.I., but it is the common sense definition used by ordinary people as a matter of practicality, in everyday speech.  Likewise, in practice, everyone assumes consciousness is necessary to the exercise of that kind of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, we can come up with another common-sense based criterion for judging objections to this argument, particularly the solipsist one, based on 3 elements: 1) practicality; 2) the effect the objections have on those who hold them sincerely; and 3) the effect that actions based on those beliefs have on others. &lt;strong&gt;It's going to take me several paragraphs to make this case, but the length is necessary if I want to make the case in a complete, thorough fashion&lt;/strong&gt;. It is true that we cannot prove that another human being possesses consciousness, if our standard is absolute proof. We cannot, in fact, provide absolute proof for anything; there's always room for some objection, no matter how ridiculous or trifling. As some philosophers have pointed out, perhaps all of reality as we know it is just a dream, or the product of some long, involved conspiracy like the plot of the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show. The key to meeting such objections is that they require an infinite regress of increasingly untenable objections, whose likelihood plunges with each additional step required to justify such unreasonable doubts; I've always wondered if we could come up with a &quot;Ridiculousness Metric&quot; for Machine Learning based on the cardinality of such objections (or the pickiness of fuzzy sets). If we were to allow critics to stick their foot in the door with all manner of unreasonable objections, it would be impossible to close any debate. The human race would be paralyzed in inaction because nothing would be decidable; but as the rock band Rush once pointed out, &quot;If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.&quot; At some point we must apply a test to decide such things, even in the absence of absolute proof; refusal to apply a test also constitutes a choice. Settling an argument of this kind is like a game  of the Chinese game Go - once the other player's surrounded and has no more moves left to make, the game is over; if a person's evidence has debunked and they have no further justifications left, then we can conclude that they're acting unreasonably. There are people running around claiming the Holocaust never happened, or the Flat Earth Society, etc., but their existence shouldn't and doesn't stop us from taking action contrary to their ideas. We can debunk the objections of cranks like the Flat Earth Society beyond a reasonable doubt because in the end, they simply can't answer all of our rebuttals. I’m glad that qualia and Philosophical Zombies were brought up because they make for interesting conversation and food for thought, but solipsism is acted upon as rarely as the ideas of the Flat Earth Society precisely because the incomplete evidence we &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; have runs against it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As G.K. Chesterton (a.k.a. &quot;The Apostle of Common Sense&quot;) points out in his classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;, radical doubt of the kind many classical philosophers preached is not a path to wisdom but to madness; once we go beyond a reasonable doubt, we end up acting unreasonably. He says that in the absence of absolute proof we can fall back on another secondary form of evidence: whether a person's philosophy leads a man to Hanwell, the infamous British mental institution. Chesterton makes a good case that when people actually act on ideas like solipsism (rather than merely debating them in a pedantic manner in an ivy-covered classroom) they go mad The Philosophical Zombie argument is close to solipsism, which is actually one of the diagnostic criteria for certain forms of schizophrenia. The dehumanization that occurs when radical doubt is applied to qualia is also intimately tied in with sociopathic behavior, Although GKC does not cite his scary example directly, Rene Descartes was himself living proof. He was a brilliant mathematician who is still cheered for doubting all except his own existence, with the famous maxim &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; But Descartes also used to carry a mannequin of his dead sister with him to European cafes, where he could be seen chatting with it. The gist of all this is that we can judge the worth of an idea by how it affects the well-being of the believer, or by how they in turn affect others through ethical choices based on those beliefs. When people actually act on radical doubt of the kind expressed in solipsism and denial of common qualia, it often has a bad effect on them and others they come in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a roundabout way, the A.I. community also faces a quite serious risk - perhaps a permanent temptation - towards making the opposite mistake, of ascribing common qualia, consciousness and the like to its Machine Learning products without adequate proof. I recently heard a case made on shockingly bad logical grounds by well-respected academics to the effect that plants possess &quot;intelligence,&quot; based on really weak definitions and clear confusion with self-organization. We cannot provide absolute proof that a rock doesn't have intelligence, which amounts to the old problem of disproving a negative. Thankfully, few men actually act on such beliefs at present, because when they do, they end up losing their minds. If we take such arguments seriously, we might see laws passed to protect the kind of Pet Rocks that were popular in the '70s (I'm still upset that mine was stolen LOL). It would be a lot easier, however, to make the same mistake of ascribing consciousness, intelligence and other such qualities to a state-of-the-art machine, because of wishful thinking, hubris, the lofty credentials of the inventors, the influence of science fiction and the modern love affair with technology. In the future, I have little doubt that we'll have Cargo Cult of A.I. - perhaps legally protected like some kind of endangered species, with civil rights, but having no more consciousness, soul or actual intelligence than a rock. Don't quote me on this, but I believe Rod Serling once wrote a story to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid this fate is to stick to the common sense interpretations and definitions of these things, which we keep backing away from in large part because they set a very high bar for A.I. that we may never be able to surpass in our lifetimes, if ever. Perhaps A.I. isn't even logically possible, at any level of technology; I recall a few proofs that can be interpreted to that effect. Those high but reasonable standards may be increasingly difficult to stick to if Chesterton and colleagues like Hilaire Belloc and Arnold Lunn were correct in their assessment that the use of reason has actually been breaking down in Western civilization, at least as far back as the Enlightenment; Lunn's 1931 book The Flight from Reason is a classic in this regard and has yet to be rebutted.  This historical trend is a broad topic in and of itself - but suffice it to say that the denial of reason and obsession with technology are both directly relevant in obvious ways to the field of A.I. If the Flight from Reason is still under way, then we will be increasingly tempted to resort to feckless, facile objections in order to demote the use of reason and indispensable qualities like consciousness in our definitions of A.I., but come up with increasingly weak criteria for proving it; simultaneously, our technology will continue to improve, thereby boosting the &quot;Artificial&quot; side of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: if I didn't think we can do some really exciting things with A.I., I wouldn't be here. But most of them can be achieved without ever replicating actual human intelligence, by solving whole classes of tangential problems that are difficult for humans to think about, but which do not require consciousness or the use of reason that marks human intelligence. The image recognition capabilities of convolutional neural nets are one example, for instance; if we want human intelligence, we can always manufacture it through the easiest, most economical and time-tested way, by having babies. Perhaps these tangential forms of A.I. should be enough for us for now. We cannot inject the use of reason into our machines if we do not possess enough of it ourselves to decide whether reason is necessary for A.I., or even to discern what it consists of. We can't engineer or deprecate consciousness for A.I. till we're conscious of its significance. I'd wager, however, that everyone reading this thread and weighing intelligent responses is doing so in a conscious state. That in and of itself ought to answer our question satisfactorily for now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1427" LastActivityDate="2016-09-09T23:18:10.873" CommentCount="0" />

Ruthless pursuit of the highest performance would involve taking control of all relevant resources (including other agents), demolishing barriers to the goal, thwarting those who would interfere with progress, and carrying out each possibly-useful idea/desire to completion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, yes, an AI's behavior and personality are programmable, either explicitly or through some kind of emergence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="75" LastActivityDate="2016-09-10T20:46:07.753" CommentCount="0" />

There may be only one scenario: Global destruction: Extreme scenario where everything supporting the existence of an AI disappears. This is equivalent to death in natural life, and low probability. It means all AIs die at once (as well as us).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also do not know the degree and form of embodiment necessary for AGIs.

Then a definition closer to natural life death may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We see arguments for two other scenarios, that I &lt;em&gt;refute&lt;/em&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Static Death&quot;: An AI is still &quot;defined&quot; or &quot;saved&quot; somewhere (whatever it means actually), but it is not authorized or able to use resources. Assuming an AI is made of hardware and software, it is like a program stored on a disk, but without permission to run. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dynamic Death&quot;: Under the same characterization of AI as hardware and software, dynamic death is the invalidation of progress akin to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;strong liveness properties&lt;/a&gt;, where an AI is trapped in an infinite loop (or a void loop), in a form of &quot;active death&quot;, as what happens to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; in Greek mythology. This is different from static death, as the AI &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; uses dynamic resources, although it cannot make progress. Continuing under the same assumptions, such AI could be &quot;loaded&quot; in main memory, or locked waiting for inputs or outputs to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in these two scenarios, &lt;em&gt;rebirth&lt;/em&gt; is possible, and they also subsume that there is an entity that can &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt; conditions for rebirth, or preventing it completely. Would this entity be an &quot;admin&quot;, a god, other AIs, or a human is another question, really.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The terms &quot;death&quot; and &quot;rebirth&quot; here could just be changed for &quot;imprisoning&quot;, where the dynamic version would be like our human prisons, and the static version would be like SciFi cryogeny. This is a bit of a stretch, but we can see an equivalence, and no good reason to qualify these two scenarios as deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, death for AI seems to be an exceptional, singular scenario, so AI cannot die &lt;em&gt;in practice&lt;/em&gt;, except if we are wrong on how we think we can make AGIs.

Another is psychological continuity, which requires the continuance of your consciousness - by which is meant your thoughts, ideas, memories, plans, beliefs, and so on. The third possibility is the continued existence of some kind of immaterial part of you, which might be called the soul*. Of course, it may be the case that a combination of one or more types of these continuity is required for you to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other answers assumes that life is based on &quot;psychological continuity&quot;, and looks at what might disrupt this &quot;continuity&quot;.

So far the implementation is only used for anomaly detection, which is kind of the opposite of what you really want to do. Instead of extracting the understanding, you'll extract the instances which the your artificial cortex doesn't understand. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is in what way Hawkins's framework falls short. What are the concrete or conceptual problems that so far prevent his theory from working in practice? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2227" LastActivityDate="2016-09-21T20:36:17.423" Title="What are the flaws in Jeff Hawkins's AI framework?"

I still am, despite the fact that I have a few reservations about some of his philosophical musings on the meanings of consciousness, free will and other such topics. I won't elaborate on those misgivings here because they're not germane to the main, overwhelming reason why HTM nets haven't succeeded as much as expected to date: to my knowledge, Numenta has only implemented a truncated version of his vision. They left out most of the prediction architecture, which plays such a critical role in Hawkins' theories. As Gerod M. Bonhoff put it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;an excellent thesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; on HTMs, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In March of 2007, Numenta released what they claimed was a “research&#xA;  implementation” of HTM theory called Numenta Platform for Intelligent&#xA;  Computing (NuPIC). The algorithm used by NuPIC at this time is called&#xA;  “Zeta1.” NuPIC was released as an open source software platform and&#xA;  binary files of the Zeta1 algorithm. Because of licensing, this paper&#xA;  is not allowed to discuss the proprietary implementation aspects of&#xA;  Numenta’s Zeta1 algorithm. There are, however, generalized&#xA;  concepts of implementation that can be discussed freely. The two most&#xA;  important of these are how the Zeta 1 algorithm (encapsulated in each&#xA;  memory node of the network hierarchy) implements HTM theory. To&#xA;  implement any theory in software, an algorithmic design for each&#xA;  aspect of the theory must be addressed. The most important design&#xA;  decision Numenta adopted was to eliminate feedback within the&#xA;  hierarchy and instead choose to simulate this theoretical concept&#xA;  using only data pooling algorithms for weighting. This decision is&#xA;  immediately suspect and violates key concepts of HTM. Feedback,&#xA;  Hawkins’ insists, is vital to cortical function and central to his&#xA;  theories. Still, Numenta claims that most HTM applicable problems can&#xA;  be solved using their implementation and proprietary pooling&#xA;  algorithms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still learning the ropes in this field and cannot say whether or not Numenta has since scrapped this approach in favor of a full implementation of Hawkins' ideas, especially the all-important prediction architecture. Even if they have, this design decision has probably delayed adoption by many years. That's not a criticism per se; perhaps the computational costs of tracking prediction values and updating them on the fly were too much to bear at the time, on top of the ordinary costs of processing neural nets, leaving them with no other path except to try half-measures like their proprietary pooling mechanisms. Nevertheless, all of the best research papers I've read on the topic since then have chosen to reimplement the algorithms rather than relying on Numenta's platform, typically because of the missing prediction features. Cases in point include Bonhoff's thesis and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf&quot;&gt;Maltoni's technical report for the University of Bologna Biometric System Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. In all of those cases, however, there is no readily accessible software for putting their variant HTMs to immediate use (as far as I know). The gist of all this is that like G.K. Chesterton's famous maxim about Christianity, &quot;HTMs have not been tried and found wanting; they have been found difficult, and left untried.&quot; Since Numenta left out the prediction steps, I assume that they would be the main stumbling blocks awaiting anyone who wants to code Hawkins' full vision of what an HTM should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;Bonhoff, Gerod M., 2008, Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Detecting Anomalous Network Activity.

This is basically a form of preprocessing in which a text is recursively reduced to a smaller number of word vectors until only one is left - your input, which is supposed to encode the whole text. This makes a lot of sense from a linguistic point of view if your input consists of sentences (which can vary a lot in size), because sentences are structured recursively (For example the word vector for &quot;the man&quot;, should be similar to the word vector for &quot;the man who mistook his wife for a hat&quot;, because noun phrases act like nouns etc.).

You can think of them as interpolating between training examples, and benefitting from all of the mathematical guarantees and provisos as other statistical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extrapolative thinkers learn to manipulate underlying principles, which allows them to combine those principles in previously unconsidered ways.

You can think of them as extrapolating beyond training examples (indeed, many of them don't even require training examples, or use those examples to infer underlying principles).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The promise of extrapolative thinkers is that they can come up with these 'lateral' solutions much more quickly than people would be able to. The problem with these extrapolative thinkers is that they only use the spoken principles, not any unspoken ones that might seem too obvious to mention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An attribute of solutions to optimization problems is that the feature vector is often 'extreme' in some way. In linear programming, at least one vertex of the feasible solution space will be optimal, and so simple solution methods find an optimal vertex (which is almost infeasible by nature of being a vertex).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As another example, the minimum-fuel solution for moving a spacecraft from one position to another is called '&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control&quot;&gt;bang-bang&lt;/a&gt;,' where you accelerate the craft as quickly as possible at the beginning and end of the trajectory, coasting at maximum speed in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While a virtue when the system is correctly understood (bang-bang &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; optimal for many cases), this is catastrophic when the system is incorrectly understood. My favorite example here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws14/Ideen-der-Informatik/Dantzig-Diet.pdf&quot;&gt;Dantzig's diet problem&lt;/a&gt; (discussion starts on page 5 of the pdf), where he tries to optimize his diet using math. Under his first constraint set, he's supposed to drink 500 gallons of vinegar a day. Under his second, 200 bouillon cubes. Under his third, two pounds of bran. The considerations that make those obviously bad ideas aren't baked into the system, and so the system innocently suggests them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can completely encode the knowledge and values that a person uses to judge these plans into the AI, then extrapolative systems are as safe as that person. They'll be able to consider and reject the wrong sort of extreme plans, and leave you with the right sort of extreme plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you can't, then it does make sense to not build an extrapolative decision-maker, and instead build an interpolative one.

To summarize, calcium affects the regulation, stimulation and transmission of electrical activity as well as the destruction of neurones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From my study of neural networks, there does not seem to be a calcium equivalent.  Having one would imply that the functions, connections and weights in an artificial network are configured during the training and execution process and can change over time.   I understand that back-propagation is used to train the weights, but have not seen anything that trains the function nor the connections (although a zero weight could imply no connection).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of such a network (or training algorithm)?

The travel may take days -&#xA;  of real time too, so the path must be saved to disk, and the space in&#xA;  the save file for custom data like this is severely limited.

This allows humans to do what they really want instead...such as hobbies? And what if the hobbies of the future are the &quot;jobs&quot; of today: shrinks, movie directors, politicians, soldiers, etc., etc. Instead of working for a paycheck, you're working in these jobs on a volunteer basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, no automation is being necessary to eliminate these hobbyists (no matter how good a bot is, &lt;em&gt;free labor&lt;/em&gt; will always prevail), but they're not really jobs, are they? The bot is the one that is producing real value, and subsidizing the hobbies of all these other people. The idea of a &quot;job&quot; itself could be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think this scenario is likely either (in fact, I'd probably think it's just AI snake oil that will never actually happen).

Prior to a reason for knowledge representation, there is no knowledge representation.

However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence.

While such data is increasingly available, Am still unable to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms that cause diseases. The challenge is due to the multifactorial nature of disease. The same disease can be caused by mutations in different genes or different pathogenic pathways. Unfortunately, current data analysis approaches fail to capture the complex relationship between disease and the vast amount of information in the molecular data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of my research is to resolve this challenge with other professional researchers by developing machine learning algorithms that jointly model sophisticated interactions among many variables such as genetic variation, genes, pathways and disease, and robustly learn from vast amounts of data in order to better understand and treat disease. An approach that can robustly infer the pathways that can define disease processes will dramatically improve our understanding of diseases and advance personalized medicine in its treatment.

The definition of life in biological terms is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter where the distinguishing criteria are the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Does artificial intelligence &quot;grow&quot;?  Indeed, I can program a machine learning program to grow with every input taken in.  In the loosest sense, we can say that artificial intelligence does grow, but does it biologically? If we look at the definition for growth of a living thing, it means to undergo natural development by increasing in size and changing physically or the progress to maturity.  All living organisms undergo growth.   Even though at the simplest level, cells are a series of chemical processes, cells are a very complicated set of chemical processes that are still not fully understood by scientists across the world.  Every cell has genetic material that can be replicated, excised, used for RNA, proteins, and that is subject to epigenetic regulation. &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cell division&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does artificial intelligence undergo the same process of cell division?  No.  If I wanted to, I could write a program that undergoes a simple for-loop (print i from 1 to 100), replicates itself at a certain point (i=50) to produce the same program perhaps with some variation that will execute itself, and terminates (dies) at the end of the for loop.  The program, by an extremely loose definition supported by philosophy but not by biology, lives.  However, in scientific terms (and the correct interpretation), artificial intelligence is not living.  Artificial intelligence can be seen to be similar to viruses which are considered to be acellular and essential to life but not living.  Viruses are encapsulated DNA and RNA that undergo processes of growth, reproduction, and functionality but because they lack the ability to undergo the cell division cycle, are considered non-living.  At the very basis of the scientific definition of life is the cell replication cycle.  Artificial intelligence and viruses are not able to undergo the cell cycle.  Viruses need to infect other cells in order to reproduce but do not have their own, autonomous cycle.  At the end of the day, if you can argue that viruses are alive, you can argue that artificial intelligence is alive as well.  For the scientific definition of life, artificial intelligence must undergo the process of cell division and replication.

or &lt;em&gt;more specifically, how does curiosity work&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With more research on Google I was led to &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; specifically addressing that question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How Curiosity works:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are &lt;em&gt;drive theory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;incongruity theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Drive Theory simply states, we have a &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incongruity Theory&lt;/em&gt; states that we are able identify things we &lt;em&gt;do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL&lt;/em&gt; which leads us to asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a &lt;em&gt;missing/unclear attribute or characteristic&lt;/em&gt; on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;My Own Inductive Theory on Curiousity&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is that your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously is looking at &lt;em&gt;other similar ideas&lt;/em&gt; and looking at &lt;em&gt;their &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;concisely known&lt;/strong&gt; attributes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Solution Based on the Theory:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what I have designed is fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An idea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;represented programmatically as an &lt;strong&gt;object&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The object&lt;/em&gt; has certain characteristics known as &lt;em&gt;properties&lt;/em&gt; (which are those attributes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The program reads over those properties and finds other objects &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; to it based on those properties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object &lt;em&gt;does not have&lt;/em&gt;, and therefore marks those properties as unknown on the original object, making it possible to apply &lt;em&gt;incongruity theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Collecting Information:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This process is already achieved with &lt;em&gt;machine learning&lt;/em&gt;, any questions on this subprocess of design need to be addressed to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning&quot;&gt;machine-learning tag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Brainstorming Ideas:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing Ideas:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to &lt;em&gt;induce&lt;/em&gt; whether an idea is feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Developing Solutions:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where IDE-development knowledge comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to make product development&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;easy and understandable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;to an AI&lt;/em&gt;, we have to choose a type of product that could be developed &lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's Note:&lt;/em&gt; I do recommend this in order to keep the testing of the algorithms for the previous processes really simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Easily Designed Product that I Selected for Designing an Algorithm:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I am providing this to you, so you can model a way to reproduce this process for the Intelligence you would like to build.

I think you guys are skipping the fact that the neural network only really is saying truly from a programmatic standpoint that &quot;this is most like&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, while we can list the above image examples as &quot;abstract art&quot;, they definitively are most like was is listed. Remember learning algorithms have a scope on what they recognize as an object and if you look at all the above examples... and think about the scope of the algorithum... these make sense (even the ones at a glance we would recognize as white noise). In Vishnu example of the numbers, if you fuzz your eyes and bring the images out of focus, you can actually in every case spot patterns that really closely reflect the numbers in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem that is being shown here is that the algorithm appears to not have a &quot;unknown case&quot;. Basically when the pattern recognition says that it doesn't exist in the output scope. (so a final output node group that says this is nothing that I know off). For example, people do this as well, as it's one thing humans and learning algorithms have in common.

They did however manage to get a version of the original NTM and several variants up and running, plus recorded the same magnitude of performance improvement.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00036.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• Unlike the original NTM, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; tested a version of reinforcement learning which was not differentiable; that may be why they were unable to solve several of the programming-like tasts, like Repeat-Copy, unless the controller wasn't confined to moving forwards. Their results were nevertheless good enough to lend support to the idea of NTMs. A more recent revision of their paper is apparently available, which I have yet to read, so perhaps some of their variant's problems have been solved.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• Instead of testing the original flavor of NTM against ordinary neural nets like LSTMs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; pitted it against several more advanced NTM memory structures. They got good results on the same type of programming-like tasks that Graves et al. tested, but I don't think they were using the same dataset (it's hard to tell from the way their study is written just what datasets they were operating on).&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• On p. 8 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;, an NTM clearly outperforms several LSTM, feed-forward and nearest-neighbor based schemes on an Omniglot character recognition dataset. An alternative approach to external memory cooked up by the authors clearly beats it, but it still obviously performs well. The authors seem to belong to a rival team at Google, so that might be an issue when assessing replicability.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• On p. 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf&quot;&gt;these authors&lt;/a&gt; reported getting better generalization on &quot;very large sequences&quot; in a test of copy tasks, using a much smaller NTM network they evolved with the genetic NEAT algorithm, which dynamically grows topologies.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NTMs are fairly new so there hasn't been much time to stringently replicate the original research yet, I suppose. The handful of papers I skimmed over the summer, however, seem to lend support to their experimental results; I have yet to see any that report anything but excellent performance. Of course I have an availability bias, since I only read the pdfs I could easily find in a careless Internet search. From that small sample it seems that most of the follow-up research has been focused on extending the concept, not replication, which would explain the lack of replicability data. I hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Graves, Alex; Wayne, Greg and Danihelka, Ivo, 2014, &quot;Neural Turing Machines,&quot; published Dec. 10, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00036.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Gulcehre, Caglar; Chandar, Sarath; Choy, Kyunghyun and Bengio, Yoshua, 2016, &quot;Dynamic Neural Turing machine with Soft and Hard Addressing Schemes,&quot; published June 30, 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Zaremba, Wojciech and Sutskever, Ilya, 2015, &quot;Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines,&quot; published May 4, 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Zhang; Wei; Yu, Yang and Zhou, Bowen, 2015, &quot;Structured Memory for Neural Turing Machines,&quot; published Oct. 25, 2015.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Santoro, Adam; Bartunov, Sergey; Botvinick, Matthew; Wierstra, Daan and Lillicrap, Timothy, 2016, &quot;One-Shot Learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks,&quot; published May 19, 2016.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Boll Greve, Rasmus; Jacobsen, Emil Juul and Sebastian Risi, date unknown, &quot;Evolving Neural Turing Machines.&quot; No publisher listed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All except (perhaps) Boll Greve et al. were published at the Cornell Univeristy Library arXiv.org Repository: Ithaca, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1427" LastActivityDate="2016-10-28T09:00:13.520" CommentCount="0" />

Then a thermostat might have the conscious level of 1 as it can sense when the surrounding is hot or cold and then take decision. Similarly a rat can have a conscious level 7 (or something). And the levels are of exponential order (not a linear scale). Similarly you can develop an AI program and check what level of consciousness it has achieved. Then you can decide whether it is living or not. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) will have a lower level of consciousness level than AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).

If you want to respond to the threat with a feasible computational effort, you'll have to treat the wolf as one entity. Providing these kinds of entities or concepts from the raw bits and bytes of input is what a hierarchical representation does. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this is quite intuitive for sensory information: lashes, iris, eyebrow make up an eye, eyes, nose and mouth make up a face and so on. What is less obvious, is the fact that motor control works exactly the same way! Only in reverse. If you want to lift your arm, you'll just lift it. But for your brain to actually realise this move, the high level command has to be broken down into precise signals for every muscle involved. And this is done by propagating the command down the hierarchy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the brain these two functions are strongly intertwined. You use constant sensory feedback to adapt your motor control and in many cases you'd be incapable of integrating your stream of sensory data into a coherent representation if you didn't have the additional information of what your body is doing to change that stream of data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Saccades&lt;/a&gt; are a good example for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course this doesn't mean that our cognitive functions are dependent on the processing of sensorimotor information. I would be surprised if a pure thinking machine wouldn't be possible. There is however a specific version of this &quot;embodied intelligence hypothesis&quot; that sounds plausible to me: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creating high level cognitive concepts with unsupervised learning is a really difficult problem. Creating high level motor representation might be significantly easier. The reason is that there is more immediate useful feedback. I have been thinking about how to provide a scaffolding for the learning of a hierarchy of cognitive concepts and one thing I could imagine is that high level cognitive concepts basically hitch a ride with the motor concepts. Just think of what a pantomime can express with movement alone. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2227" LastActivityDate="2016-10-31T13:47:58.610" CommentCount="3" />

If having one light-sensitive cell connected to one muscle cell makes an organism more likely to survive, then you have the building blocks to add a second layer without inventing any new sorts of cells, because you already have the information-processing connector.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are convenient for evolution because their organization matches the hierarchical nature of the problem &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the same kind of cell is used everywhere. All you need is dendrites to receive signals, a way to compute the threshold and trigger if the received signal is higher, axons that can make it to other cells, and then branches at the end of the axon to serve as multipliers. You can arbitrarily extend the depth and breadth of the network just by adding more cells.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are convenient for artificial sensorimotor control because they give you, in memory, access to lots of intermediate values. They're also convenient for the same reasons evolution found them convenient--we can just say what we expect the structure of the robotic control will look like, provide training data, and then eventually have a robot that works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's lots of robotics where the control system is designed instead of learned. To take a very simple example, one &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use machine learning on the thermostat problem, to learn what temperatures require the heater to be turned on and what temperatures require the air conditioner to be turned on. But this would be extra work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a less robust system than just designing the optimal control system ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In control theory, there's a concept called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;adaptive control&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the state space parameters for the control system is a property of the system. For example, imagine a satellite; typically we think of the state space of the system as the position and velocity of the satellite in three dimensions, so six total coordinates. There's then a set of differential equations that describe how the satellite will move over time, and what would happen if we used the actuators on the satellite to change its velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But part of those differential equations is the inertia of the satellite. That is, how much fuel we need to expend and how it'll affect the rotation and translation of the satellite depends on where the weight of the satellite is located. And this can change over time, as fuel is consumed or if it wasn't correctly measured to begin with. Adaptive control adds new states to the system to track the inertia, and then simultaneously updates its estimate of the inertia and uses that estimate to plan what controls are necessary to move to a desired position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could imagine solving this problem with neural networks, but we can fairly easily calculate the optimal solution from first principles. In that case, we don't need neural network-based control, but the end result will look something like it from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2016-10-31T17:32:53.907" CommentCount="8" />

What makes this game different from other board game (like Chess, Reversi, etc.) is that moves are often based on intuition.

Every move uses certain heuristics, strategy and/ or tricks. This is not the case with Go. Some moves are often taken because of intuition.

For example, development of human-like natural language processing (NLP) is necessary for intelligent agent to pass any verbal tests, or even non-verbal tests that requires processing of sentences of human language. Famous test that tests intelligence by asking questions in natural language and expects answers in the same form is Turing test. NLP still struggles with many (basic) human skills like listening, speaking, parsing and forming sentences. No one knows when we'll have system that can do these things as good as human. Since this system is crucial, but also far from human-like it's likely cause of delay in developing AI that passes intelligence test. Are these problems AI-hard? Do we need to develop strong AI to solve them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can look at speech and listening as interfaces used for expressing and affecting inner processes of human brain. Same goes for other senses like eyesight which is being approximated by computer vision.

There are a number of ways you might try to do this, and I'm not aware of any published science analyzing these different choices.  The key is that the set of learned parameters needs to be shared between the different inputs sizes.  While convolutions can be applied at different images sizes, ultimately they always get converted to a single vector to make predictions with, and the size of that vector will depend on the geometries of the inputs, convolutions and pooling layers.  You'd probably want to dynamically change the pooling layers based on the input geometry and leave the convolutions the same, since the convolutional layers have parameters and pooling usually doesn't.  So on bigger images you pool more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practically you'd want to group together similarly (identically) sized images together into minibatches for efficient processing.

Take for example an artificial intelligence attempting to determine the meaning of a sarcastic sentence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally spoken, the sentence &quot;That's just what I needed today!&quot; can be the expression of very different feelings. In one instance, a happy individual finding an item that had been lost for some time could be excited or cheered up from the event, and exclaim that this moment of triumph was exactly what their day needed to continue to be happy. On the other hand, a disgruntled office employee having a rough day could accidentally worsen his situation by spilling hot coffee on himself, and sarcastically exclaim that this further annoyance was exactly what he needed today. This sentence should in this situation be interpreted as the man expressing that spilling coffee on himself made his bad day worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one small example explaining the reason linguistic analysis is difficult for artificial intelligence. When this example is spoken, small tonal fluctuations and indicators are extremely difficult for an AI with a microphone to detect accurately; and if the sentence was simply read, without context how &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; one example be discernible from the other?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rick Briggs suggests that Sanskrit, a form of communication sacred to Hinduism, is a naturally spoken language with mechanics and grammatical rules that would allow an artificial intelligence to more accurately interpret sentences during linguistic analysis.

Even if we were to develop the AGI, it wouldn't necessarily be useful to enable/equip/motivate? it to have the deception abilities required for the Turing test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2329" LastActivityDate="2016-12-07T17:20:06.900" CommentCount="0" />
