That would be accompanied by vector W that would represent the weights adjusted using Gradient Descent.</p><br><br><p>Question is: will this work?? I am asking for 2 reasons. One is that I am not so sure about that posX and posY since it can be 0 and if I multiply it by the weights vector then how could be resulting reward anything but 0?

"<p>Background:<br>I've been interested in, and reading about, Neural Networks for several years, but I haven't gotten around to testing them out until recently. Both for fun and to increase my understanding, I tried to write a class library from scratch in .Net.<br>For tests, I've tried some simple functions, such as generating output identical to the input, working with the MNIST dataset, and a few binary functions (two input OR, AND and XOR, with two outputs: one for true, one for false).<br>Everything seemed fine when I used a sigmoid function as the activation function but, reading of the ReLUs I decided to switch over for speed.</p><br><br><p>My current problem is that, when I switch to using ReLUs, I found that I was unable to train a network of any complexity (tested from as few as 2 internal nodes up to a mesh of 100x100 nodes) to correctly function as an XOR gate.

"<p>In October 2014, Dr. Mark Riedl published an approach to testing AI intelligence, called <a href=<dq>http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6142v3.pdf<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>the <dq>Lovelace Test 2.0<dq></a>, after being inspired by the <a href=<dq>http://kryten.mm.rpi.edu/lovelace.pdf<dq> rel=<dq>nofollow<dq>>original Lovelace Test</a> (published in 2001). Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.</p><br><br><p>The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:</p><br>  <br>  <ul><br>  <li><p>a must create an artifact o of type t;</p></li><br>  <li><p>o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is<br>  any criterion expressible in natural language;</p></li><br>  <li><p>a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied<br>  that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and</p></li><br>  <li><p>a human referee r determines the combination of t and C<br>  to not be unrealistic for an average human.</p></li><br>  </ul><br></blockquote><br><br><p>Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to <em>compare</em> the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.</p><br><br><p>However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result).</p><br>","2095","0"

"<blockquote><br>  <p>Artificial Intelligence is a rather pernicious label to attach to a very mixed bunch of activities, and one could argue that the sooner we forget it the better.

I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria.

"<p>This is a question about a nomenclature - we already have the algorithm/solution, but we're not sure whether it qualifies as utilizing heuristics or not.</p><br><br><hr><br><br><p>feel free to skip the problem explanation:</p><br><br><blockquote><br>  <p>A friend is writing a path-finding algorithm - an autopilot for an<br>  (off-road) vehicle in a computer game. This is a pretty classic<br>  problem - he finds a viable, not necessarily optimal but <dq>good enough<dq><br>  route using the A* algorithm, by taking the terrain layout and vehicle<br>  capabilities into account, and modifying a direct (straight) line path<br>  to account for these. The whole map is known a'priori and invariant,<br>  though the start and destination are arbitrary (user-chosen) and the<br>  path is not guaranteed to exist at all.</p><br>  <br>  <p>This cookie-cutter approach comes with a twist: limited storage space.<br>  We can afford some more volatile memory on start, but we should free<br>  most of it once the route has been found. The travel may take days -<br>  of real time too, so the path must be saved to disk, and the space in<br>  the save file for custom data like this is severely limited. Too<br>  limited to save all the waypoints - even after culling trivial<br>  solution waypoints ('continue straight ahead'), and by a rather large<br>  margin, order of 20<percent> the size of our data set.</p><br>  <br>  <p>A solution we came up with is to calculate the route once on start,<br>  then 'forget' all the trivial and 90<percent> of the non-trivial waypoints.<br>  This both serves as a proof that a solution exists, and provides a set<br>  of points reaching which, in sequence, guarantees the route will take<br>  us to the destination.</p><br>  <br>  <p>Once the vehicle reaches a waypoint, the route to the next one is<br>  calculated again, from scratch. It's known to exist and be correct<br>  (because we did it once, and it was correct), it doesn't put too much<br>  strain on the CPU and the memory (it's only about 10<percent> the total route<br>  length) and it doesn't need to go into permanent storage (restarting<br>  from any point along the path is just a subset of the solution<br>  connecting two saved waypoints).</p><br></blockquote><br><br><hr><br><br><p>Now for the actual question:</p><br><br><p>The pathfinding algorithm follows a sparse set of waypoints which by themselves are not nearly sufficient as a route, but allow for easy, efficient  calculation of the actual route, simultaneously guarantying its existence; they are a subset of the full solution. </p><br><br><p>Is this a heuristic approach?</p><br><br><p>(as I understand, normally, heuristics don't guarantee existence of a solution, and merely suggest more likely candidates.
